Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606698,"Instead of starting at Springer and hiking to Maine, then turn around and hike back to Springer, we have come up with a new way for our yoyo. We will start in Damascus and hike to Katahdin, then hike back to Damascus in 160 days averaging 21.5 per day. Then get off trail for ten days to go on a cruise with friends, then return to Damascus and hike to Springer before turning around and finishing at Damascus. This will save us from renting a car to go on a cruise bc our family only lives and hr away and it also will allow us to celebrate with family in Damascus when we finish the trail. So, i guess it is logistics and getting to finish near family. We have NOBO twiced finishing at Katahdin and SOBO once finishing at Springer so this will also be a new finishing place. The adventure begins March 21. GOD BLESS.","

Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608158,"We start in 5 days, again if you are following us we are doing an unconventional yoyo. We start in Damasacus to Katahdin then back to Springer then back to Damascus. We are doing this because our family is 1hr away from damascus. We want to be close to family when we finish because it will be our 5th thru hike of the AT as a couple and for the people that know us we dont hike the AT for any records, we have been told 5 thrus for a couple and a female might be the most for a couple or female. Like i said we dont care about that we just love the AT because it has been such a big part of our lives since we first set foot on the AT march 27 of 2010. We had never hiked in our lives and since then we have thru hiked the AT 3 times, been married at Springer and hiked the AT for our honeymoon summitting Katahdin on our 1 yr anniversary to doing trail magic every year around the smoky mtns. So we hope to meet and make many more new friends along the way. GOD BLESS, and thank you for following our journey.

The church had a bus set up with hot drinks,sodas,snacks,banana nut bread and more. We stayed there for about an hr talking about GOD and how are hike has been going. We then climbed again before walking 2 miles thru rhododendron bushes before reaching partnership shelter where we stopped for lunch.

We were up this morning with blue skies and sunshine with a temp of 34. We had a 550ft descent in 1.5 miles to the Settlers Museum and the Lindamond Schoolhouse which was built in 1894. We then had to shed one jacket because it was finally warming up. Then in the next 2.8 we made it into Atkins Va. We were at exit 50 on I81. We had to wait 1hr for The Barn Restuarant to open but it was worth the wait. We had 12 inch Philly Cheesesteak and Chickensteak with onion rings. They gave us huge portions for the price and also gave us bottles of water free to fill our water bottles. They said they wanted us to have good water, not tap water. They are very nice people who bought the place in November. Ratmans patient in Wytheville who he used to treat, his daughter was the previous owner. We met the famous Rambunny, who is a female thru hiker who hiked the AT 3 yrs in a row. She is one of 9 ladies to thru hike 3 times, so i was in the same room with 2 ladies who are tied with 3 thru hikes. Rambunny was picking up sharon to shuttle her back to Damascus. We started hiking again around 2 by crossing under I81 and heading for Bland. We had to climb 1000ft before dropping down to 2600ft in 6.7 miles and making camp. We built a fire by the stream and camped with Kenny, a young man from Greenville SC. We want to thank Sharon for hiking with us, sorry for killing you on that 21 mile day.

We then made our way over to Va. 742 in 1.5 miles and crossed a footbridge over the North fork of the Holston River. We ran into a older gentleman who was finishing up his thru hike he started last yr. He said he had to make it to Damascus and he was finished. We told him this was our 4th and he looked amazed and wanted to run away from these to crazy people lol. We then hiked another mile before reaching Bear Garden Hiker Hostel where we are holing up so the rain will pass thru tonight. We made it here at 11 and will head out around 8 tomorrow. We have a huge climb up to Chestnut Knob where the Biltmore was suppose to be built before they settled on Asheville. We have been talking the last week and have decided to only do one thru instead of 2 because we have so many friends up the trail that we want to spend time with along the way. This way we dont have to hike 25 a day and can enjoy the hike. We are planning on getting to Katahdin on July 6th with 2 friends coming up to hike it with us and then they are dropping us off at Grayson Highlands to hike back to Springer to complete our thru hike. We are calling this our last AT thru we have decided 4 is enough and we want to experience some new adventures with family and esoecially our grandbabies. So pray for us and thank you for following along on this last journey across the Appalachians. Also some have asked how they can send gift cards or care packages along the way, we will know more in about a week and will post info on how u can send something.

While we were sitting there 2 more young men thru hiking passed us, one from Va and the other Austin Tx. We then had a 2100ft climb in 4.6 miles to Chestnut Knob Shelter which is an enclosed shelter overlooking Burkes Garden. We made it to the top at 130 with the wind blowing and cold temps. We ate lunch before running practically for 3 miles to warmup. We started ridgeline hiking with a few steep climbs and very rocky terrain at 3800ft. We made it to Va. 623 which leads to Burkes Garden, we were hoping someone would offer us a ride into town but no luck. We had 4.5 more miles to the shelter and our next water source. It was getting cold with the sun setting so we hiked fast just to stay warm. We made it by 7 and wanted to just get in the tent, eat and get warm. The two guys had made it as well.

We built a fire and dried some of the tent while drinking coffee and talking to the two young hikers who stayed at the shelter with us. Today is a special day for us , it was 9 yrs ago today that we joined the hiking community standing on top of Springer getting reading to hike to Maine. What a great hiking adventure it has been every step after that day. Well, we started hiking at 1030 with a 800ft climb in 1 mile followed by a 2.5 mile easy ridge hike. We then descended to Va. 615 in 1 mile for a break. We then climbed 600ft via switchbacks and in refreshing warm sun. Then we basically hiked parallel to the ridge and hiked thru a fire area before reaching a gravel road. We then hiked .6 down to the road and stuck our thumb out for the ride to Subway in Bland. It took 5 cars but a nice elderly gentlemen gave us a ride to Subway. We make it a tradition to eat at Subway every time we thru hike thru this area.

Our hats are off to the Sheriffs Office and County police there in Bland, thank u for the ride. It was sunny and warm finally when we started. We first had to road walk .8 downhill before entering the woods. We had a 400ft climb first off which is good to get warm and also get the blood pumping. The climb wasnt to bad and we reached the shelter turnoff in 1.4 more miles. We didnt stop at the shelter because it was .3 off trail so we kept hiking. We then did mostly ridgeline hiking with a few minor climbs. We stoppped for lunch around 1 agter 8.5 miles of hiking. When we started back we met Mike who is a 71yr old man trying to hike all 3 long distance trails in 1yr. We crossed Va. 611 where me and marcia in 2010 started our longest hike for 1 day on the AT of 34 miles. Mike was out of water so we split what we had left for the 3 miles to Jennys Knob Shelter where we found water. We said our goodbyes and started hiking downhill for 1.2 miles until we found camp around 4:30. We are only doing around 14 for the next 3 days to reach pearisburg Sunday morning bc Sunday the temps is suppose to be 47 and rain. We will stay in a hostel there before hiking on Monday.

We then hiked 2 miles down to Va. 606 after crossing a long suspension bridge. We then walk .5 up the road to trents grocery for pizza. While there the elderly locals were hanging out drinking coffee and shooting the bull. We sat next to them, 7 guys total and shot the bull as well. They asked about our hike and one guy even knew some people back in Lee County where we are from. They also told us we were starting to hike thru the area where Robert Smith in late 1970's killed 2 hikers at Wapiti shelter. We told them we already knew that because my wife read the book, murder on the appalachian trail. We had our pizza and bought a few supplies before walking the .5 back to the trail. The locals at Trents were a hoot to talk with but we had to get hiking. We had a slight climb up to Dismal Falls before we started leveling out and walking thru tunnels of rodedendron bushes. After 5 miles we stopped for a break and to dry our tent out bc it had some dampness from the evening before. After our break we started hiking thru an area that looks like Colonial times and instead of hikers there should be horse draw buggys coming thru the area. We were surrounded by pine trees and cedar trees and every now and then more rhododendron tunnels. We also hiked along the trout stream before reaching a 120o ft climb up to 3800ft where we have mads camp tonight. We are as high up on the mtn as u can be, so it should be a pretty sunset and sunrise. Todays elevation was 3725ft.

We met two gentlemen cutting blow downs off the trail. We stopped and thank them and the one said hey i know you. Back in 2015 he was in Maine hiking to Katahadin to finish his section thru hike of the AT and we had camped with him at one of the shelters. He asked to take our photo before we left.

After making our way down to the road crossing and having .5 to the road to start the walk into town the trail took a left after entering the woods and actually climbed up and around a cliff before finally reaching the parking at the bottom. This new route added .5 miles to the AT which was not in the book. After reaching the parking lot 2 young men were loading up after finishing a section hike, luckily they gave us a ride to hardees because a .9 would have been a 1.3 mile walk uphill to town.

Then we had a break and two section hikers passed us but then all 4 of us had a rock walking on top of the ridge for about 2 miles. This slowes you down and can be tough mentally. We found out they were pastors from the Raleigh area and they loved our shirts. We then started a gradual down of 1500ft to Niday Shelter where we had a break. The weather was the best so far with 75 degree temps. The two pastors met us at the shelter and we chatted for a few, they mentioned they were getting off at the bottom bc their car was there in 1.2 miles. The one pastors trail name was crispy creme and he gave us the rest of his cooking fuel along with packing our garbage out.

On the way down we met a Southbounder who asked to interview and video us for his blog. We finally made the road and ran .4 to the store. We had a hunts pizza with all the toppings, the girl put at least 10lbs of topping on the pizza. We said the toppings that fell off we could make another pizza.

They were asking us which trail to take, but one guy and his daughters drove off the mtn and brought us some cold water. We had run out and didnt want to start climbing up until we had some water. So, after getting water we starting climbing at 4:30.

We had 9.3 to go so we headed out with the first 2 miles were very easy followed by a few short climbs along the ridge before entering the woods below the ridgeline. The trail became good so we made great time. We then hiked up to the ridgeline again and had some more up and downs around boulder fields which slowed us down along with the rain. We then reached the point where the trail took a hard left and we knew it was only 2 miles to Daleville. We followed swithbacks and then level trail before crossing the rr tracks and then a bridge which we camped on in 2010. We then emerged in Daleville and made the short walk to Howards Johnson. They are great here and are so helpful to the hikers. We are now doing laundry and getting dry. GOD BLESS.","

Of course we couldnt see anything bc of the dense fog. We then passed Harveys Knob Overlook before coming to Bobblets Gap Shelter. We were considering stopping here for a break but decided to push on passed Peaks of the Otter Overloook and then stopped at Mills Gap Overlook for a break and a snack. We then started down to Va 43 before starting a 600ft climb to the top of Cove mtn. Then we hurried 1.9 down to Cove Mtn Shelter to have lunch and to see if it was going to rain.

We then descended 1000ft to Va. 614, Jennings Creek where it seems there is great trout fishing. We always see trout fishermen when we cross this road. We then started a 1100ft climb to the top of fork mtn. On the way up we met a couple from Cleveland, Ohio on a day hike. Ratman said he lived in Cleveland Ohio until he was 10, the couple was shocked but we think they were more shocked bc we told them this was our 4th thru hike of the AT in 9yrs.

We made the summitt before descending down to the Cornelius Shelter for a break. We then started anothee 1200ft climb up to the radar dome that you see when driving the parkway at 4200ft. We then hiked under the Guillotine which is a huge boulder wedged between two other huge boulders that the trail goes underneath. We then crossed the BRP and hiked .3 to Thunder Hill Shelter. We had lunch and then headed out about 2 with sunshine. But, about 2 mile down the trail it started raining and thunder/lightening above us. We hurried about 1 more mile before we came to a spring and camping, so we put up next to the young boy who we camped with the night before. After getting in the tent it started raining harder then turned to hail with lightening. It did this for about an hr before letting up. We then checked the weather for tonight and it looked bad so we told the young boy if he wanted we could pack up and hike 1.5 miles more to pettit gap.

When we reached the Gunter Ridge trail we hooked a right and started our descent to Matts Creek Shelter. We had a 1800ft descent in 3.2 miles. The sun had made its presence and it began to get hot. When we reached the shelter we had to ford the creek, we had never seen this creek so high that we had to ford it to get to the shelter.

This Monument tells of a teacher back in 1891 sending her students out to gather wood for the stove, littke Ottie who was 5 wanted to go and ended up wandering off but did not return. A search was organized later to find little Ottie with no luck. In April 1892, a hunter crossing over Bluff Mountain found Otties body. It has become a tradition for hikers who pass by to leave toys for little Ottie. We then descended in 1.6 miles to the Punchbowl shelter where we ate and filled back up with water. We then went from 2500ft all the way down to 990ft at Va. 607 crossing the BRP at mile 51.7. When we reached the bottom we stopped for lunch before crossing Pedlar River Bridge and to our amazement looked below and seen the water full of frogs. At first we didnt realize but there were two frogs together everywhere mating, it was a crazy scene. We then hiked 4.9 miles around a large lake/reservoir before reaching the Brown Mtn Creek Shelter. We stopped for about 10 minutes before hiking 1.9 miles up to U.S. 60. While hiking this section we walked thru an area where the browns had settled and we seen two old fireplaces still standing along with rock walls still standing. When we reached the road we hitched a ride into Buena Vista to eat and get some supplies for the last 54 miles to Waynesboro. The nice man who gave us a 10 mile ride down the mtn was from Twin Springs, small world bc we played them in high school sports, because we were in the same district. He knew ratmans tennis partner in college who was from Twin Springs and he worked with tumblers sister.

We have never been to this shelter because its .6 and a hiker was murdered there and his body was found behind a log. We then hiked thru some balds and made it to Cole Mountain with plenty of sunshine. We then hiked down to Hog Camp Gap where we stopped for a snack in a grassy field. Ratman had to walk .3 to a spring to get water. After our break we we climbed up to Tar Jacket Ridge where there was a bald and 360 degree views. We hiked over to Salt Log Gap and then made our way to Seeley-Woodworth Shelter where we had stayed in 2010. We had lunch and took a 1hr break bc we had done 13 miles.

We started off by crossing the BRP at mile 13.1 where three ridges parking overlook is located. We then hiked 3.8 miles on some very rocky but flat areas parallelling the BRP on the left side until we reached cedar cliffs with great views to the West.

We got lucky because it rained litely 2 differant times but not even enough to get us wet. We then ran into Dave and Jill who have also volunteered at the same church as we do, they were on a weekend hike with some high school kids. It was amazing running into them out in the middle of nowhere, Jill was kind enough to call a couple who housed us for the night and offered for us to stay with her tomorrow night. So, we started our descent down to Paul Wolfe Shelter and after 14.1 miles made it at around 2:30. While there we talked with a Girl Scout troop who sang happy bday to me bc tomorrow is my bday, and gave me a pack of peanut butter cookies as a gift. We talked to them about the trail and taught them some trail lingo. We then hiked 5 miles on easy and relatively flat ground up to Rockfish Gap. We passed the Lowes Family Cemetary and the remains of the Mayo Cabin dating back to the 1900's. We made Rockfish at 5 and our hosts where there to pick us up and we headed to Golden Corral for supper. Funny thing was when we arrived there we seen a group from MEOC where Marcia used to work. We kind of stared at each other before saying hey i know you. We ate until we popped and then headed to their house for a shower and laundry. Also right before reaching the Gap someone had left protein shakes in the creek as trail magic. See, GOD knew we needed a day like this bc of the bad day we had the day before.

We then heard a noise to the left and seen 2 snakes at first we thought they were fighting or mating but when we looked closer, one had 2 frog legs in its mouth while the other had the head. They were playing tug of war, funny thing was when we took a picture they let go and the frog hopped away, i guess they both lost and the frog won. We then reached the point where we finally entered W.Va. and left Va. We then crossed the Shenandoah River Bridge on U.S. 340. We then hiked the the 1 mile over to where you cross Potomac River in downtown Harpers Ferry. We passed the Jeffersons Rock along the way and some old churches. We then walked thru town to the AT trail Conservancy to have our pic for the fourth time. While there we looked at our other 3 thru hike pics. We are here for the night thanks to an anonymous friend who paid for our lodging. We want to thank you and the person who paid for our breakfast anonymously. We also want to thank everyone following us and helping us on this record setting journey as we say bye to the AT and its many rocks, roots and ups with the downs. We love being out here with nature and also witnessing to people about Jesus. We have so many people come up to us and tell us they love our shirts and that they are happy we arnt afraid to wear Jesus on our chests. Thank everyone again and thank you to put us up tonight the room is great and the people are so nice here. GOD BLESS. Also a few mileage stats we have hiked 564.9 miles and our elevation is at 118,901 ft so far.","

We started by leaving Harpers Ferry via to C&O canal towpath which you can walk or bike 60 miles into DC. After about 3 miles we made a left crossed the RR tracks and climbed up to the Weaverton Cliffs overlooking the river and back towards Harpers Ferry. We then hiked 2.1 miles to the Ed Garvey Shelter for a break. The path was mostly level but rocky. We then hiked 3.7 to the Gathland State Park for lunch. After eating we started climbing 700ft then the trail started down to the shelter where we are staying. We are at Rocky Run Shelter, we stayed with 3 great guys, we had a good evening talking about the trail. Also at Ed Garvey Shelter in 2015 a young man was killed in his tent by a tree falling on him when the storms came thru, at that time we were in PA. avoiding those same storms. GOD BLESS.","

We started out on good terrain and level ground. We stayed around 950ft for the first 1.8 miles until we came to the Dahlgren Backpacker Campground. Here they have tentsites,showers and electricity all for free. There were several hikers there packing and getting ready to head north or south on the AT. We stopped for a bathroom break before starting our climb up to 1500ft. We first crossed U.S. Alt 40 at Turners Gap before crossing Monument Road and then Washington Monument Road. Then we came to the Washington Monument, the first monument built dedicated to George Washington built in 1827. At this time you couldnt go up in the monument bc it was going thru repairs. We then levelled out and made good time over Bartman Hill before crossing US 40, I70 footbridge and taking a break for a snack. We then climbed up to Annapolis Rocks in 2 miles, this is where we have stopped to watch people rock climb before on our other thru hikes. We then hiked about 4 more miles on very rocky terrainn passing section hikers heading South. We stopped for lunch at 1 after 14 miles of hiking. We then crossed MD17 and then MD. 77 before finally crossing MD. 491 and climbing up for .5 and then level .5 to our shelter for the night.

Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611543,"This morning we woke up to rain and didnt want to get out of our tent. But, we climbed out at 7:30 and 5 minutes on the trail and we hear our first thunder rumbling in the valley below. Luckily we were on flat ridgeline and could hike fast. We knew 4.7 miles and we were at Pen-Mar state park with covered pavilions. After 1.8 miles we came to a big boulder field and then we started our descent on a very very rocky trail. The rain was light and we still had only heard 1 thunder boomer. After getting off the ridgeline and passing 3 day hikers heading the other direction it started raining harder. It rained hard for about 10 minutes then stopped completely. We heard lightning to our left so we sped up and came to the park at 9. Its funny how thunder and lighting speed up the hiking pace, we hiked 4.7 miles in 1hr and 40 minutes. We sat under a pavavillon for about 20 minutes before deciding to get off trail for the evening bc of real bad weather coming. This nice guy gave us a ride to a very cheap motel but clean for the evening. Since it was a short day we are going to talk about some memories from Rockfish Gap to Pa. Line in 4 thru hikes. First we wanted to mention meeting walkingman and joe coming out of damascus in 2012 who remain great friends and also camping with seeker outside damascus in 2010 and she remains a great friend. In the Shenandoahs we remember having breakfast in a parking lot with Spirit and her leaving first and about .5 up trail we pass her backpack sitting by the trail, so we knew y she left but as we passed we seen a bear heading her way. Also almost running headfirst into a bear walking down the trail in 2010, or stepping on a copperhead in 2012 almost ratmans foot was coming down on it when he seen the snake below his foot. Also meeting Squatch at Lewis Mtn Campground which started our acting careers in 2012, yes we are in the movie flip flop flippin 2. The funniest is when nanner in 2010 camping with him at Big Meadows he spent half the night chasing a raccoon who stole is food. Also Mr. Fab trying to sneak up on us coming off Marys Rock, he had been chasing us for 3 days. Catching a ride back to the trail in the back of a post office truck after eating buffalo burger near I66. Completing the Roller Coaster 4 times now and living tell about it. Also meeting Y's Guy just before entering the roller coaster in 2012. Him and Spirit hiked the last 1000 miles with us in 2012 and even though Ratman tried to kill them both with huge miles we remain friends until this day. Finally getting a ride in the back of a police cruiser into Waynesboro to eat at Applebees for Fathers Day in 2012, the looks on peoples faces in Applebees when we got out of the cruiser and joined them for lunch can we say priceless. If we have forgotten some stories and you read this please share with us as we try to remember some great things that have happened to us hiking this great trail over the yrs. Also one other thing meeting Tequilla John for the first time at Gathland State Park and hiking on and off with him the rest of the way along with tillerman. GOD BLESS","

We started by descendimg to Buena Vista Road then crossing Old PA. 16. The weather was great with blue skies and sunshine but winds blowing 20 to 40 miles an hr.

We then hiked 2.4 miles descending down to 890ft before climbing 300ft in 1.3 miles, reaching Tumbling Run Shelter for a snack break. These two shelter state one is for snorers and the other non snorers. We have camped here on all 3 thru hikes because its a neat place but our mileage didnt workout this time. We then climbed 800ft to chimney rocks before descending down to Swamp Road where we met some young kids around 12 yrs old with 4 chaperones. They were on a 3 day hike and they invited us to eat with them. We had pitas with cream cheese and bagels as well. We talked about the trail and answered all their question before moving on. We then climbed up to 1800ft and reached Rocky Run Shelter but didnt go .3 over the hill, we just continued hiking. We then had about 1 mile of hiking on,in and around a ridgeline boulder field before finally descending down to U.S. 30, and entering Caledonia State Park. We took our last break here for about 15 minutes before setting our sites on 2 more miles to camp. We started with a 500ft climb then basically fllat trail until the last .4 up to the shelter.

We then reached the 2018 halfway sign then came out to a parking area where we met this nice family from New York who gave us some water, she told us she wants to hike the trail someday. We thanked them and told her if she has any question just ask and we will help all we can. We then had to take a reroute bc they were doing a or had done a controlled burn in the area. We then descending down to the Toms Run Shelter where we stopped for a break then continued on for the next mile in nothing but water and mudholes in the trail. We finally reached Pine Grove Furnace State Park where the Half Gallon Ice Cream challenge takes place. Here u can buy a half gallon for 9 or 10 dollars and see how fast u can eat it in, we didnt waste our money on that instead we had chicken strips with fries. The AT Museum is here as well.

The hiking was relativly flat with a few minor climbs with rocks. At mile 2.7 we hit another milestone of hiking 12000 miles since 2010. We then hiked 4 more miles on pretty good terrain with very few climbs and then a down to Pa. 34 and a .2 mile walk east to the Green Mountain Store and Deli. They were hiker friendly and the food was great. We spent 30 minutes in the store before heading back out to get to Boiling Springs. We had a few 200 to 300ft climbs but nothing major with perfect weather. We then came to a huge boulder scramble where we had to climb over,around and down many huge boulders. After completing that we still had 5 miles to go. We seen some day hikers and section hikers so we knew we were getting close. When we were about 2 miles out we started a 1.5 mile hike thru fields with barns that have the huge silos attached to them. The last .3 into Boiling Springs we walked past a naturally made spring reservoir about the length of 3 football fields where people come to walk,ride bikes,sit and have picnics along with trout fishing. We finally made it to the ATC Mid-Atlantic Office where we sat and waited on our two friends from New York who were in the area. We seen 2 trout caught while we sat and had lunch. We also met a family of 3 out for the day who came over and talked to us about our hike. We were happy bc we had done 17.6 miles by 1:30. Walking man and his wife Debra made it around 2:30. We talked and caught up for awhile before we had to get hikimg again and they had to get on the road back to New York. They resupplied us, we said our goodbyes until the next time. It was great seeing them again.

In 1 mile we crossed I76 Pennsylvania Turnpike then crossed U.S. 11 on a pedestrain footbridge. We then crossed over I81 before coming to the ATC Scott Farm Trail Work Center after 4 miles. We then hiked about 3 more miles following the river on dirt paths and boardwalks before coming to a spring where we took a break and had a snack.

We then started a descent down to 650ft before walking thru some fields and starting a climb up to the ridgeline. Once we climbed to 1300ft we ridgeline hiked on very rocky trail until we reached Hawk Rock where you have a view of Duncannon down below. We could see subway from up on top and we set our sites for Subway. We hiked 1.3 down again on very rocky terrain until we hit pavement below.

We climbed 1.5 miles from 400ft up to 1180ft before reaching ridgeline. We then rock scrambled 1 mile before a light rain started falling and we found the first flat spot and set up camp. Along the way we crossed yesterday the Rocky Knob Trail that intersects the AT, Ratman read a book where a guy followed to girls who took this side trail to a water source and shot both of them but one survived and identified him and he was captured in Fla. Then we passed stopped in Cove Mtn Shelter today where we stayed in 2010 and the next day found out a local had hiked in and killed two hikers yrs ago.

We had to walk on logs,wade in water,mud hiking and finally after about .5 made it back on dry land. We didnt skip any trail and when we made the top of the mtn the reroute would have been .7 longer.

We then hiked on 3 miles on good easy level terrain until we reached the dreaded knifes edge. We had to hike across huge boulder cliffs which were slick from the early rain and fog. Theses cliffs are only .2 but take 15 to 30 minutes to hike across because they are so dangerous. Perk said who thought this would be a great idea to bring the trail across these cliffs, we said they have cameras in the trees sitting at home laughing as hikers make there way across.

Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613116,"Last night we went over to the Deer Head Inn a very old historical hotel to listen to a live jazz band. We started hiking this morning at 6:30 with Perk our hiking buddy. We started out by crossing the Deleware River on the bridge, about half way over we crossed into New Jersey. We then crossed under I80 and started climbing from 350ft to 1400ft. We entered the Dunnfield Creek Natural Area and as we climbed we had small waterfalls to our right. As we climbed we were hiking in fog and the wind was blowing rain off of the trees. After 5.4 miles we reached Sunfish Pond where Ratman would catch perch about every cast but didnt have his rod this time around. The trail was great with hardly any rocks until we started around the pond. We then had boulders to hop on and around for about .5 mile. We then climbed up to 1600ft but still had no views bc of the dense fog. We hiked thru some very muddy trail along the way but after 10.4 miles we came to a gravel road and the three of us decided to hike .3 up to the Mohican Outdoor Center, in 2012 we picked 3 gallon of blueberries here with Spirit. We ate breakfast with Perk, we had the hiker breakfast which was pancakes,eggs,sausage and toast with the best raspberry preserves we have ever had before. Plus we had unlimited coffee. The staff was very nice and catered to the hikers. We then left Perk there because we had sat there for 1.5 hrs and it was time to go. We had to climb up to the ridgeline then hiked on great flat easy trail for 4 miles until we came to a beaver pond and seen 2 water moccasins mating in a downed tree, we also seen some huge bullfrogs in the pond. We then 4 more miles on great level dirt paths until we reached crater lake and then passed the Hemlock Pond Trail. I told marcia at the next outcropping of rocks we would take a break and when i came to them i almost stepped on a rattlesnake sunnin by the rocks. But after inspecting the rattlesnake it never looked at us or rattled bc it was looking at a 7ft blacksnake sitting 10ft in front of him in the bushes. We thought maybe the blacksnake was going to kill him but after 30 minutes waiting the blacksnake crawled to a rock and went under the rock. We left a note warning hikers of the snake bc it was shedding also and never moved from its spot. We then hiked another mile before finding water and filling up for camp. We had to hike about 1 more mile before setting up for the night. We hiked 22.6 miles today. We want to thank Nemo for sending us new pads and their great customer service. Also want to thank Altra who makes our hiking shoes bc they are sending Marcia a new pair free of charge bc her toebox tore. They have great customer service and great shoes. GOD BLESS","

Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613193,"Today we did 22.6 miles on trail but 24 total with extra hiking for water and breakfast. We started at 6 this morning to overcast skies and cool temps. For the first 2 miles we stayed on the ridgeline around 1450ft before reaching the Brink Shelter sign but we didnt stop, so we continued 1.5 with views of a lake to the East. We then hiked 2 more miles before descending down to Culvers Gap NJ. The AT deli was up for sale which was a disappointment but 2 guys said there was a market just around the bend so we walked and didnt find one but came to Jumboland diner so we had breakfast. They had a 3 egg omelette with potatoes and toast for 3.99. It actually was a lot of food but we didnt think it would be so we ordered 1 order of pancakes which were huge and we ended up packing 2 pancakes and half the toast in our backpacks. We hitched a ride with a nice man back to the trail. We climbed up in 2 miles to the Culver Fire Tower where Ratman climbed to the top and took some photos. We then hiked on mostly flat with some rock trail thru the woods just winding around and thru the forest. After about 4 miles we came to the Sunrise Pavillion where in Jennifer Pharr Davis book about her thru hike, when she arrived here a guy had just committed suicide, i couldnt imagine hiking upon a scene like that. We then hiked 3.8 on about the same kind of terrain until we reached the next shelter right on the trail. We sat and talked with a group of 4 weekend hikers from New Jersey, and while we were talking a 5ft bkack snake fell out of the shelter rafters right beside us in the shelter. We then 6 more miles just still winding thru the woods with little elevation change staying around 1300ft to 1600ft. It was a great weather day to hike with blue skies and a slight breeze. We reached the high point vistors center around 4:45 and we stopped to eat a snack before heading on to find camp. We headed out by climbing up to this Observation Platform in 1 mile where you can take pictures of New Jersey State high point. We then hiked 1.4 miles before finding a camp spot for the night. We want to ask that everyone pray for the hikers around Adkins Virginia where a hiker from what we have seen killed one thru hiker and sent one to the hospital. They captured the guy responsiable. GOD BLESS.","

Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613298,"This morning it was raining and the forecast was rain and temps in upper 40's. We really didnt want to hike but had to get going. After calling mom and wishing her a Happy Mothers Day we started hiking around 7. We had a .5 descent to a road crossing and then we were in the woods where the wind wasnt hitting us or the rain. But, we had fields to hike thru, road crossings and some woods. After 7.3 miles and the both of us cold,wet and tired bc of the muddy trail plus many boardwalks thru swampy areas we came to N.J 284 and at that moment a nice lady pulled over and asked if we needed anything. Then she said get in and go to church with me and we can get u warm and also some hot fresh coffee. We loaded up and went to church in Unionville. The pastor thru hiked in 2013 and one church member in this small world we live in attended Lee High School where our kids all graduated from. We had a great service on Mothers Day and then went to the pastors house for lunch. We then were picked up by Adriane and Mary Joe the lady who picked us up and we are staying with them tonight. We both prayed that the Lord would put someone at one of the road crossing and save us from the rain, HE DID see GOD does answer prayers. Happy Mothers Day to all mothers out there and GOD BLESS.","

The trail has turned into a swamp in spots and really slows the hiking down. We hiked 2 miles around 400ft until we reached the Walikil National Wildlife Preserve. The trail hikes around 3/4th of the preserve, we seen baby Canadian Geese and other birds. On our other thrus we have seen differant species of snakes,deer,turtles and birds. We then boardwalked until we crossed Lake Walikill Road and started climbing up to 1200ft to the top of Pochuck Mtn. We then hiked 2.5 miles in the woods on muddy and swampy trail before crossing County Road 565. We then hiked .7 on a boardwalk with one break between the 2 sections before crossing the suspension bridge across Pochuck Swamp. We then hiked 2.1 miles in the rain until we reached N.J. 84, Vernon NJ. We hiked .2 down to the Heaven Hill Farm which is a garden center and baked goods. The rain cont to get harder and wasnt suppose to stop until 11 tonight so we called it a day after 10.8. We dont mind hiking in the rain when the temp is in the 70's but 47 its just to cold.

It was a great surprise, she ordered us pizza for dinner and had it delivered. When the driver knocked on the door he asked if we ordered pizza and we told him no and then about closed the door but he said i think u did and the bill has already been paid. This morning we caught a ride back to the trail and started hiking at 10. The first .4 was field walking then we started a .9 climb 900ft to the top of Wawayanda Mtn. We then just hiked thru the woods with a few small up and down along with crossing a few streams on footbridges. The trail continues to be flooded and rocky in places. After 8.8 miles we climbed up on these boulders and started hiking across them. In .3 we reached the New York line and after about 1 mile in NY it started raining pretty hard on us. We spent the next 3 to 4 miles hiking on,down,up,over and thru boulders and rocks. The rain continued and so did the boulders, it was dangerous bc we both need new shoes and with the rocks wet and our shoes having very little traction it was very slippery and slow hiking. We then came to some dirt path that was mostly under water and hiked 2 miles until we reached NY17 and are stealth camping tonight. We stopped short bc we were freezing and it had stopped raining long enough to set up our tent. Then after getting in the tent it has rained constantly. Its suppose to be 65 and sunny tomorrow, we pray thats true. GOD BLESS","

We started hiking at 7 climbed 1.5 miles up to a huge boulder field that we had to hike over and then we came to Wildcat Shelter but didnt stop. We kept hiking for 2 more miles before reaching Lakes Road and stopping to get water. While filling up i bet 15 hikers went by with some saying they all stayed at the shelter, we havent seen but 3 hikers in 4 days and then bam 15 in ten minutes. We then hiked up to a rock outcropping 2.5 miles and dried our stuff. We then went by Fitzgerald Falls which was overflowing due to all the rain. Then we had to hike on a muddy trail for most of the day. We realized so far New York was like a roller coaster, just small up and downs with very muddy trail. We then reached Harriman State Park after 11 miles and also crossing I87. We then hiked up into the park finally reaching the Lemon Squeezer where these huge boulders are close together and you have to hike between them. It is very hard with a pack on then after that you rock climb up a rock facing for 20 or 30ft. Then after all that we made it to the turnoff for Lake Tiorati Beach but we kept hiking because it was getting late. We hiked about 1 mile and found a stream to get camp water and met a couple section hiking from Brevard NC. We then hiked .5 and set up camp.GOD BLESS","

We started by climbing up 200ft then the trail levelled out and we made good time for the first 3 miles. We then made it up to a view of the skyline of New York City. We then hiked 2 miles down and crossed the Palisade Interstate Parkway which is 34 miles from New York City. We have to cross 2 lanes of traffic twice as cars our flying by at 80 miles an hr. We then started climbing back up with views to the West of the surrounding mtns. After all the up and downs and 12.4 miles we reached the Bear Mtn Tower where we treated ourselves with a soda. While sitting there 4 Japanese visitors saw our backpacks and asked about the AT. After talking to them we hiked down 1288 rock steps until we reached the bottom where Bear Mtn Inn and park are located. We went into the Inn to charge our phones, its 149 and up to stay here. We then hiked thru the Bear Mtn Zoo then crossed the Bear Mtn Bridge over the Hudson River. We then climbed up for .8 on very steep terrain before it levelled. We hiked 4 more miles on mostly level terrain, actually the best terrain since reaching New York. We made it to Appalachian Deli on NY 22. We hike right in front of the deli so we had a huge pizza, then resupplied to get us to Kent. We met to theu hikers there who showed up after us and one guy from Indiana bought a half gallon ice cream and shared it with all of us. We then hiked 1.1 and found a nice spot to stop for the day.

Today was first day we could start out hiking in our tshirts with no long sleeve undershirt. The day started out like the rest of New York just short up and downs with no flat trail. We hiked 2.3 miles before crossing Chapman rd. Then we 1.7 before reaching Canopus rd. We stayed between 600ft and 900ft the first 4 miles. We then climbed to 1000ft at mile 6 and stopped for our first break. We then hiked 4 more miles on the same terrain before finally hiking on flat terrain for 1 mile and reaching NY 301. After crossing the road we entered Clarence Fahnestruck State Park. We took our second break after 11 miles and right after we started back in began to rain for 2hrs. We hiked in the rain for about 5 miles on the same terrain of up and downs but less rockyband swampy today. After 7 miles we reached the RPH Shelter where you can order pizza. This also is where all the other hikers where staying so we pushed on for 5.1 more miles. The first 3 miles was climbing on the side of the mtn. This mtn had many huge trees down from the hurricane that ripped through the East coast 2 yrs ago when New York City was flooded. We crossed a road then hiked 1.8 over to N.Y. 22 where we hiked east .4 down to the deli where they allow hikers to camp behind the store free. We were the only hikers that knew of this place so we are the only ones here. We ordered a small calizone but when we received it, it was huge.

After reaching the Morgan Stewart Shelter for a break at 1285ft we started hiking faster on better terrain. Todays weather was the best since starting our hike. We crossed N.Y. 55 and in 1.4 miles we reached nuclear lake. This is where we were thrown out in 2010 bc you are not allowed to camp here and about 7 of us thru up tents after swimming. About 9 a lady drove up and thru us out bc you cant camp here. We just picked our tent up and carried it into the woods and went to bed. We talked with a guy and his granddaughters who were fishing before heading back out. We hiked 5 more miles before reaching County Road 20 where the largest Dover Oak is on the AT. We stopped for lunch and remarked on seeing a blacksnake ball where 3 snakes were all twisted around each other. We had seen 6 snakes today and 2 deer. We then field walked 1 mile and then 1 mile in the woods before reaching N.Y. 22 where you can catch a train into NY. We stopped at the Native Landscape and Garden Center for a coke before heading back out. We hiked 1 mile up to 1010ft before reaching the woods again. Then we hiked on fairly level trail after reaching the top at 1010. We hiked 5 miles more until we reached the Wiley Shelter where we planned to camp but there was a huge group of boy scouts so we filled up with water and hiked on.

We then descended to the Ten Mile River Shelter where we camped in 2010 on the night Lebron made the decision to go to Miami. While there we met a great group camping at the shelter who gave us laura bars and we told them about our hiking trip.

We hiked on the side of Schaghticoke Mtn forever and finally reached some open ledges where you could look down on the Housatonic River. We met 4 guys section hiking from Ohio,Va and i cant remember the other state. We talked with them and hiked with them for a short bit until we came across a huge Black Timber Rattler which we videod and took photos for 15 minutes.

We then hiked 4 miles on easy flat terrain until we reached the cookie ladies home. The cookie lady and her husband give hikers cookies and log what state each hiker is from. They also sell ice cream, boiled eggs,gatorade,coke and homegrown blueberries. Sadly, the cookie lady informed us that her husband passed away 3 wks ago at the age of 85. We recommend all hikers to stop by and chat with her bc she loves the hikers and she has no one else there at the house with her. After talking with her for about an hr we headed back out bc we needed to hike 5 more miles before setting up camp. In those 5 miles we made great time bc the elevation never changed more than 100ft and the only thing that would slow us down was the mud bogs we came across every now and then.

We made the top at 6 and sat and talked with visitors enjoying the day on Greylock. After 30 minutes we headed on and only had to hike .5 before finding camp. We hiked 21.7 miles with 5100ft of elevation. One funny thing that happened on Greylock once to us was we asked a old gentleman to take our picture, he said yes and also said it must be nice to hike with your daughter when i replied thats my wife. Well, he handed back the camera and didnt take our picture and just walked off. Marcia thought it was funny but I on the other hand lets just say they will never find the body. GOD BLESS.","

I put the gentlemen walked away then jokingly said they would never find the body, thats why i said that after i said he walked away jusy jokingly. I thank JESUS who is a forgiving person bc he knows we make mistakes bc noone but JESUS is perfect thats Y we as Christians should be praying for each other instead of judging bc we all make mistakes. Today we started at 6 and started our long descent off of Greylock. In 6 miles we went from 3100ft to 650ft. On the way down we seen a bear but he ran before we could get a photo.

This down was not bacd the first 2.1 miles but after passing the shelter at 4:15 the last 1.5 took us 1hr and 40 minutes.

While up at Speck pond we ran into Tree hugger a thru hiker we hiked with in 2012. GOD BLESS","

After reaching the top with the last mile shear rock facing to climb up we had stunning views again. We then descended down to Frye Notch Lean-to for a snack. We then climbed up 600ft to Surplus Mtn before the trail smoothed out and we had a nice trail 4 miles until we reached East B. Hill Road, we had 10 miles in before 12 so we called a friend in Andover to see if they could give us a ride into Andoved for lunch and resupply. The friend is 87 and owns a hostel in Andover. We went in and had huge burgers for lunch, resupplied and we got back on trail at 1:30. We had great trail in the woods for the next 6 miles hiking around a lake and finally reaching Hall Mtn Lean-to. We then descended 1600ft 1.4 and crossed a stream and then climbed 1300ft in 1.3 to top of Moody Mtn. Believe us when we say Moody Mtn can put you in a mood by the top. You have rock steps,ladders,ropes and steel bars, its like a straight up obstacle course. We then had a 1000ft descent to camp. After 20.4 miles we arrived at 7. Not bad since we stayed in town 2hrs.

We then had rock scrambles, and some rock facings that you have to basically run up to keep your traction. We reached the top of old Blue and started our way over to Bemis Mtn. In 4 miles of basically small up and downs in the woods of pine,balsam firs and red spruce trees. We made the shelter around 1130 to have a snack and refill our water. We then started our descent down to 1550ft and crossed a gravel road and then forded the river before starting a huge .5 climb up to ME 17. When we made it to the road physics dad was there providing trail magic which was great. We then hiked up to spruce mtn and ratman fell in a mud bog. It was funny to us both since he didnt get hurt. We then hiked 7.5 around a lake and thru many mud bogs before reaching camp at 7:15. We were tired but we made 21.6 miles and camped with the young kids again for the night.

We dont want to mess up their schedule and dont want to rush thats why we are skipping this 30 mile section but will drive back up here in August and hike this sdction in good weather for two days after we hike Springer to Damascus. This section is one of the best in Maine and want to hike it in great weather and besides its a reason to come up and visits friends again. We might see if any friends or family wants to come hike it with us when we come up. The one thing we live by on all 3 thru hikes and this one is we will hike every inch of trail even though they say all you have to do is hike 2000 miles at least.

We made it to the shelter for a break and to get water from the enclosed spring. We then hike around West Carry Pond and thru Arnold Swamp which had many bog bridges. We then made it to East Carry Pond crossing many logging roads. It was another great day weather wise. We made it to Pierce Pond Lean-to where we took a break. We then had to hike across a wooden dam with one slip and your over a waterfall. We then hiked down towards the Kennebec with the stream beside us all the way down with views of waterfalls. We made camp about .5 from the river crossing. We were in camp by 3:30 after hiking 18 miles. We had to stop bc the ferry only runs 9 to 11 am.

We had to hike up shear rock facings and over many roots and boulders to reach the top. We had lunch at the top with many views bc the weather was perfect once again. We then started making our descent over the next 4.4 miles down to 1100ft. We were glad bc there was no water until we made it down, and it was a hot humid day. We then forded a brook before hiking 2 more miles on relatively flat trail remaining at around 1200ft. We reached Bald Mtn Lean-to at 5 and decided to stop after 16 miles.

We wanted to get started very early because our friends Sharon and Spirit were in Monson waiting on us to arrive. We had to climb Moxie Bald in the first 2 miles from 1280ft up to 2629ft. We made the summit at 5 with 360 degree views right as the sun was coming up over the horizon. It was a spectacular sight with views of the mtns and lake below with tbe sun just coming up. We then descended in 2 miles down to the shelter at 1220ft. We stopped for a quick break bc we still had 18 miles to go. We had messaged our friends to meet us in 12 more miles to slackpack us the last 6 miles. The next 4 miles stayed around 1200ft but the trail was rough with rock hopping,mud bogs,roots and water. We were still doing 20 minute miles and were doing great. We had to ford 3 differant streams along the way. We then descended to 990ft and stayed between that and 650ft for the next 6 miles which made the hiking easier and we could hike faster. We met them around 11:30 and we were so happy to see to familiar faces from home. We gave them our packs and we basically ran 6.2 miles with them hiking in 1 mile to meet us and then walk back to the road at ME 15.

I want to thank everyone at the Lakeshore House for all they did for us and will always highly recommend their hostel not only for the lodging but the food is the best in Monson. We started out by entering the 100 mile wilderness that you have to hike thru to get to Baxter State Park. We hiked the first 3 miles fairly easy and took a break at the Leeman Brook Lean-to. The weather again was great and we were taking our time since we had trail legs but they didnt. We then made our way in the next 3 miles up to the Rim of Bear Pond Ledges. Then in 1 mile we came to Little Wilson Falls which is 60ft high and one of the highest on the AT. We then crossed a beaver dam and walked about 100 yds on a gravel road. We then climbed up to a slate ridgeline that we had to hike on for about .2 or .3. Then in 2 miles we had to ford Big Wilson Stream. There are many fords in the 100 mile wilderness bc they dont put bridges across the streams and they get very high after snow melt. We then hiked up .7 to Wilson Valley Lean-to where the other person had made it to while we were helping Spirit. It was 4:30 and Spirit was struggling so we stopped here for the evening. After talking Spirit decided she would shuttle back to Monson and stay until we finished bc she took a couple falls and was having endurance problems. GOD BLESS.,"

We hiked 2 more miles before we had to ford Wilber Brook and this is where we ran into 10 to 15 SOBO hikers just starting their journey. It seemed every morning when we were close to the next shelter we would meet 10 to 20 SOBO thru hikers. We then forded Vaughn Stream at the top of a 20ft waterfall, this is where we camped in 2012. We then hiked .6 and forded Long Pond Stream which was almost knee deep. We then climbed .8 up to Long Pond Stream Lean-to. This is where ratman carried Spirits pack and led her .9 down to the extraction pt while tumbler and the other person waited at the shelter. We successfully got Spirit out and when ratman returned the other person had already left tumbler at the shelter by herself and hiked on with no concern for anyones safety. So, we started hiking again to catch up and we had to climb up to 2025ft from 870ft in 1.3 miles. Then we climbed up to the Summit of Barren Mtn where 6 SOBOs where taking a break and told us the other person was 10 minutes ahead. We ate at the top then started out again.

We then climbed up to the Gulf Hagas Loop Trail which people hike around to view all the waterfalls. We decided to not do that since we were behind schedule. We then started our gradual 900ft climb in 4.2 miles by a mountain stream up to Carl A. Newhall Lean-to where we stopped for lunch at 1.

There was 6 hikers trying to ford the creek so we helped each other cross except the person we have been mentioning. When we got her across she left with no concern for anyone else. We then hiked on flat trail but still some rock fields and mud bogs. We were making great time and stopped for lunch for 1hr after 11 miles. We then hiked on good trail with flat terrain for 4 miles to Jo Mary Road. We arrived at 130 and that person at 230. When she came to the road she literally said the best thing for me is to go home when i get picked up, leaving us with no transportation home. We had changed everything to meet up and hike with this person to finish up. We had no cell service and wouldnt for 3 more days to arrange a way home. We had no choice but to go back to Monson with her only 50 miles from the end. We were livid but when we arrived at the Lakeshore House Rebecca told us we were not going home and she went and raised enough money in 5 minutes to pay for a rental car, gave us a free meal, free room and board and free shuttle back to the trail. That person took a shower and hopped in the car and left the 3 of us without a word. This is why i never mentioned her name.

We had terrain ranging from 625ft to 964ft in the first 18 miles so we knew we could make great time. After about 2 miles we hit the mosquito Armada with 100's of mosquitos everywhere. If you stopped for any reason they were all over you. We hiked fast the first 4 miles to Antler Campsite where we had planned on camping during this hike but with all that went on we could not camp here. This place sits on a pristine lake with nice campsites and a nice clean privy. We had to move on so next we hiked around Jo Mary Lake and passed the beach we camped on in 2012. We then made our way to Potaywadjo Spring Lean-to for a snack. After 8 miles we were feeling good but the mosquitos were still bad. In the next 4 miles we around 550ft on pretty good terrain. The trail in the hundred miles has many mud bogs and huge roots to hike over and around. We then made our way to Nahmakanta Lake where in 2010 we met 3 old guys who were drunk but very friendly who we camped with bc we were low on food. They had 8 coolers so hey we had to stay back then or starve. One of the guys fixed us pork tenderloin and potatoes and they told us to eat anything we wanted while we camped with them. They were great guys and told us their wives told them if they kept the bills paid up they allowed them this friends week camping and fishing trip. We then had to make our way up to the top of Nesuntabunt Mountain at 1520ft, this was the last climb before Katahdin. We then descended down to 600ft before climbing back to 1020ft where we arrived at the shelter after 25.9 miles.

It rained the first 15 miles on us and the bushes were soaking us as bad as the rain. When we reached the ledges we seen a huge bull moose with a giant rack. After photos we continued on bc we were both starting to chill. We hiked 6 more miles to Abol Bridge and we seen Fresh Grounds set up under some tarps feeding hikers hot meals with hot chocolate. This definitely warmed us up for the last 9.9 into the park. We met teradactyl who said he had been following us on this journal sight, so that was neat. After eating 4 tacos,2 hot dogs, 3 plates of deep fried taters,2cokes and a warm hot chocolate we started our last 9.9 into Katahadin streams campground. Thank you Fresh Grounds for everything you do, it sure helped us get warm and also the rain stopped. The last 9 miles is in Baxter State Park with the first 3 or 4 completely flat. After that there was a sign with a blue blaze trail for high water route bc you have 2 fords but we stayed on the AT. While we were fording the second one up to our waist 3 of the group of ten young people had taken the blue blaze and stopped to take photos of us in the water. Found out only 1 of the ten stayed on the AT and forded like we did. We then basically ran to the check in and when we arrived we were number 5 and 6 and right behind us the group of 6 showed up to fill the 12 spots. We hiked 24.9 miles by 3 oclock. Good thing we did or we would have been begging to camp with someone who had paid for a spot. In the park there is no running water,no phone service,no drink machines,no snack machines. You get your water from the streams and eat what you carry into the park. This evening we sat around and talked about the trail and how glad it was almost over. We met a man and his grandson who were climbing Katahdin in the morning, they were from Knoxville and the man had been section hiking the AT since 1997 and tomorrow he finishes his hike.

The next 1.5 was rock steps,roots,grabbing to trees,boulder hopping and walking thru water coming off the mtn in the middle of the trail. When we arrived above treeline we had to put jackets on bc we had about a 20 to 40 mph wind gusts which made it chilly. It was a great day with some clouds and fog blowing in and out but every time it cleared out and you could see for miles in all directions. The next mile or so is grabbing onto metal bars,boulder climbing,shear rock climbing and scooting. It one giant obstacle course. We then reached the tablelands where we could see the sign but it waz still a long way off. The wind was whipping and it was still cool. Then we reached the last 800ft climb up to the top on rock steps with some boulder hopping. We arrived at 9 and told each other that seemed easy today.

The neat thing was we came around a corner and these bushes were moving around violently, we thought is was a bear or turkeys but after about 1 minute about 10 to 15 wild boars scattered so fast we didnt get a photo. It was still great to see where they tore up to forest bed looking for food. After reaching the bald we hiked 1.7 down to NC 1310 where we met Spirit. She has come up to slackpack us for a few days.

We climbed from 1700ft to 4710 at the top of swim bald in the first 6 miles. It was a great sunrise with many differant colors around 6:30.

As we came out of the woods a couple who are volunteering at Fontana Dam gave us two breakfast burritos and 2 apple pies. We started back out at 11:30 with no rain to this point, but it was all about to change. After about .5 heading towards Fontana it started raining and it rained hard 4 times in the next 7 miles lasting 20 to 30 minutes each time. The trail was a river as well. We climbed up Jacobs Ladder a steep portion of the trail before reaching Brown Fork Gap Shelter where we stopped and Ratman rung his shirt out to get the rain water out of his shirt. But it rained hard 2 more times after stopping to do that. We started hearing thunder to the West, but to the East nothing but sunshine. We started hiking faster because it didnt look good to the west of us. We stayed between 3000ft and 4000ft the next 12 miles before starting our 3 mile descent down to Fontana Lake. When we crossed the road into Fontana we had 1 more mile to the shelter where Spirit was waiting on us to arrived. When we got there she was grilling burgers and corn on the cob, we very much appreciated that bc we didnt stop once the rain started for water or food. We were going to stay at the shelter but a teenage kayak group had taken over the shelter so we decided to stay in a motel for the evening. We stopped at the visitors center to thank that couple again for lunch and then headed to the motel. We were pleased with 29 miles in 12 hrs with 8900ft of elevation.

We went up to Kincora and visited with Bob People's who is a legend on the AT and he recognized us and stated is this your 4th thru hike. We talked with him for an HR then went to town for Mexican. We then went back to Kincora to get some rest. We have 41.2 to go. GOD BLESS","

Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620013,"Today I hiked South and Marcia North. It was a 20.5 mile day, we were looking forward to this hike bc we were hiking around Watauga Lake with chances to see bears. Marcia started at 6 and I at 7. The first mile was flat then I climbed for 2 miles until I reached the Nick Grindstaff Memeroil. Then I mostly Ridgeline hiked with a few climbs. I reached the high point of Iron Mtn before descending to Turkey Gap. As we hike towards each other we let each other know every 30 minutes what mile point we are at so we know each is safe. After 9 miles I met Marcia for lunch. The weather was great even with a 50 percent chance of rain. After lunch I continued on and after 1 mile Marcia sent me a pic of a huge black and gold rattlesnake in front of her on the trail. Then 2 miles later I came across a bear. After more Ridgeline hiking I descended to the Watauga Lake Dam that you hike over then start the 2.7 mile hike around the lake. Marcia texted me that she had made it back after finishing the 20.5 miles by 1:30 and I texted her and told her I was .3 away. It was perfect timing to end a great day of hiking with no rain. We will take 2 days off and will hike the last 20.7 into Damascus on Friday so family can be there to celebrate this epic 4th thru hike of the iconic AT. We will be doing videos on the last day every 2hrs letting everyone know how close we are to finishing. GOD BLESS","

Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620058,"Today we are taking a zero with 20.7 to go to finish the trail. We will be doing laundry and just relaxing. We want to finish Friday so family can come and celebrate this 4th thru of the AT. We have NOBO 2 times and SOBO 1 time. This has been a neat way to do a thru hike and very different. We call it a wrap around by starting in Damascus, summiting Katahdin then wrap back to Springer before hiking back to Damascus. With 150 miles to at Sam's Gap Ratman developed a bad rash and since we were close to home we had family pick us up and we spent a few days at home recovering. We decided to use our car the last 150 miles and pass the keys like a father and son did in 2012. It's been fun but we don't like hiking alone. We did hike together some and hitched back to the car when we could. We will hike the last 21 miles together. GOD BLESS","

Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620348,"Today is the day we finish this AT journey. We were at the trailhead by 6:15 with the hopes of reaching Damascus by 2:30. We started by hiking thru a field for 1 mile with a very colorful sunrise to our right. We then entered the woods where we would remain except for two road crossings. In the first 6 miles we basically had small up and downs with great trail to hike on until reaching Low Gap. We then climbed up to McQueens Knob, we stayed between 3300ft and 4000ft. The trail was very easy and all the climbs and downs we're very well graded. After 10 miles we took a break to eat before starting our final 11 miles into Damascus. The weather was great except they were calling for 80 percent chance of rain. With about 5 miles to go a large dark cloud appeared with thunder but no rain. We picked up our pace and reached Damascus at 2 with Spirit,Haley and Tim and Robin Chapman waiting on us at the sign. We started March 20th under this sign and made it back today. The television station was there to meet us as well. This 4th thru hike has been an amazing hike and we want to thank everyone who followed us and supported us on this journey. GOD BLESS","

Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621809,"Today is our final entry on trailjournals. Most that follow us are very supportive and over 4 thru hikes we have hiked with 100's if not close to a thousand thru hikers. After our first we have had hikers try to get us to skip sections because they would say you already hiked it so you can skip it this time. But, as witnessed by everyone we have hiked with we hike every mile of trail. We journal for friends to follow but on this hike we have had many that all they wanted to do is write something bad. 99 percent of the hiking community is very supportive to all hikers like we are but since we have had so much negativity on trailjournals we will stop journaling and will set up a hiker site for friends to follow. The ones that write something and don't even leave a email so we can respond back, we ask why bother if you won't even leave a name. We thank everyone who has followed us and has supported us along the way, but we just want everyone to know this will be our last post. GOD BLESS and keep supporting the hiking community even if they hike 1 mile or 50000 miles because the hiking community that we know is like family.","

Honeymoon Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625704,"Its been awhile since we have done any blogging. We want to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and wish everyone happy and safe hiking. We are taking this year off from long distance hiking because since we started hiking in 2010 we have hiked every summer and just need a break. We also need to work and save up money for our next adventure. This year we are going to Alaska in July to visit Ratmans brother who is in the Air Force, proudly 27yrs. We will do some hiking while there, hopefully in Denali. Then in 2021 starting May 1 we will be hiking the West Highlands Way and other trails in Ireland. We will spend a month hiking there before returning for our big journey. Starting June 1 2021 we will be driving thru all 48 land locked states. We will camp in each one, hike at least 5 miles in each one, visit all national parks and collect all 48 Starbucks mugs from each state. The other thing is we have 12 more states highpoints to bag to complete all 50 states high points, so we will try to knock most of them off as well. Thank you to everyone who has followed us and supported us over the yrs. We are currently working on section hiking the AT with 500 miles completed so far as well.
