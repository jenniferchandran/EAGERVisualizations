Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597693,"I've carefully considered which trail to hike in 2019 and always seem to gravitate to the AT.  It's not as if the trail is the same, but the familiarity with certain features does seem inviting.  I'm sure the other long trails are beautiful, but they lack the culture of the AT, which is a big draw for me.  I love the scenery and the AT offers plenty of variety.  Hitching long distances and carrying buckets of water just doesn't.  So, here I am, preparing for a third thru hike of the AT.  Most of my gear is collected and I'm now in a process of shaking it down.  My goal is to post one entry a month in preparation, and one entry per day while on the trail.  Goals are just faint guidelines for a plan.  Do consider following along and I'll keep it positive, that's my promise to my readers.  Even when I'm sweaty and thirsty and tired and hungry.",,View Entry,"Jul 20, Fri",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598905,"Such a personal thing, this getting equipment prepared for a thru hike. No two people would agree on every detail, but I think experience shows when a person can step back from looking at someone else's gear list and be satisfied that letting them figure it out is better than dictating one's preferences. I have met and become solid friends with thru hikers that carried far more and far less gear than I. All of them expressed satisfaction with their chosen gear. Now me? I'm never satisfied, but some of the gear I carry has been with me through many miles either because it is durable or simply useful. 
I try to use lightweight gear. Admittedly I spend a lot of money on some of it. Most of the time, if you shop carefully, I think you get what you pay for. For my boots and tent, the two most important and expensive items I carry, I pay top dollar. I'm sure plenty of folks could register an argument for spending less, but that's just me. Beyond that, weight, utility, durability and possibility for double duty for a criteria for choosing what goes and what doesn't.
I use an excel spreadsheet with a winter and a summer page. The difference is obvious, but some gear actually does get switched out for a lighter version, such as the sleeping bag. This year I have finally jumped on the synthetic band wagon for my sleeping bag. The winter portion of 2015 from Springer to Damascus was wet and cold. I wasn't in danger of hypothermia, but it was a constant threat with a down bag supplemented by liners and kept dry through vigilance. Even the summer gear, however, is scrutinized. Weighed to the resolution of a gram and compared with other similar gear. Call me anal retentive, but I really like seeing the column of weight in grams and the column of converted ounces and pounds in side by side comparison.
Truth is, it provides a distraction during the long winter, while waiting for that March day, when boots on the ground out weigh all the preparation I can stir up.",,View Entry,"Jul 31, Tue",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599321,"Even when I carry a stove, I only cook one meal a day. Usually that's a package of Ramen or mashed potatoes. Maybe if I'm splurging this resupply, I'll whip up a package of stove top stuffing. None of which provides a decent amount of calories. OK, the stuffing comes close. The stove takes up room in the pack, requires a new canister from time to time and honestly, I just found I could do without it.If you think about it, the simplicity of thru hiking lends itself to doing without the creature comforts of home. I do without coffee, oatmeal and macaroni, why not Ramen and mashed potatoes. Now, I change my mind from time to time, so I will likely put it in my bounce box, so I'll only have to do without that stuffing mix for a couple hundred miles or so. In a few weeks, I'll head out with my winter gear kit (only because it's a shakedown) and test this stoveless setup once again. Who knows, maybe I'll change my mind back. One thing I'm certain about though. If I don't have it, I don't have to carry it. Some would argue that I still have to carry the weight of the stove in extra food, but that's not the whole story. All I need to do is carry an equal amount of calories to the cooked food to realize the weight savings. Divide the weight of the stove by four (the typical resupply) and I can break even with that much more cheese or whatever. That's my plan anyway.",,View Entry,"Aug 04, Sat",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602334,"Shakedown is a term used to describe the various testing of equipment, body, food and mental preparation.  Doesn't have to be strenuous like the AT, unless physical stamina is something you want to test.  In this case, I had several pieces of new gear that I wanted to put under scrutiny.  Primarily, my single person Nemo tent, Nemo Sleeping pad and a new Marmot 20°synthetic sleeping bag.  I needed a good storm and it seemed late August was a good time to find one.  My friend Drop Bear invited me to hike a portion of the Northville-Placid trail in the Adirondack region of New York state.  We did a five day, fifty mile section using both shelters and tenting along the way.By Wednesday night we set our sights to camp at the base of the highest climb on the trail, which was just over 1000 ft.  It was a beautiful day, although we did note some heavy breezes passing through the treetops at mid day.  Somewhere between 4 and 5 PM the storm moved in and we found ourselves hiking in a pouring rain.  Well, that's not so bad.  We had both been in pouring rain before.  We arrived at the campsite with the rain still coming down.  As quickly and efficiently as we could we set up the tents, helping each other by letting the owner of each tent take the lead and simply pointing out what we needed the other to do next.  The rain continued as we set up our two small one person tents in a space that really wasn't large enough for both.  I compromised by not staking out my vestibule to the full size.Of course, the rain stopped within 20 minutes of our setup, but we had no way to determine that.  Thankfully, we were able to minimize the wet and managed to keep most of the tent interiors dry.  My synthetic bag really did well, since it was impossible to keep every inch of the tent floor dry.  It got a little damp, but not so much as to soak up a lot of heavy water.  That night the storm came in hard with two separate events.  The small one person tent wasn't as bad as I thought it might be.  A bit tighter than my usual 2P tents of the past, but still plenty of room.  I stayed dry through the night.I'm very happy with the tent, a Nemo Hornet 1P Elite.  Pricey, but very functional.  The Marmot Ultra Elite 20 synthetic bag, with an EN rating of 22.5° F weighing in at 2.2 lb did very well, even in the 70°F temperatures of the hike.  Got a little damp, but dried out quickly.  As my first synthetic bag, I'm sold.  The Nemo 20 inch wide sleeping pad didn't do so well.  Like most air pads, it made a lot of noise in the shelter.  I found that by not blowing it up tight it was a little quieter.  Still, the 20 inch width just doesn't cut it.  Exped make a 25 inch wide mummy shaped pad, but the longitudinal baffles can't endure the rigors of the AT, as I found out in 2016. Conclusion: The tent will make the whole trip. Sleeping bag will go until I change to summer gear.  The pad goes on the scrap heap, in search of the perfect pad for these old bones.  Is it out there?",,View Entry,"Sep 06, Thu",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605270,"OK, I know, it looks like I abandoned it. My preparations this year have taken a different approach than in years past and it might be a stretch to consider my recent excursions preparation for the trail. Actually I was just enjoying a solo photography trip near the AT.
My previous hikes through the Roan Highlands have occurred in the springtime, so I decided to visit the area in the Fall and try to catch the brief period of near peak and peak fall foliage. This included several day trips on short sections. No big miles because my camera gear alone weighs more than my base pack. I could do it, but I wouldn't enjoy it. Meanwhile here is a picture taken from the AT in TN in the Fall.
I've decided to move my start date to some time around the first of March. I'll get myself in the vicinity and see if I can manage to find a minimum in the traffic, not that it is a huge concern, but why not try.
A shout out to my friends and super trail angels Jimmy and ""I Believe"" Spillman, who connected with me this past weekend. Always nice to hear from people I've met along the trail. Asked some very good questions that I've been thinking about all along. How do I fit in all the great people and places to visit. My understanding is that hostels are becoming more available along the trail, which might be something to consider that modifies the route of GA-ME16.
Hey, sometimes I will refer to GA-TN15, when I left the trail in 2015 at Damascus because I met some excellent folk out there, who I keep in contact with.

I really don't know how this will pan out, but I wanted to spice it up just a little this year by sticking to a familiar format. Part of that is getting that in-line HTML picture adding down along with a bit of standard format of things I want to record along the trail. Maybe depart just a little from doing an end of the day data dump of just whatever rolls off my cold fingers in a tiny tent. I think the pictures may add to the flavor, if I can just manage to upload them out on the trail. Depends on the signal strength, I suppose.

Anyway, here is an image I captured on my Fall trip down to TN/NC along the AT.  Probably not a sight you would actually see as a Nobo, but my Sobo friends might see something like this.

Highlight of the Day
We've been through some pretty cold and snowy conditions here in Michigan, but it seems it's much broader than that.  I see below zero temps in Indiana, which is somewhat rare.
Outlook for Tomorrow
Cold weather remains. I'm gonna stay inside, unless someone asks if I want to go snowshoeing. Actually at this posting we were in a cold spell replacing records two decades old.

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606937,"Cold Weather
We've been having some might cold nights here in Michigan. Last night was such a night, so I decided to test some gear. Particularly my Marmot 20°sleeping bag and Sea to Summit sleeping pad. The lowest point of temperature I noted on the weather app I use was 12°F. Now... I didn't know exactly what actual comfort range my bag on my pad and inside my tent might support. The temperature on the bag states 22.5° F European rating for men. The European rating is fast becoming the standard, since none exist in the US. Duly noted I was working with a 10° deficit. I did not use my Cocoon silk liner (because I accidentally left it in the house), but I did have my light 800 fill down jacket.
Extreme Conditions
At approximately 8:00 PM I crawled into my tent presumably for the night. Temperature reading 20° on my phone. Ultra tiny tent by the way. I think most people would consider it too small, but it's big enough for me to do necessary evening activities, store my gear and seal myself off from the weather and insects. Things went alright for the first several hours, before I unpacked my down jacket and put it on inside my sleeping bag. At least the bag allows this much range of motion, which I consider a plus. I also pulled the draw string tight, leaving only a breathing hole. The temperature continued to fall.

Backyard Gear test
Things Get Dicey
At midnight, it was starting to get pretty cold. A subjective observation to be sure, but the meaning was clear enough. I was still fairly comfortable, but the cold had started to seep in. By 2:00 AM the temperature was bottomed out at 12°F and I wasn't sleeping. I weighted the options and pulled the plug on my test. It would be another six hours before daylight, I was essentially half way through the night. Too cold to continue. I was thinking to myself I could have survived it... but why?
Concessions
Out on the AT in March the temperatures can drop into the sub 20 range. I've experienced below 20°F weather on every occasion that I have hiked the AT in March. Not every day, but enough to warrant planning ahead. My pack weight has been whittled down to bare minimums, foregoing a couple items of cold weather gear, such as my Sea to Summit Theromolite Reactor Extreme. It weighs a pound, and I was hoping not to carry it this year. Supposedly it adds up to 25°F of warmth. Guess what, it's going back in the pack. Nothing beats a cold night for testing the limits of my gear. Laugh with me. I'm glad I did the test and decided to go with comfort. My pack is still on the light side at 15.5 lbs base weight, but I think I'm gonna sleep much better on those unpredictable cold nights. I use the silk cocoon as a sort of buffer at the top of my bag and the liner for added insulation.
Conclusions
I've been focused on weight, because I know how difficult it gets to carry a pack up and down mountains for days at a time. A little dose of reality doesn't hurt when you're planning for a thru hike. I really needed a wakeup call on just how efficient was my sleeping system. Just needed to wait for the right moment.",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Sun",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607265,"The Unexpected
Last week I was doing some follow up
gear checks and trying to get in a little hill climbing. The weather
report indicated rain in southern Indiana, so I didn't pay a lot of
attention to it. I've been rained on before. Well, to make a long
story short, I ended up stranded in rising flood waters and had to
leave my vehicle and spend the night on higher ground.
A Decision to Stay Put
I contacted the State Forest Ranger
Station left a message in case they found my truck. Then I prepared
to spend the night on the hill. Ranger Derrick later informed me
there was a high wind warning with gusts to 45 mph. He offered to
pick me up at the other end of the lake if I wanted to hike out, but
I didn't want to get that far away from my truck if the water
receded.
Hunker Down
I entered my tent at 4:00 pm, early as
it may seem, but I rarely build a fire. Getting warm was my first
priority. I checked in with my wife and some friends, checked the
weather reports and confirmed the high wind warnings. The wind
advisory had come in since my last check. I had not waited for that
confirmation. I set my tent up in the lee of a stout tree. The wind
whipping around the tree divided and faced a tight wind break formed
by the back corner of my rain fly. I chose the base tree because it
was standing on flat ground and seemed to have a strong root base. I
also checked to make sure there were no widow-makers above this spot.
A Long Night
I suppose it was a little crazy to stay
out there, but now, I'm training and gear testing for the AT. Might
as well have it real. Except for the truck trapped in flood part. Of
course. The night was long, the winds blew constantly, and
occasionally a gust would roar thru the dip in the ridge a hundred
yards away. Two falling trees, with their screeching limbs, broke the
sound of the wind, before crashing like thunder to the ground.
Interesting night.
Elusive Comfort
Temperatures fell to 25°F, a suitable
test for my reexamined sleeping gear. I had added both liners along
with a thicker, but lighter air pad. Since that night, I have added a
space blanket under my air pad, shiny side up to assist on very cold
nights, recommended by my friend Drop Bear, from Victoria, Australia.
Through the winter I have picked over the equipment in my kit for
weight. An optimized pack might still contain a little comfort. No
need to suffer out there, I would rather enjoy it.

Adding heat conservation layer.
Oh Yeah, the Truck
Well, the truck is fine. The water
receded during the night and didn't get higher than the tires. I
slept in a little, to balance the lack of sleep. In addition to the
trees falling, about a dozen of those 45 mph freight train like wind
gusts swept through until about 4:00 AM. I eventually left my
sleeping bag, put on frozen boots and checked on my truck.
Onward
Ya, I really pulled a greenhorn move
getting my truck stranded, but I have been fording that stream since
I was a toddler. I've never witnessed that bottom land flood before.
I made the best of it and put my gear through a stress test under
harsh conditions. Glad I did. I took time to consider the tent
location for sheltering in a saturated forest under high wind
advisory. My technique may provide an edge and will become a standard
practice when similar conditions arise. Nobody wants to get clobbered
by a tree. Let me leave you with something I saw along the trail that day that represents the beauty of the forest to me.

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607661,"I was first to arrive at the Springer mountain camp site, although I met a dozen people on the trail from Amicalola today. I suppose some of the faster ones moved on to Stover Creek four miles up.
It was a clear crisp day, with patches of ribbon frost pushing up here and there. The sky was vivid blue and gave a contrast to the dormant trees. To the casual observer the forest may look lifeless. After all it is still wintertime here.
I'm wrapped in my bag before sunset. And will be here for more than twelve hours. I really dont mind. Tomorrow after the sun provides a little warmth, I'll begin logging miles. The eight point sumthin I did today were simply the approach trail. Still I'm calling this a trail day, just not counting the miles. There are plenty of those miles along the trail.

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607895,"Another beautiful day,  perfect weather for a hike, but it was bitter cold when I first awoke this morning. I waited till it warmed up a little and was alone at Springer by the time I left my tent.
About 30 people here tonight, pretty typical for Hawk Mountain. Quite a mix of section hikers and prospective thru hikers. Nice crowd, I'm sure the conversation will continue into the night. That's not a bad thing. There is a small fire going, so folks are standing around and getting to know one another.
For some reason, I cant eat the food I brought. Just not hungry, so I forced down a tuna packet and ate a few bites of cheese. Guess I'll just carry it until I eat it all.
Weather may move in. Rain could put quite a damper on things. I'll try for a spot in the shelter tomorrow night. Not my favorite place to sleep, but better than a wet tent. I'm tired after the hike today, although it was wonderfully mild and the sun was shining.  We'll see what tomorrow brings.","Springer Mountain

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607896,"The true highlight of any day or night, for me, is the sound of birds, and the Georgia woods do not disappoint. My favorites,  the owls have made their presence known every night. Both Great Horned and Barred owls call at night, if only for a few moments. Always a treat.
After spending last night in the shelter at Hawk Mountain, I did my usual leisurely start. The rain began as I started the days hike making for some slippery and muddy conditions. The temperature was slightly higher,  which made for a nice hike even though I had layers on, including my Marmot rain jacket. It's hard to stay dry in the jacket while hiking because it doesn't breath very well. Just a trade off, because it is a pretty light and versatile item.
Sassafras Mountain was the big deal today. This being my fourth time over it, I didn't think it was particularly difficult. Maybe because I know what lies ahead, or just that I'm not intimidated by folks trying to talk it up. Actually,  the more difficult part of the day was not slipping and falling. Did I mention the mud?
Here at Gooch, the shelter was naturally full by the time I arrived, but I knew it would be,so it wasn't a downer. The Georgia folk have added several tent pads. Good for them for trying to accommodate the hikers. They also added bear boxes to Hawk and Gooch shelters. The changes seem abundant, but the AT still has its way. I set up my tent in the rain and here I'll stay until it let's up tomorrow morning. 
Really now, I  welcome these long stints in my tent. Much needed rest and muscle rebuilding occurs, so for me it's part of my plan. Built right in. Plenty of time for socializing when the weather is pleasant and people are dry. Right now, my body needs time to recoup. The short eight mile days help.

We will climb Blood Mountain tomorrow, which isn't all that bad, but then we get to descend into Neels Gap. A cabin awaits, I reserved it ahead of time, but first I'll have to get down the slippery granite of Blood Mountain.  The wet makes it difficult.
No owls tonight yet, but I'm not near a shelter. I think they stick around shelters because the food supply (rodents) is plentiful, but that's just a guess.
Feeling pretty good for the start. One knee sorta 1 on the pain scale, so I'll just take it easy and hopefully won't have to nurse it all the way to Katahdin.

Zero days count for a lot toward building the legs for the long haul. It may seem funny that I hike so few hours and just rest most of the time. If you think about it though, my handy dandy phone step counter measures over 20,000 steps for each 8 mile hiking day, and I can say with confidence a lot of those steps are at an aerobic pace. It's a serious cardio workout, humping a pack over these mountains.

So tomorrow it's a longer day with eleven miles out to Low Gap. The next four days will finish up GA.

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608273,"The owls serenaded us again last night. Possibly a territorial dispute because a great horned owl ended up being shouted down by three barred owls. Quite the raucous. 
The day was cool and clear, which made for good hiking. Nice weather for a long 12 plus. The rocky trails have begun. The rocks take their toll on tired feet. I stopped midday and put some body glide on my feet. Immediate relief from the burning feeling,  but still twelve miles makes them hurt a little. That's why I try to keep the early days short and build up some endurance.
Last night Pilgrim and I took a short walk to see the lights of Hiawassee from the ridgeline near Muskrat Creek. It was a little bushy, but still an inspiring sight to see where we had been just the day before.
Last night was in the 20s and tonight's outlook is to be cold as well. Still better than last time here at Carter Gap. We awoke to snow that time in 2016. The very clear sky tonight promises a drop on temp as soon as the sun sets. I think I will use the hand warmer pad I've been saving for a cold night.
I enjoyed a fine dinner of Tuna in a tortilla, Mozzarella cheese and Wheat Thins. Same as last night. And tomorrow night. I might change cheese in Franklin,  but that's two days away.","Muskrat Creek

Pretty much the same group of folks for the last three days. Mainly because the shelters are spaced out nicely. Roughly twelve mile days, to gain a 4 mile nero into Winding Stair gap tomorrow morning for the shuttle into Franklin.
Three beautiful clear days in a row. Chilly, but great for hiking. Sure no complaints here. I am tired tonight though, so I'll make this entry short.
I did want to add that it is so nice to hear from everyone via the guestbook. I'm not journaling to gain a large readership, but it's nice to know people do actually read it. This first part of the journey before the smokies is the hardest part for me,as I am sure it is for others.

While we were standing around waiting at Winding Stair gap, I spied a solo shuttle driver hoping to catch some hikers and for a couple extra bucks Pilgrim and I beat the crowd to Baltimore Jack's place and Mr Ron Haven, himself booked us into a great room, an apartment really for today and tomorrow. Ron Haven is Mr Franklin for the AT hiker community. Good people in my book. We were in the room and showered by 10:00 AM.
To my delight the barred owls goaded us along as we packed up frozen gear. I listened to them for a few moments before getting up the courage to tug the zipper of my sleeping bag open. The birds remind me why I love this journey. The getting out of my bag... not so much. <grin>
Food, drink and an outfitter to replace my Marmot 20° bag with a real sleeping bag. 20° bah! More like 35° after the synthetic gets compressed. The last three nights were not comfortable at all. Even with two liners. The Marrmot is headed home tomorrow. Another casualty of the trail.","Rock Gap

We have traveled one hundred plus miles on foot, carrying our temporary home, our necessary belongings, our hopes and dreams of hiking the famous Appalachian Trail. We have carried each other and felt the burden of those who had to leave the trail and those to whom we have said a temporary goodbye with hopes of crossing paths at some future mile of the journey. Let me put to rest any rumors that Conductor has left the trail. Far from it; I'm stronger than ever, determined as ever and excited about the coming milder weather.
Winter has tested us, soaked us, chilled us, but our determination to complete this journey has grown stronger with each trial. The forest is slowly waking up. Here in the valley, the fields around Franklin are green and showing signs of spring and right on time with the Vernal Equinox occurring today. Tomorrow,  the days will be longer than the nights. 


Albert Mountain Tower, from the Trail 
Looking Forward 
In five days we will be at the threshold of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. Between here and there lie some rather impressive climbs and descents. Our legs and lungs have already begun to change into hiker tough bodies and soon we will have our trail legs, which is shorthand for excellent physique. My personal gage is when I can carry my pack up a 500 ft climb without opening my mouth to breath. At the top I will shout out with everything I've got. The woods will simply sigh back. The trees know this happiness I speak of. They live here.

Spring Blossoms
Looking Inward
Having hiked the trail before is a double edged sword. I want to help those who are struggling, offer quidance where some have misinformation, give advice that will help aspiring thru hikers along.
 The price for that, of course, is being that tedious fellow, who thinks he knows everything about the trail. I try to balance that out by not announcing my past journeys to every new acquaintance. If asked, I lay it out in simple terms, making sure to mention the time I left the trail in Damascus with sore feet and defeated mindset. Still, I can't help but offer a bit of advice when I think it will improve the experience for someone. 
Looking Breathlessly
I have the help of my personal Star Trek tricoder phone complete with apps that help me identify plants and birds. Mushrooms and reptiles will soon be added to our experience. The wildflowers and trees will be blooming. Looking forward to mountain sides full of Laurel and Azalea. More than the mind can imagine. My thoughts often wanders to the descent from the GSMNP into Davenport Gap, where the Trilliums will greet us with a variety of colorful blossoms.
So, today is a restful and relaxing day preparing for the push towards the great park, where our winter gear will be tested once again. Through the Nantahala River gorge and onward towards Fontana Dam, the gateway to the ""Smokies"" where we will traverse the entire length of the GSMNP.","Winding Stair Gap

About the time I got to the tower on Wayah Bald a cold front had moved in and back on came the jackets and gloves. Swiss Miss and Firefly were at the tower at the same time so we took advantage of the photo opportunity. I met Swiss Miss on the approach trail and Firefly on day 1. They are traveling together as a team, like Pilgrim and myself. Unfortunately, the cold made it somewhat uncomfortable at the tower, so everyone moved on without the normal lingering at such a magnificent view.
Less than a mile away, I made it to the shelter and set up my tent during some kind d of snow cone drill. Bigger and heavier than snowflakes, smaller than hail. The fellows in the shelter had a word for it, but I forget what it was. It covered  my ground cloth before i could get my tent set up.
I hastily ate my evening meal, while shivering in the shelter and entered my tent for the night at around 4:30. And, here I am writing to you fine people. 
It was a nice day for most of it. Guess I'll test my new bag tonight. Supposed to get cold again.","Winding Stair Gap

I wolfed down a Boston Creme Chocolate honey bun in the now empty shelter. Nothing to wash it down, but it was good anyway.
The first part of the hike was snowy and cold. I wore my yaktrax just because. Probably could have done without them. The afternoon warmed up a little and the snow on the  south facing slopes melted away. It was a layers off, layers on kind of day. With the cold I'm a little sore tonight.
Probably a short day tomorrow. The NOC is full because it's a weekend. So we'll stop short at the Rufus Morgan shelter.","Wayah Shelter

This morning the hike was spectacular! I had forgotten how steep the terrain was. It descended the mountain in a series of steep switchbacks. The blue sky really made a nice backdrop and by the time we arrived at our camp, the Rufus Morgan shelter it was warm and sunny. Along the route down was a place called the jump off. (Pictured)

Before long we were on our way out of the gorge and starting the 4000 foot climb up and over Cheoah bald. Great view from the ""jump up"" back down towards the NOC now far below us. It's difficult to describe the view across the gorge to where we stood just yesterday. The distant mountains fade away into the distance in multiple shades of blue and gray. 
After the all day climb, we headed two and a half more miles down the steep northern slope of the mountain headed for Locust cove gap. Probably not the best idea.
When we finally arrived at the gap tent sites were scarce. Not just our smallish Thru Hiker bubble, but an entire scout troop. As I said, tent sites were scarce and my tiny patch of ground is anything but level. It is what it is. No way to tell what the days end will bring.","Rufus Morgan Shelter

Showered, fed and laundered before 1 PM, and having a nice break in the Fontana lodge before we enter the GSMNP tomorrow. 
Last night after we made camp some fast hikers moved in. The discussion turned to people who have hiked the AT and other trails in record breaking times. I have to ask... why?? Why would anyone want to just rush through a hike like this? I mean I miss my family and friends, and I would love to have the stamina to do 30 miles days, but it just seems to me an odd way to enjoy this experience. Hey, different strokes I guess. Takes a village and all that. But let me turn to a positive note. The days ahead look like some pretty nice weather, and it's far more than this hiker could hope for. I've seen some pretty severe weather in those high mountains and the thought of good weather for the days ahead really sounds great! Might even be able for the first time in four to actually have a view from Clingman's dome! Is that too much to hope for? Not for me.

Last night I tried my best to fall asleep in the shelter, but at midnight I gave up and set up my tent. We were two people beyond the 12 that the shelter supposedly sleeps so it was pretty crowded. I got up and did my best to quietly slip out and set up. Then fell asleep instantly in my tent.

We put together a nice campfire and everyone enjoyed the quiet atmosphere that stood in contrast to the boisterous party atmosphere the night before.

The wind that had been blowing hard all night couldn't pierce the dense forest. I was reminded of a similar hike on the same trail in 2015, as Papa Al and I tried to catch a sunrise. 
The winds whipped around the dome with a bitter cold and we found Snap and Mickey already there, along with a couple of weekend hikers huddled in their sleeping bags. The sun barely peeked thru, but it was satisfying to finally see it on my fourth time at the dome.
We pushed on and eventually made it to Newfound Gap, where seven of us, and one service dog, piled into a shuttle van who finally delivered us to a very crowded Gatlinburg. 
Resupply was sketchy within walking distance. The Old Dad's general store used to have a decent amount of hiker food, but not anymore. We supplemented our meager findings at the Walgreens down the street. Gatlinburg turned out to be a very poor option, but the alternative would be crossing the entire park, with less than desirable stops coupled with some long mile days. I'm sure there is a better way to get past the Smokies. I just haven't figured it out. Two more nights, with three days of hiking will put that chapter behind us. That's all I have to say about that.

I have crossed the Roan Highlands in both freezing horizontal rain as well as clear sunny skies. Wondering what the coming week will bring, I would prefer the latter.

Few of Us consider the absolute requirement for wet weather to keep this forest in balance. A more natural part to this landscape than humankind, let alone hikers, who follow a narrow path. The rain is vital. It's also vital for a hiker to avoid staying wet after the hiking is done. Sounds a little too simple doesn't it. We simply need to deal with it. That's all.
One of Us walks the path I take. Not my first thru hike. Not the first time I have taken an unplanned zero in Erwin because of thunderstorms. In a little more than a week I will push past Damascus on into the longest state on the trail, Virginia. Past four, five, six hundred miles, but for now 344.2 will do. Meanwhile, I look forward to the effect this warm rain will have on the forest.","Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610822,"I started the twelve mile hike today at 10:00, after waiting for the sky to start clearing up. Although it was generally up hill, the hike didn't seem all that bad. Pilgrim started at first light and was already in his tent when I arrived at 15:30 at the small campsite just beyond the Beauty spot clearing.
What a difference a chill wind makes. At 19:30 I headed back up to the clearing, but 20 mph winds make 50 feel mighty brisk. The sky is almost completely clear. Not a lot to light up a sunset. We tried. Looks like we may be in for a cold night. One of these will be our last cold night. Seems late this year.","Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610821,"I slept in today and then fell back asleep, waking up at 10:00. Didn't mean to do that and I didn't anticipate the difficulty of the day and came rolling into camp around 18:30. I didn't speak to or see another human all day until about a mile from the shelter. Wednesday and Bearfoot, two ladies I met a few days ago, had set up camp about a mile early.
We came over Unaka mountain today. The mature pine forest on top of the mountain is it's own ecosystem that I think must be a result of the mountain being isolated somewhat. Its beautiful regardless.
I saw a pileated woodpecker today. Heard them peck and laugh at us almost daily. The secretive bird seems to know when its been spotted. As I write, a barred owl is calling from the woods above the shelter.
I must admit, it was a difficult day. Tomorrow is longer, but hopefully not as difficult. Roan high knob, our next big mountain.","Beauty Spot Gap

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610823,"The long climb up the ridgeline and eventually Roan Mountain was nice to have early in the day. I waited for Pilgrim at the summit and we both made the side trail, water bags in tow, to check out the Roan High Knob shelter. Highest shelter on the AT at 6186 feet. I think it's fair to say, it was quite a climb. Some really beautiful views from the balds that followed and just a bit of scrambling. 
So here we are at Stan Murray, two miles short of the side trail to Over Mountain. When we arrived, there was a family and three large poodle mix dogs occupying the shelter, complete with a full size dome tent set up on the shelter. Funny.
The dogs should warn us of any bear encroachment. The certainly notify everyone if a hiker comes down the trail. Pilgrim and I sat at the table and cooked our evening meal, chatted with the family and moved off to the comfort of our tents.
Tomorrow some even higher balds and a long descent into Tennessee.","Clyde Smith Shelter

During the long descent into US19E and Mountain Harbour hostel my knees ached from overuse and the constant pounding over rocky trail.
I feel fortunate though. Within hours of arriving my knees had recovered. That includes up and down steps and ladders throughout the stay. Who doesn't love a converted barn in a rustic setting including a wood stove in the main lounge. And do not miss this breakfast!","Stan Murray Shelter

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610921,"Well, the thunderstorms came and dumped a significant amount of water into the drainage next to the hostel.  As the day and the rain moved into afternoon it became evident the stream was going to flood.
As flooding goes, the situation continued to worsen. Dave the owner was out on his tractor trying to shore things up. The volume of water continued to increase.
Pilgrim had been watching the water rise and that Dave was being overcome. He headed out and started working on the diversion dam that Dave was building with his front end loader tractor. Others followed and we managed to keep the water at bay.
It's dark now, but the rain continues. Hopefully the two diversion dams we build will keep the creek out of the basement, where the hostel has taken in the would be tenters because of the harsh conditions.","Mountain Harbour hostel

The weather report didn't look good, but we had stayed too long and the move forward urge found Pilgrim and I headed out into the rain at about 9:30. After one more Mountain Harbour B&B breakfast. Of course.
The elevation gain isn't as dramatic through here, but the peacefulness of the pastures and hollows makes it a great hike rain or shine. We stopped by Jones falls, which was flowing heavily and Mountaineer falls, also flowing heavily. The the light off and on rain started around the time we made it to the Mountaineers shelter. We decided to make camp. Actually, we set up our tents and called it a night.","Mountain Harbour hostel

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611134,"A chilly day, mostly dense clouds with a brief clearing about the time we reached Dennis Cove road and turned right towards Black Bear resort. The trail was a little less demanding in terms of altitude gain and loss.
Right knee was bothering me quite a bit today. I'm apprehensive about it because its 50 miles to Damascus, where I might be able to find a brace or something that will help. Until then I'll be in some pain. 
We were able to dry our tents out once we got settled. That's always a good thing. Last night was rainy off and on all night. Today wasn't wet, but it wasn't a good day for drying tents along the trail either.
Black Bear resort, under new ownership, but essentially the same. Rented the same cabin I stayed in in 2016, and to my surprise it was on the same day 21 April. Ate a whole pizza and downed two Yuenglings. Then just tried to relax and stay off the leg.","Mountaineers Shelter

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611177,"Although I got a good nights sleep, I was worried about the knee. As I began hiking through Laurel Canyon and crossing the stream three times on beautifully constructed bridges, I remembered once again why the AT is so special to me. I even saw a red eft, my first this year.
Hiking on and climbing up and over Pond Mountain, it became evident that I was not going to be able to hike to Damascus on this knee without some sort of support and rest. I made the decision to stop at Boots Off hostel and get a ride into Elisabethton to a mainstream drugstore. 
I ended up going with the hostel owner on his general errand run and found the KT Tape I needed. Great hostel by the way, and the best thing about it... a solid cell phone signal.
Sat around the campfire talking with folks tonight. Section hikers and Thru hikers alike. So a rather painful day ended nicely by a campfire. 
KT Tape is awesome stuff and I can already walk without a limp, but I'm going to give it one more day of rest before we push on to Damascus. Sorry AT... you don't get rid of me that easy.","Black Bear Resort

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611281,"Ok, so I hung around the Boots Off hostel for another zero day. My goal was simply to rest the knee and see if I could walk without a limp before heading toward Damascus. Everything seems Ok. The tape seems to be working. I'll carry the heavy knee stabilizer just in case until all knee problems are solved.
A bear came into the grounds last night setting  off the dogs. Yep, it's bear country folks. At least for the next several hundred miles. I guess it's ti.e to take a few more precautions with our food. A human food habituated bear can be a major problem. Its unfortunate for the bear and often ends with a euthanized bear. 
Tomorrow we traverse a section that is closed to all but hiking through it. It's a section around Watauga lake that has had some bad bear activity in past years.
Hey, its not all gloom and doom. We are about to make it to Virginia! Another state behind us, but that's two and a half days away. Hopefully nothing will delay our progress in getting past Damascus, another great trail town.","Boots Off Hostel. Hampton TN

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611381,"Left Boots Off hostel at my routine 0900 for the 16 mile trek to Iron Mountain shelter. It was a warm sunny day and I caught up with Pilgrim, who leaves earlier at Vandenvetnter shelter nine miles into the hike. We went just a little past the shelter in order to find flatter ground and have a nice stealth camp that is quiet and flat.
We passed through the bear closure area first thing this morning, but I think it's safe to say that we are in bear country now and need to take more precautions and be more vigilant. 
Finally met up with ""Onward"" today, who I knew from my 2015 hike and a hiker reunion I attended in Maine. Always good to see an old friend on the trail. She is with the Warrior Hike group this year. I can't do it justice so if you're interested just Google Warrior Hike and get the full scoop. Onward was a US Navy nurse, and you should know I love Navy folk.
Great views of Watauga lake from the ridgeline today. The valleys are various shades of green  and the farms look so peaceful from our high viewpoint.
The knee is doing fine. Manageable pain, not completely gone, but far better than two days ago. On the down side... my Snickers bar melted. Guess it's time to switch to Paydays.","Boots Off Hostel. Hampton TN

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611453,"Without any doubt, the trail magic at US-421 today was at a perfect time and place. I don't know why, but I was just having one of those low energy days. My thoughts were cluttered with things I didn't want to dwell on. And people were passing me all day, which kind of just gets to you after a while. 
Two burgers, two egg rolls and two beers later, I was plowing up the next hill like it was morning. Got to chat with some of the new bubble folks and that's always good. Even met a fellow trail journalist ""Looper"", who addressed me by name as soon as I walked up. He was part of the group of folks doing the trail magic. What a lift to the spirits.
The rain that was supposed to catch us midday didn't come in, so we stayed dry all day, but it's supposed to hit us tonight. Don't care. One, I'm in my tent. Two, we are only nine miles from Damascus! Tomorrow is ""Town Day."" Good food, post office, a shower and resupply. Not necessarily in that order. The shower should probably come first.
The picture isn't clear, but it's a monument placed by a hermit's family. Nick Grindstaff born 1851, died 1926, lived alone up in these woods. The epitaph reads...""Lived alone, suffered alone, died alone."" These mountains have a lot of stories to tell.","Iron Mountain

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611587,"The 05:30 alarm came at a time when the rain was pouring down, so I rolled over and snoozed, but true to my word I was packed and ready by 07:00 and on trail a full two hours earlier than normal. We crossed into Virginia and made it to Damascus by 10:00. Not a bad speed for nine miles, but when its pouring down rain, one seems to hike faster.
Visited post office, dinner and outfitter between rain showers that came in 20 minute waves all day. Actually only got caught in one downpour, but had to hurry a couple times.
Staying at Woodchuck hostel, which is a disappointment. The ownership changed hands and a great many changes were made. To be honest, I think the new owner should change the name and earn the reputation. But that's just me. I'll say no more.
Resupplied for a four day trip to Marion rather than three to cut back the miles for a few days and let the knee fully recover. Don't want to take another zero day. We did a 9 in and will do 7 out tomorrow. That will give us a little more time in town.

Saunders shelter is somewhat less popular than the Lost Mountain shelter 6 miles further, so there are multiple reasons to stop here. Our friends Go Fourth and March Fourth are here and one other tent up the hill a ways. 
Nice cool sunny day for walking, but I'm still being careful with the knee. Seriously though, carrying a full resupply of food is part of the issue. Fortunately, we get over it in a few days...wash rinse repeat ;-)

Pilgrim had made one of his excellent campfires and March Fourth, Tune-up (pictured) and I stood around it talking late into the night. I was feeling good and slept into the morning long enough for my tent to dry from the light rain we recieved after midnight.
During the hike this day, those nagging thoughts crept back in. I had been reading some emails from a night sky photography group I follow as well as those from the FAA drone notices. My two year drone license sits dormant at home. Many landscapes wait, while my camera sits idle at home as well. Spring is finally emerging at home and things that I love to do in the summer with my close friends. Yes folks, even 64 year old hiker dudes get homesick once in a while.
Meanwhile, my legs just didn't feel like hiking, yet we climbed over 2000 feet in the course of the day. By the time I was half way up Whitetop, my legs were exhausted. Probably more psychological than physical. Pilgrim was waiting for me at the chosen campsite just past the road. It was difficult, but I had to tell him what I had decided when I spoke to Beth half way up the mountain.
The view from Buzzard rock was spectacular and a fitting end, as I remembered my daughter Jennifer and at this very spot ten years ago. Never quit on a bad day... words of wisdom on the wall at Top of Georgia hostel. Well, it was a good day, cept for the sore legs.I had hiked 500 miles, including the eight mile approach trail from Amicalola Falls.
