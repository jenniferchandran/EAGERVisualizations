Subway Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606610,"I am not sure if first entry was saved.I can't find it. But briefly. A 1984 car pool partner told me about backpacking. I joined Sierra Club and ATC. Did lots of car camping. When retired from Navy and Marines in 1999  I took my wife,12,11,3 year old kids bike camping newly mapped continental divide  Montana area all July. We all wrote journals. My 11 year old daughter wrote a week before...""I can't believe my parents are really doing this stupid trip..""...but she did great and as college student did some of AT! Then we car camped Glacier area August before moving to Tallahassee. I bike packed 7 days in West Virginia cowboy style and loved  it...as long I had a local mom style restaurant each day!! Have done  several 1-4 day backpacking trips Florida and Georgia... Pine mountain, Ecofina river, Aucilla river, Chipola river, Apalachicola forest, Suwanee river... Love my Hubba tent after 5-6 camps over the past 2 years.They did replace it due to mold. This week I tested a diy hobo can stove with my 4 year old grandson Cater and it cooked hot dogs well with Pine needles and sticks. Carter poured lake water around to prevent fire...and drops on my hot dogs.  It fits in my 2L aluminum pot. I am trying to avoid wasteful throw away gas cartridges. My Sol Bivy works well to about 45 degrees. I tried adding $19 emergency reflective blanked whiched worked well until 2AM last night when I got cold at 36 degrees due to condensation! Will look for down blanket. My thick wigwam socks kept my feet warm. I liked my Columbia reflective medium tights. I like my Thermarest Air Core Insulated pad but it may have very slow leak after 3 years. BUT last night test camp I had  to pee...3 times. Will drink less before bed  and have a pee bottle.  A beaver kept slapping our lake. Coyotes keep barking. Will use ear plugs? Although I like nature night sounds.  I have an old about 1980s wife bought thrift shop external frame High Peaks Simex Sport I love. I have 1999 era PUR filters. Will continue testing (most of my improvements fail).  I set my retirement for July 1 and driving to Maine for SOBO about July 10. Will start light but will hit cold winter and add weight. Thanks!",,Home porch,"Jan 26, Sat",0
