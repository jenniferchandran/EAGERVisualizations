KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611044,"On a day hike last month, my hiking buddy Grace suggested backpacking through Shenandoah National Park. We finally settled on a date, but our window of opportunity was narrowed to 4 days instead of 7. That's enough time to hike half the park, not the whole thing. Complicating matters, the southern end of Skyline Drive is closed due to blowdowns from winter storms. It took some study, but we came up with a workable itinerary. But we didn't find anybody else who wanted to join us. (In case you're wondering, Grace and I are friends and hiking companions. She's married, and I'm in a relationship.)
We drove to Reeds Gap this morning, parked, and rode a shuttle to the trailhead at the end of Browns Gap Turnpike. Well, not quite the end. The ""turnpike"" is a single-lane dirt road that became impassible even in our 4WD SUV about a mile before the end, so we had to walk a little farther than we planned. No big deal. 
We started hiking uphill on the ""approach trail"" at 12:35, and we turned left onto the southbound Appalachian Trail along a ridgeline about two hours later. The rain began almost immediately after we reached the AT. An inch or so of rain fell during on-and-off thunderstorms before we reached Blackrock Hut shortly after 5:00. Fortunately, there was room for us in the shelter so we didn't need to erect tents in the rain. Equally fortunately, it was mild, perhaps 60°, so being wet wasn't especially uncomfortable. Grace and I were in good spirits, even though we had some gear issues. She had left her poles in her car and my water filter wasn't working.
We ate supper, socialized with the 9 others in the shelter, hung up wet clothes (inside) and our food bags (outside), and turned in early, most of us reading quietly before nodding off.  
There's usually a convivial vibe among hikers who are out in bad weather. Stormy weather tends to keep the whiners at home. Tonight was no exception. People talked matter-of-factly about the weather, but I didn't hear a single whine."," Browns Gap Turnpike

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611320,"Despite a promising evening, it wasn't a good night for sleeping. There ended up being 11 people in a shelter designed for 10. The late arrivals made supper first, then used bright headlamps to set up their sleeping bags. I was on the upper level, and despite using his high-beam, one of the latecomers stepped on my inflatable sleeping pad two or three times. That created a waterbed effect, not conducive to staying asleep. Well before 5:00 AM, the early risers switched on their bright headlamps to make coffee.  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE use your red LED on low brightness when you're in a shelter and others are trying to sleep!
I started out at 7:55, before Grace. I had decided to make a blue-blaze detour since I had already done this section of the AT: Riprap Trail and Wildcat Ridge Trail. It added about 3 miles and 2000 feet elevation gain. The Riprap Trail features, as you might expect, some impressive rock formations and a couple nice viewpoints from atop rockpiles. Eventually the trail descended into a picturesque river gorge, and then it began criss-crossing the river. Yesterday's heavy rains caused the river to rise substantially, making it impossible to rock-hop. One ford followed another over the next two miles, five wet crossings in total. One was up to my knees, another was well above them. Brr! Knowing that nobody else was likely to pass by today, I loosened my pack straps and chose my footing very carefully as I forded. I was thankful for the steep climb back up to the AT on the Wildcat Ridge Trail because it warmed me up. (It was in the 40s, very windy, and not very sunny.)
I was surprised to come across Grace about a half mile after rejoining the AT. I expected she'd be well ahead of me. We walked mostly together the rest of the way together to Calf Mountain Shelter, the southernmost shelter in SNP. Thru-hikers Vagabond Jack and  Amazing spent the night in the shelter. Grace and I tented, figuring our tents would keep us warmer in the high winds than an open shelter would. 
It was very windy, and I got cold almost as soon as I finished supper, so I hung my food bag on the bear pole and crawled into my sleeping bag fully dressed at 7:30.","BlackRock Hut

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611323,"I was so cold and tired last night that I fell asleep fully dressed almost before I warmed up. I spent 11 1/2 hours in my bag, almost all of it asleep. It was probably the best sleep I've had in a couple years. Grace didn't fare so well. To save weight she carried only an insulated sleeping bag liner instead of a warm mummy bag or quilt. It was a cold night for her.
It was still cold (30s) this morning, but the wind had abated considerably. Oatmeal and coffee warmed me up. I didn't leave camp until 10:40, the last one out as usual. The sun was warming things up by then, and the outer layers of clothing came off quickly. I caught up with Grace on Little Calf Mountain, not long after I started. After a video chat with her husband Rick, we walked together the rest of the day. 
The weather was ideal for hiking: sunny, a little breeze, and temperatures peaking near 60°F. We crossed a handful of thru-hikers in SNP and our first day hikers when we were within a mile of Rockfish Gap, the southern boundary of Shenandoah National Park, where Skyline Drive was closed. There were a lot of cars parked just outside the barricade, and we soon found out why. The road closure apparently took many people by surprise, so they parked and walked southbound on the AT. We saw lots of day hikers and chatted with a few.
There were considerably more blowdowns south of Rockfish Gap, but the Old Dominion Appalachian Trail Club had done an admirable job of cutting and clearing enormous amounts of debris. Walking was easy along a smooth and gently sloped path in this section. We arrived at Paul Wolfe Shelter at 5:30. I set up my tent between the shelter and a very full stream, while Grace decided to sleep in the shelter. A group of six men, mostly schoolteachers, had built and tended a nice campfire. We chatted around the fire and admired the nearly-full moon for a while before I headed to my tent at 8:30.","Calf Mountain Shelter

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612223,"Today dawned 20°F warmer than yesterday. That made it far easier to emerge from my sleeping bag. By the time the sun hit our campsite, I was comfortable in shirt sleeves. What a difference a day can make!
The schoolteachers left at 8:00, Grace started at 8:25, and I hung around the campsite until 9:00. The trail climbed 2000' over the first six miles from the campsite. Long, gradual ascents are my specialty, and I was looking forward to it. It didn't disappoint. I was able to get into a steady rhythm up the hill, noticing the vegetation change from mid-spring to late winter. 
I took a couple of blue-blazed detours to overlooks. Humpback Rocks, near a Blue Ridge Parkway parking lot, were very crowded with day hikers. A Montessori school had transported two busloads of students to the site. It was great to see kids exploring and enjoying the outdoors. To my surprise, Robert, one of the schoolteachers from last night, showed up as I was finishing lunch. His group had finished their overnight hike, but he decided to put in a few extra miles before driving home. We chatted for a few minutes before I left. 
I caught up with Grace as she was finishing her lunch about a mile past Humpback Rocks. Later, a couple of dayhikers took a photo of us at Wintergreen View. Otherwise, we didn't see many hikers after Humpback; none after Wintergreen. 
The last few miles were tough: very uneven, rocky treadway. The trail wasn't especially steep, but we were tired from the climb, the air was humid, and the last six miles seemed to go on forever. Spotting a herd of six does crossing the trail just ahead of us gave us a psychological lift. They were the only large animals we saw on this hike; no bears, disappointingly. 
We got to Reeds Gap a few minutes before 5:00 and drove down the hill to Devils Backbone brewery. There was some confusion because the computers were down and we hadn't reserved a campsite in advance. It took a little back-and-forth with the staff and camp host to settle on a tentsite. We pitched our tents, showered, ate dinner, had a beer or two, and went to bed. I fell asleep with my clothes on... the second time on this trip. 
The Devils Backbone tentsites are nicely wooded and generously spaced, but many of them are poorly graded. After seeing the site we were assigned, we asked to be moved. The camp host accommodated us with a smile. Best tentsites: 71 (double), 72, 69, 64, 63.","Paul C. Wolfe Shelter
