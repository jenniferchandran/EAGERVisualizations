After reading so many great journals by other hikers over the years, I realize that there is a real talent in describing ones though processes and planning rituals as one prepares for  hike like this.  Sadly, in creating these entries to get started, it is painfully obvious why I never pursued a career in writing!  Oh well, it is all about the hike, not the writing.  Maybe that part will get easier once the hiking starts, I hope so anyway.",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Sun",0

Something tells me these next 2 1/2 months will pass quickly.  Still hopeful that at least one or maybe both sons will be able to join the start of my journey, but too early to say on that right now.  Trying to work on ""journaling' skill set as well.  I haven't attempted an update with my phone yet, but need to practice that too.  Maybe I will put together my gear list, so I'll see about that.  Til next time.",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Sun",0
Perdido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607131,"I have met a fellow 2019 Thru Hiker, Popps, from Milton, FL, who will be starting around 3/02, a few weeks before my planned start date (3/22).  He has been great to share his hiking/gear/outdoors knowledge and expertise, as well as giving me a couple of trash compactor bags, as I was having no luck locating those. We have met for lunch a couple of times to talk everything AT, from gear to food to logistics and everything in between.  
We recently did an overnight shake down hike in the Blackwater National Forest in Northwest Florida.  When I got to Popps house, he offered to weigh my almost loaded pack.  It came in at 30 lbs, so I was pleased at that.  It had everything I will be carrying except for extra food and my puffy coat and gloves.  The forecast was for rain, which we both wanted in order to test our gear, but the rain didn't arrive until after we hiked out the second day.  Regardless, we had a good, though uneventful 8+ mile hike the first day before making camp.  Camp was setup, Popps in his hammock, me in my tent, and after a while, we cooked our dinner.  It was a rather warm day and humid, so nothing like we will experience in Georgia!  
Have been doing lots of hiking with a mostly full pack, but sandy & flat is certainly not the same as what I will experience in the mountains of North Georgia, and I understand that.  Still, practice is needed to get used to the weight of the pack and how to get the best setup so it feels comfortable.  Also breaking in Merrill boots, but my Darn Tough socks are causing blisters, so need to figure out why that is happening.  
Departure time is getting closer and I am growing anxious about the start and looking forward to the challenge.  Local hiking will continue, packing and unpacking continues and I also plan to experiment with cooking the foods I will carry.  No dehumidifier, so it will be the usual instant stuff one can find at the stores, pasta, potatoes, rice, etc., along with mixes of tuna and chicken for dinners.  I’m sure that will get old in short order.  Oh well, practice will continue along with the countdown.  Ready to get started!","

Getting really anxious and nervous about the whole thing!  Have already seen entries on the 2019 AT Facebook page of a few hikers who have already called it quits for a variety of reasons. That doesn’t help the confidence factor at all. 
This is my 1st entry using my phone as all others have been done from the comforts of the home PC. Hoping I can make it all work. Adding a picture will be interesting too!  
My pack is full and heavy, still need to load my nalgene bottle and not sure where that will be. Knowing there will be cold days & nights ahead I may have more clothes than needed but not much. If I had a bigger pack it would just be heavier so that’s not the answer. I’m sure I will figure out what to shed in due time. So many unknowns at this point. 
Can’t wait to earn a Trail Name and may start with a self given “Perdido"", which is Spanish for lost - not because I feel lost or because I am searching, merely because we live on Perdido Bay in Pensacola, FL!  We’ll see what happens. Looks like phone entries wont be too bad, but updates will be depending on battery life & signal strength and since AT&T is my carrier, can’t count on that too often either. 
The journey is about to start & again have to thank my wife for her support of this dream or I could never do this. She will have her hands full with our 2 dogs, bills, her Mom and all the daily activities of living!  Thanks Mic!  Friends & neighbors have also been very supportive & curious about my hike and all say they will help out on the homefront while I’m gone. 4 days and counting.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Mon",0

Perdido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609228,"While  I have Internet I thought I would give up just a brief rundown of a typical day even though I haven’t been out here that long. I wake up early and it doesn’t get light until well after seven so it’s still quite dark but I will start my routine by changing out of my sleep clothes which are basically long underwear and find my dirty stinky hiking clothes which I have shoved into the sleeping bag to try to warm them up a little bit before putting them on. I’ll get dressed and into my hiking cloths, start packing what I can inside the tent like my sleeping bag & pad, before getting outside. Sleep clothes are stufed, bag and pad stuffed then its on to tent. I move around the tent pulling out all the tent pegs and knock the dirt off of them then I’ll pull down the rain fly and disconnect it from the tent itself then removing the tent poles putting them in their bag, fold up the tent shove it into the stuff sack and then the rain fly goes in on top of that and I compress all that so it fits in the pack. I stuff my sleeping bag And clothes into my pack and I follow that down inside the trash compactor bag in case it rains during the day and that will keep those key items dry then the tent the cookie kit food and everything else that the water can’t really hurt goes in on top of the sleeping bag and clothes that are inside the trash compactor bag. Once you get everything loaded inside your pack and strap it on and start your morning hike. I try to hike for at least an hour,  hour and a half maybe even two hours and then take a morning break,  eat a breakfast bar, energy bar, pop tarts some little snack just to get a little burst of energy because again after camping in one of the gaps at night you’re going to immediately start walking uphill and often times I can’t go more than a 50 or 100 yards and then it’s time to take a 10 second break and you just keep repeating that until you eventually get to the top of one of these many mountains. After a short break you then you’re hiking again for another two hours and then it’s time to take a lunch break. basically you are  looking for a good view spot so you can look out over the many valleys in the gap’s and have a little lunch, which might be a pita or a tortilla with some peanut butter spread on it or some jerky or trail mix, just whatever easy to have during lunch because obviously nobody takes the time to cook at lunch.  Other hikers of been great sharing information and giving you tips on things I’ve learned some good tips about my tent that has been helpful. You can’t camp anywhere you want to contrary to what some people might think. There are tenting areas around the shelters if you choose not to sleep in the shelter. You are asked to stay on those areas and that helps reduce the impact to the environment & hikers are not just camping wherever they want to. In addition the trail is either going up or down a mountain there’s no level ground to place a tent anyway so that’s why all these tent sites or shelters are in the gap’s between the mountains so that there’s a somewhat level land and gives you an opportunity to set your tent. Atnight you reverse the morning activity- find tent site, find water, filter water, set up tent, change out of hiking clothes, rest then decide on your dinner. Cook ir not (heat water to hydrate something) talk to other hikers, now its cold, so crawl into sleeping bag for the night.","

It made for a very long cold and wet night. No cooking in the rain, so meal was several snacks!  Thankfully rain stopped before dawn but had topack a wet tent.

You might be lucky to get a weak signal on top of some of these mountains but it takes too much battery searching for a signal to keep turning my phone on.

Perdido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609254,Today would technically qualify as a Nero day which means you just didn’t hike many miles.  The reason for this for us was because of my miscalculation on which Gap or Road crossing we came to so I could call my friend John Glenn or New best friend Patti!  Regardless after talking with some other hikers at deep gap and they told us that a certain kind of way we were looking for was right down the dirt road we made the call to Patti and after about an hour she came and picked us up that is Jerry and myself because he wanted to get off the trail to the resupply and have a days rest so Patti rescued us brought us to her house and this is where we will spend Saturday night and Sunday night and then resume our travel down the trail first thing Monday morning so it is been most relaxing and wonderful Patti has made us feel like members of her family and we have thoroughly enjoyed our time here we have gotten closed washed we’ve been fed she’s taking us to town to resupply so we are loaded and ready to head out tomorrow morning.One thing that I remembered is that I failed to mention in the previous post was that we had finally left the state of Georgia and took a picture of the North Carolina /Georgia border sign which of course is a great step to leave one state behind only 13 more states to go. After today I honestly have no idea when I might be able to make another journal entry because again it requires good service and an Internet connection and so far with my AT&T service that is just been nonexistent on the trail so please bear with me it may be a little bit before I’m able to provide another update but I’ll be doing the best I can thanks to all of you for the moral support.

Perdido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609817,"Sunday, March 31 was my first official zero day meaning I hiked no trail miles for this day we had the pleasure of staying once again at Patti’s house who was kind enough to pick us up yesterday afternoon and tonight we are going to have hamburgers and a big salad for dinner. While at Patti’s she also invited over her next-door neighbor Carol and zoot and I will so we got to have dinner with them and make some new friends. I’ll take it vantage of this zero day to try to fill you in a little bit about life on the trail I can assure you it is far from glamorous because he’ll want to get up and get dressed and then lately of course that means very cold and damp mornings you get on your hiking clothes And start hiking.  The camping and shelters are typically all down in a gap between large mountains because that’s where the water sources are and also it helps cut down on the wind while you’re trying to set up your tents.  The steep climbs out of the gaps require frequent breaks, at least they do for me.  Most mornings we wake up and climb into the clouds and fog so as you walk along a lot of the ridgelines even at the view spot there’s nothing to view right now because it’s all obscured and clouds just imagine you’ve taken your hot shower and you go over to your bathroom mirror and it’s all fogged up, well that’s basically like the view that we see when we look at the valley far below. Sometime around noon or maybe 1230 we start looking for a sunny spot if there is one and maybe a log or some flat rocks to sit down and have a lunch break and will usually take 30 to 40 minutes depending on what we’re eating and then we resume our hike. The afternoon is much the same.  As we approach the gap or the shelter where will be tenting for the night, It usually begins a long slow descent.  I think of all types of things I would like to post in my journal while I’m hiking and also while I am attempting to sleep at night but now that I’ve gotten the opportunity to do some updating it’s hard to remember those things so maybe I’ll get better at this and again just let you know that having Internet access to make a journal update is very very difficult out here and I will do what I can.","Otto NC

The only downside to sleeping in the tent is that in the early morning hours when you have to change out of your sleep clothes into your hiking clothes believe me it is quite cold outside in the mountains still I’m not sure the actual temperature but I dare say it was in the low to me at mid 30s and the shelter itself because of so many people in there at least there is a an element of warmth that you don’t get it all when you sleep in your tent.  Nothing really exciting is happening during all of this I mean it’s basically you get on your hiking clothes you start hiking after an hour so take a short little break maybe eat a snack then hike again till lunchtime take a little bit longer break for lunch and if the suns out now that I like to take my shoes and socks off let my toes air out let my socks dry little bit my shoes dry a little bit while I’m eating lunch then you just going to pack everything back up and take off hiking for the afternoon. I’ve certainly met a lot of interesting people out here on the trail and I’ve tried to make notes on some of the trail names, but is often difficult to get enough information to add a story about the people, but trust me when I tell you there a lot of unique individuals out here. I think so far I’ve met at least four or five people from Germany, a lady from Ukraine and an Irishman that we’ve met recently, Trail name Whitey, from his childhood.  There is also a lady that is almost the same pace that Jerry and I have maintained.  She moved to the US from Beijing China and she is just fascinated with the trail. The other day in the rain she was hiking with a small umbrella and a great big camera taking pictures of everything. Her trail name is Click!

When asked to elaborate, she said trails out West you can walk & look while walking. On the AT, you have to keep your head down most all the time due to rocks, roots, mud, high steps, low steps, etc.  When we see a side trail to a ledge for a view, we’ll check it out if pretty weather otherwise we keep walking, with head down watching for loose rocks and wet roots!  John has appts to keep, so Patti dropped him at his car, we got a shower and off to an oufitters for shoe replacements. Bad weather predicted for next 2 or 3 days so we will see how long we stay.

Most days, the hiking starts around 7:45 - 8:00 but we started around 7:00 knowing it was going to be a long day. 
It helped that we were towards the end of the Smokies so no mire climbs, most of the hiking was down hill. An interesting aspect in some parts of the Trail as you hike along the ridges, you will have the path, maybe 4 or 5 feet wide, but on either side, you have drop offs of several hundred feet!  It is wide enough to be safe, but you don’t want any mistakes or you could find yourself at the bottom of some very rough terrain. It is still head down hiking due to rocks, roots and mud. 
We hiked past several shelters, took a few short breaks to snack and kept moving.  We could finally hear traffic sounds and came to the box where we deposited the other half of our Smokies Permit. Half goes in a box when you enter the Park, other half when you leave the Park. We still had about 3 miles to the Hostel but we had finished the Smokies!

While not freezing or anything, it is still not a fun way to start your morning by getting out of your sleep clothes and back into your hiking clothes. I have tried to improve my morning routine and become more efficient and take less time so the hiking can commence. Here is a brief summary of what I do: Take off sleep clothes, put on hiking clothes except for shoes, put on rain jacket for warmth since puffy needs to be packed, sleep clothes go into stuff sack, toiletries and all other zip lock bags sealed and packed, sleeping bag put in compression bag, air out of sleep pad and it has to be rolled twice to get air out then trifold to put in stuff sack along with inflatable pillows. Everything inside tent is in its bag ready to be packed. Now it’s outside to take down the tent. Off comes rain fly, set aside, out come tent stakes unless real windy, in which case stakes remain till later. Tent comes down, stuff in tent bag then put in rain fly, won’t fit properly unless tent in first. Breakdown tent poles, gather 6 tent stakes, so only thing not ready for packing is ground cloth. I use that to stage everything fir loading to my pack.  Now off to retrieve my food bag which is hanging by a rope from a tree limb nearby.  Now time to pack it all. Clothes go inside a trash compactor bag in case of rain, every thing else on top of clothes. Trying to distribute weight so food bag in middle, cook kit and remaining items stuffed in. Tent stacks, poles and folded up ground cloth in side pocket and you hope you can snap all the buckles and straps. Oh, if you cook breakfast, you need to leave needed items out to do this. Some are very efficient at this process, I’m still learning, but usually get it dinein 30 - 45 minutes.Now you are ready to hike. Head down, get ready to climb.  Most days, unless on a ridge or too, there are no views. There is finally mire green everywhere as Spring is arriving in the mountains.

While details are still uncertain 24 hours later, I know at least 2 hikers were attacked overnight by a disturbed individual who had been arrested earlier in TN for harassment of hikers but released. He was even provided a bus ticket home and got on the bus and left the area. Unfortunately, he came back. An awful event to be sure that has many hikers talking here in Marion.

Lickskillet is .5 miles off the Trail, it was only noon, so neither Sharkchow nor No Keys cared to walk an extra mile, even for a soda. Off I went to get my packages. The Hostel is really nice, owned by Hiker Mongo and is operated by donations. It is an old, 1911 Church converted into a Hostel. Beds fill the old sanctuary and while rustic, it has great potential.I got a City Paper hat & shirt from Drew, then my surprise from Rob contained pictures of all my family!  Great pics of Drew & Megan, Rob & Challice & Harper Rea, and of course Mic!  A great group shit prior to a recent Dave Matthews Band concert in Pensacola they attended. Sorry I missed that show. So back to hiking and trying to catch the group. Snowman was at the road crossing, headed to Lickskillet for the night so he wasn’t joining me, but I pushed on another 3.5 miles to join Sharkchow & No Keys at Trent’s Grocery. They also grill sandwiches here, so that took care of dinner again. Camping is allowed in a field close to the gas station, so for $6.00 each, we had a camping spot!  No Keys and I later said goodbye to Sharkchow as his wife arrived to take him away on a planned vacation for the 2 of them.
