The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606398,"A little over a year ago I took a great interest in hiking the Appalachian Trail. My daughter and I did a couple of overnight weekend trips. We did 24 and 27 mile respectively. I was hooked. I went out and purchased a book about it.Then another and another. Books were being delivered every week. I couldn't get enough of it. My wife said to me ""you really want to do a thru hike don't you""? I said ""yeah I do"". So she said ""well go ahead"". I'm like REALLY!!!  that's all it took, I got my wife's blessing to do the AT. Now over the last year I have researched  everything about a thru hike. The gear, what preparation, what do you eat, etc.etc. It has pretty much consumed all my free time. Let's fast forward to today......I am a little less than a month away from the greatest challenge of my life. I am so excited and nervous at the same time. But a good kind of nervous. About 95% of my gear is purchased. Still need a few small items. I have done my first shakedown hike. I am getting things buttoned up at home, trying to make things easier for my wife and two daughters while I am gone for 5 to 6 months. Now its just getting in more hikes and counting down the days.                                              The Hankster                                                 T - 27 DAYS",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Sun",0
The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606399,"Last weekend I did my first overnight shakedown hike. I started at Waywayanda State Park in northern New Jersey to Wildcat Shelter which is 8 miles across the New York border along the AT. Aside for a minor issue with my pack, the gear tested out well. The tent held up well on a pretty windy night. My sleep system was fine. I  was nice and warm. The overnight real feel low was 9°. Total round trip 26 miles. I plan on doing a bunch more shakedowns in the coming weeks.",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Sun",0
The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606400,"My flight is booked. I will be flying to Atlanta the morning of Friday, Febuary 8th, where I will be picked up at the airport by a long time family friend Linda and her husband Leo. They have graciously invited me to stay at there house Friday night and will drop me off at Amicalola Falls State Park Saturday morning. From there I will begin the unofficial start of my journey. When I say unofficial I mean to get to the official start you have to hike to Springer Mountain the southern terminus of the AT. You start by climbing 604 steps to the top of the falls and then hike 8.3 miles. For a total of 8.8 miles and have gained in altitude of just over 2000ft. Then on Sunday February 10th  I will take my first of what is said to be over 5 million steps.",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Sun",0
The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606943,"Today started the official miles. I did 7.9 miles. It was cold with freezing rain  I cut the day short as the forecast called for heavy rain later in the afternoon. Hiking in 30 degree rain is alot different than in 50 degree. It's not fun .But nobody said it would be.  I'm going to take the first 2 to 3 weeks slow. Somewhere between 8 to 12 miles. The bigger days will come. No sense in risking an injury early the game. Its 8:30 close to hiker midnight which 9:00. Time for bed.

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606969,"Last night I was awakened by assault rifle gunfire. The Army Rangers do maneuvers during the night.  They practice in about 20 miles of the area. At 7::00 this morning they let off a loud boom.  Time to get up.  Lol. Today was very foggy with on and off rain. Saw some soldiers on the trail getting ready for tonights practice. I saw shell casings on the trail. Pretty cool.  Got my first trail magic today. There were four gaIlons of water next to a tree for us to fill up.I'm with a group of other hikers. There are 7 of us, we were together last night. Everyone heads out in the morning at different times. And you see them on the trail. Everyone has their own pace. You eventually meet up at the next shelter.I realized that my lengthy  post from Saturday never went through. So I am going to give you an abbreviated version.  I started the Approach Trail at Amicalola Falls State Park by climbing 600 steps then hiked 8.3 miles to Springer Mountain (the southern terminus of the AT) for a total of 8.8 miles. They say if you can do the approach you are good to go the rest of the way.  I got to Springer Shelter and set up my tent. Then went to catch a most beautiful sunset. The first of many to come. What an ending to my first day. There are people I would like to thank. First to my beautiful wife Maureen for giving me her blessing to fulfill my dream. And to my daughters Beki and Bri for their continued support. I'm sorry I bored all of you with all my talk about the AT over the last year.  LOL  Thanks for listening. To Linda, Leo, and Chole Cruz for picking me up at the airport. And graciously inviting me into their home. Then taking me to the trail for my start. Trail Angels before I'm even on the trail. To all my family and friends who have supported me.To everyone who has liked and commented words of encouragement on facebook. WOW!!   I Feel The Love.To my family, friends and people I don't even know who wrote on my guest page on this site.  I thank you. It means alot.To all the wonderful people that I met doing the stairs and on the approach. All the well wishes and encouraging cheers were awesome.Thanks so much.Ha ha and I thought I was going to give a short version. I hope you enjoy the ride. It has only just begun.THANK YOU ALLIt has just started pouring. I am dry, safe and warm in my tent.DON'T COUNT THE STEPS MAKE THE STEPS COUNT ","Hawk Mountain Shelter

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607015,"Heavy rains overnight. Got up this morning to fog. Had some banana pancake trail magic this morning. Had the honor of meeting Fresh Ground, the Angel of all trail Angel's. He runs Leap Frog Cafe. He follows hikers all the way to Maine making sure we are all fed. 
I'm part of a small trail family. I'm with Atermis, Broccoli Rob, Lucas. We been together for the past three days. It got pretty bad today a big storm came through. We got to a road where there was a pavilion and restrooms. So the four of us were holed up in the ladies room for two hourswaithing for a shuttle. Artemis had a cabin reservation for a few days from now that she switched to tonight. So the four of us are sharing a cabin. It is supposed to go down to 28 overnight with wind gusting to 35 mph. Pretty much all of our gear is wet from all the rain. No sense being cold and wet. Plus a shower and laundry sounded good. It also gives us a chance to dry out our gear. THANK YOU ARTEMIS
So tonight I am safe and nice and warm sleeping in a cabin.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

We got shuttled back to Woody Gap, where we left off yesterday. The sun made an appearance with temps in the low 40's today.  Finally got to see some more of these beautiful mountain ranges. It started off with a nice climb up to Preaching Rock where got our first view. There were a few more challenging uphills throughout the day. Got to the shelter in time to set up and make dinner just as the sun was setting. Tomorrow we will start with a tough 800ft ascend in just over a mile. I have been hiking with our little trail family of four. What a fun group, all of us have a fun time together.  Its 8pm time for bed.I'm safe and warm in my tent.","Woody Gap

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607064,"This morning we climbed Blood Mountain, the highest on the AT in Georgia at 4457ft. Artemis left camp at 4:30 am to catch the sunrise  at the top. We cut off our day at 3.6 miles at Mountain Crossing. It's an outfitter that the trail goes right through the store. This is the point on the trail that alot of hikers quit. The trees out front have loads of boots hanging from the branches. It's pretty cool.  You are not going to see mine up there. Broccoli Rob had a resupply box waiting for him.Tomorrow Artemis and Lucas have some new gear being delivered late in the day. So we are going to spend the night at the Blood Mountain Cabins and again tomorrow night.  We are going to take a zero (no miles) tomorrow.

Our plan is to hike the next five days to our next resupply. Then play it by ear from there. The weather for the next couple of days is calling for about two inches of rain. The beginning to the middle the week is going to be very wet. Around five inches of rain being predicted. I am safe and warm in a cabin.,"Blood Mountain Cabins

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607099,"Another rainy night, In the morning I waited for it to slow down enough so I could pack up. Everything was soaked, .....it was so cold and windy breaking down I couldn't feel my fingers. I broke camp first the rest of my family (trail family) were still in there tents or not quite finished. I wanted to start hiking towarm up. It was raw,  ......the wind was blowing the rain sideways up on the ridges. We planned on doing  ten miles today, but that didn't take long to change. As I was hiking along I came upon a guy and his dog doing a section hike going southbound. I saw them coming distance ahead of me so I made my presence known as not to spook the dog. But awhile later Lucas was coming up a hill with his head down, (it's what you do most of the time as to not look to see how much more you have to go). So this dog charges at Lucas barking and tugging at his flapping poncho. It startled him and as he went to fend him off he twisted his knee. Ouch. I was a ways ahead but I stopped to filter some water and have a snack.  When I was ready to start of again I saw him limping up a hill. Upon hearing what happened I suggested we go back a quarter mile to a shelter. While he rested I went back to the trail to meet up with Armetis and Broccoli Rob. About two hours later we hiked out to find a stealth site to spend the night.....Later we heard that the guy said Lucas should have been looking where he was going. NO his dog should have been on a leash. So we only got in 5.7 miles today.  That's ok we look out for each other.
So after eight days I am feeling good, nothing to complain about.  I am satisfied with what I have accomplished so far. I am in it for the long haul.I have nothing to prove to anyone by putting in long miles now. They will come.The views are magnificent, just wish I could see more. But that will come also.
I am part of a little tramily. We met a week ago. And have been together since. We all  encourage and look out for each other. They are all so cool. I am so glad I met them....Armetis is originally from Maine, now living in Georgia.I guess you could say she is hiking home from home. Broccoli Rob is from Georgia. And Lucas is from Alabama.
It's still raining and calling for heavy downpours overnight. Oh well!!!! That's all part of being a thru-hiker. 
This is so much fun.

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607098,"This an update from Saturday.  I wrote one Saturday night but when I tried to post it I lost the signal I had and lost everything I wrote.  That's twice it has happened. I think in the future if the signal is weak I am going to hold off on writing unless I can find a way to save them. And post when signal is stronger.  Ok here goes it rained all night ending just before daybreak. The first patt of the day we hiked in fog. The sun came out in the afternoon. When we do get a view it is incredible. Seems like we are in the clouds most days. When I started a week ago it was forecasted for rain 11 out of the first 14 days. Pretty much how it has been.  We had some trail from a gentleman named Bobby. Very nice guy.  He had coffee, lemonade, water, cake, choclate and fruit. He also had chairs.  Woo hoo!!. While we were sitting there a car pulled up and out jumped this family from Tennessee.  A husband, wife and three kids. They were so intrigued to meet thru hikers doing the AT. He asked all sorts of questions. He even offered us water and snacks. We took pictures with the family. We felt like celebrities. Ha ha..... I can see them doing trail magic in the future..... Back in the woods we hiked a short distance to a campsite and set up for the night. Overnight forecast is calling for heavy rain......Still taking it slow. Do not want to risk injury. There are some hikers that I have been following on social media that started before me that are sidelined with injuries. I do not want to be patt of that statistic. Tonight I am safe and warm in my tent. Remember this post is for Saturday.","Neels Gap

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607193,"It rained during the night, downpoured at times. Woke up at about 7:30 to sunny skies and a nice breeze. We hung around camp for a couple of hours to let our tents dry out. It was sunny all day in the 40's. But when you got to the top of the mountains it was very blustery, it really made things cold. We were moving along pretty good today, the first seven miles were not to bad. Then we had a rough eleven hundred foot decend over boulders for a mile and a half. Man those downhills hurt. That brought us to Unicoi Gap. Artemis left us there to shuttle into town where she will stay at a hostle tonight and to resupply and get some better rain gear. Hopefully we will meet up with her again soon. The climb out of Unicoi Gap was brutal, an eleven hundred foot ascend in a mile and a quarter. That was a killer climb near the end of a long day. We put in our longest mileage today 12.1 miles. We're camping at the Cheese Cake Factory Campsite, not like the place I'm used to. Update: Lucas is feeling better.

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607197,"I woke up at 7:00 to the pitter patter of freezing rain hitting the roof of my tent. It was a sign of things to come. I was in no hurry to break camp. Broccoli Rob and Lucas left around 9:45, I was about twenty minutes behind. There was a steady drizzle, heavy at times, throughout the day. The trail was a sheet of ice crystals and all the branches had a coating of ice. It was a bone chilling day. I got to the shelter at 2;30 just as it started pouring. I was soaked and cold, my fingers were numb. There was no way that I was going to set up my tent in that. After about a half hour it let up. I got the tent up and got out of my wet clothes and hung them up wherever I could. I then crawled inside my sleeping bag which I wasn't leaving. Nothing is going to dry, I'll just put them back on wet tomorrow. I had an early dinner just as a round of thunderstorms rolled in. The lightning flash and the clap of thunder were right over us. Damn it was bright and loud. I believe tomorrow we are planning on a nero ( not a zero but not to many miles). We may stay at a hostle. Today we did 9.4 miles not bad giving the conditions.
I would like to thank all of you who signed my guest book. Your encouraging words are overwhelming. I feel blessed .It really means alot. 
To my niece Robyn who comments just about every other day. Hopefully someday soon I can give you a call.
To Phil Barlow for the tip on writing these journals in my notes when there is a weak or no signal at all. Then copy and paste them when a signal is available. Secondly CONGRATULATIONS on completing this amazing journey last year. I thought your name sounded familiar. I was following your journals. Way to go Bald Eagle.

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607238,"Guess what???? .....it was another rainy night. I had to get up in the middle of the night and my tent zippers were frozen. My tent looked like an igloo, it had a sheet of ice all over it. This morning the trail was covered with ice that fell from the branches. They looked like ice cubes.Today was an easy day, only four miles as we neroed,  arriving at the hostel around 1:00. After showering and getting our laundry done we got shuttled into town for dinner and a resupply. I managed to get my tent dried out using fans supplied in the bunk room. Why, I don't know, it's only going to get wet again tomorrow. I guess it's nice to at least start out dry. I guess it's the little things thatmake me  happy. There are five of us tonight. Myself, Lucas, Broccoli Rob, and a married couple Jeremy and Julie who we have seen at the shelters a few times. Very nice people.I am hiking out with them in the morning as the guys are sticking around for another gear delivery on Friday. Lucas has a theory that you see what you really need as you go. He started his hike at 18 lbs. Including food and water. He was carrying what looked like a book bag. He is now at over 30 lbs.He got a new tent and now a new larger pack.

Out here everybody has a different pace you ""hike your own hike"". I hiked alone today.  My little tramily has temporarily separated. We planned to hike to Plum Orchard Shelter. Seeing that it was 11:40 when I arrived I had lunch while waiting for them. About an hour later they show up, seeing that it was early and I was feeling good I decided to hike at least another five miles. They said they would do the same after they took a break.Today we had some breaks with the rain. It started off rainng steadily then to a drizzle. Then it got so foggy, and after a few minutes the sun trying to peak out. I was finally able to take my phone out and take some pictures. It didn't rain for an hour or so.WOW .Then of course after taking off the rainjacket it downpoured for a minute. Oh well I'm soaked from sweat anyway. It actually felt good. Today I hit a milestone. I have completed the state of Georgia. I have crossed into North Carolina.  No more singing ""Another Rainy Night In Georgia"".One down thirteen to go. Now as I'm writing this it's pouring in North Carolina. Lol
I forgot to mention in my previous journal, the town (Hiawassee) where we stayed last night is where  they filmed the movie ""Deliverence"". I thought I kept hearing banjos

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607309,"Got up at 7:00 and looked at the forecast. I had a 45 minute window of no rain. So I shifted it into high gear and packed up and broke down my tent. Made it just in time. As I started a climb right out of camp the skies opened up for a long rainy day. Jeremy and Julie left before me. We decided to hike to the second shelter. I soon passed them. About two hours later I saw Artemis and she was also going to the same place. Well I blew by the shelter, and when I checked the gps I was 2 miles passed it. I don't like taking my phone when its raining. No way was I turning back. So on I went for another five miles to a tent site. I took my second fall today, the first was yesterday. I was climbing around a blowdown and coming down the hill it was all mud. I went sliding down on my butt then got to my knees for another ride. I was covered in mud. I got up and looked at myself laughing. It was pretty comical. At least it didn't take long to rinse it all off. Lol. There were alot of blowdowns to negotiate. And the trail was extremely flooded. I just hike through the puddles, no need to try to avoid them, my boots are water logged for the past three days. I believe we have one more day of rain in store. Some of the people I am with have you tube channels videoing their hike.

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607332,"I had no service the last two days.So those entries were posted today (Sunday).The last entry was supposed to be dated for Saturday. I forgot to change the date. My bad.
Also the milage total is off. I am adjusting today's  8.5 miles hiked, to 4.3 to get the actual milage correct.
Hopefully that clears everything up.
So it rained overnight.  Only to wake up to blue skies. I was the last to leave camp, only to catch up a couple miles down the trail. We were all headed into town to resupply, do laundry and shower.I am in dire need of drying my boots out, they are so wet. Everything needed drying out again.
We achieved  another mile stone today, we crossed the 100 mile mark. Just before that we had to climb up to get to a fire tower. It was a butt kicker. That put us at our highest elevation to date at 5250 ft. The view from up top was spectacular.  All you could see were mountain ranges for 360 degrees. After that the hike was a nice downhill to meet our shuttle to the hostel. I'm at the Gooder Grove Hostel in Franklin N.C. It's a nice place and the owner is super cool. I am back with half of our little trail family. Tonight Artemis and I are here. And a day or two behind are Broccoli Rob and Lucas, who is now Scooter.
Two weeks in so far and I have completed 105 miles, an average of about 7.5 miles a day. Right on the schedule of low miles at the beginning. I will be gradually adding a couple each week.
Tomorrow is a zero to resupply and to rest my knee from my fall yesterday. The knee swelled up pretty good.and is quite sore. The downhills are a killer.

That was ok, I was planning on a short day. Only 6.9 miles today. I didnt leave camp until 11:00. It rained part of the day. And when it wasn't you still got wet from all the dripping. I'll tell you, from all the rain there is alot of runoff coming down the mountains going across the trail. In places where there would be a stream maybe two feet wide is now ten to fifteen feet. It makes for some thinking of foot placement on the rocks. Ah heck just go through it the boots are soaked anyway. I took my third fall in as many days. I looked up when I should have kept my eyes on all the roots above ground. I went crashing down on my knee. Man did that hurt. It wasn't to funny today. It's a little swollen. Ok that's three.....Enough!
Artemis, Jeremy and Julie are camping here tonight. My plan is to hike out early in the morning to get to town. I need to get things dried out, especially my boots.

It sure beat eating oatmeal or a pop tart. Then we took a town shuttle bus to Walmart to do a little resupply. Went back to the hostel to drop off our things, then back out for some lunch. I got myself a big cheeseburger and a strawberry shake. I have only been out here for two weeks but you really get to appreciate ""real"" food. Then I went to the post office to send  some items home. One being a book that will never get read and a few things that I have not used and probably won't.

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607412,"I finally had a decent night's sleep. On my trip to Walmart I picked up a brace for my wrist. My carpual tunnel is acting up. Go figure my wrist hurts more than my legs or feet. I guess from the use of my trekking poles it flared up.
Well about 6:00 am everyone in the bunkroom started moving around. We all were all itching to get back out there after a zero. At 7:00 the restaurant opened and we all headed out for breakfast and a shuttle back to the trail.
We got dropped off at different locations as some as some of us got off the trail sooner, as in my case. I was with Jeremy and Julie, Artemis stayed in town waiting for the outfitter to open. She needs me boots, she's having trouble with her feet. The three of us hiked for about a half hour together. They needed to stop and filter some water. I pushed on as we planned to only go to the first shelter, so I would meet them there. Once I got there it was only 1:00 and still so much of the day left plus I was feeling good. So I let them know I was moving on to the next shelter. There were some tough ascends today especially up to Wayah Bald but the view was well worth it. Absolutely beautiful, just all the different mountain ranges. The difference in color as they got further away and deeper in the valley. So off to the shelter, I still had about an hour of daylight left, more than enough time to set up my tent and hang my bear line. The only problem being I couldn't find the shelter. It was more my fault for not being more alert. First it was indicated it was a 1/4 mile further which sure felt like more than that. Then I lost sight of the trail. I thought a blowdown was on the trail but all I had to do was make a hard left and the trail continued. To make a long story short I screwed up. I was wandering up and down the same areas looking for a side trail. While the whole time all I should have done was make that left a go a little further. By the time I found the shelter it was dark. Go figure I can't find it in daylight but I can find it with my headlamp. Lol. There was a couple that I have been seeing from time to time, but haven't hiked with yet already ready there. They talked me into just sleeping in the shelter. This will be my first time sheltering it, I might as well get used to it. In the Smoky Mountains it is mandatory that you sleep in the shelter unless it is full to capacity then you can tent it. So I laid out my pad and bag, had a quick dinner and got settled in for the night
It just started pouring. Im so glad I listened to them.
Today I did 14.7 miles my longest day so far.

I'm glad I listened to the couple Why Not and Handstand. It rained all night and I didn't have to deal with a wet tent in the morning. They are early risers, at 6:30 they started moving about and were gone by 7::00. They said they usually hike the first half hour of the day with their headlamps on. I wasn't budging, I just stayed in my warm bag for another hour. As it was still slightly raining I was in no rush. I ate breakfast and packed up what little I had out and was on the trail by 9:45. I am in awe of the views. Most of the time I'm in low lying areas or I am blocked by the tree line at higher elevations. But when there is a vista the view in incredible. What a beautiful country. Today like all of yesterday except for a half hour I hiked alone. Thats twenty five lonely miles talking to yourself. And I do alot of that. Lol.

As of now I dont believe I can.                                       Like last night, tonight I am sleeping in a shelter. I will give it a try if it's not to crowded and there were no comments of mice activity written in the log book. If there is rain in the forcast ( like for tonight) I may not set up my tent. Everything gets so damp plus it's heavier when wet. I'm trying it for now. We'll see. Tonight I am the only one in the shelter, actually I am the only one here period. Not even tent campers. Nobody wants to hike with me or camp with me. I wonder if it was something I said. Lol.  It can't be the B.O.  We all stink. Lol.Tonight I am safe and warm sleeping in a shelter.","Wayah Shelter

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607478,"Last nights stay in the shelter went off uneventful. There was some scampering about along the roof just after dark but it didn't last long. It sure was dark and quiet. Actually I had a pretty good nights sleep. I got up at around 7:00 and stayed in my sleeping bag catching up on facebook. I knew it was going to be a short day so I was in no rush to get going. I hit the trail at about 9:00, I was only going to the NOC, (The Nantahala Outdoor Center). I arrived there at about noon and met up with Why Not and Handstand for lunch at the Rivers Edge Restaurant. They got here yesterday. We also went there for dinner where we met up with Jeremy and Julie. It's funny how you don't see not a soul for two days and then you are all together again. This place is on the Nantahala River. It must be booming in the summer. They have kayaking, ziplining and other outdoor sports. I got a private bunk room, it's  about the size of a jail cell. It beats sleeping in a shelter or packing up a wet tent. Yeah it's raining out. But it also comes with some scatching noise in the ceiling. Cool! I did manage to get a shower in and do some laundry. I also purchased my permit to enter the Smoky Mountains. In the Smoky's it's mandatory that you sleep in the shelters. If they are full to capacity only then are you allowed to sleep in your tent. But it must be in close vicinity of the shelter. Also you have eight days to hike through them. The extended forcast for the beginning of next week is possible snow and temperatures dropping into the teens overnight. Just in time for when we enter them. Tonight I am safe and warm sleeping in my eight by eight bunkroom.","Wesser Bald Shelter

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607506,"As of a month ago there were 60 hikers registered to start at Springer Mountain in Georgia today. At the same time there were 565 registered for the month of March.The trail, shelters,and campsites are going to be full. What they call the bubble is coming. More than half will not make it out of Georgia. That is one of the reasons I chose to start when I did. I can't imagine being with that many people on the trail. Put it this way this is the fifth day that I have hiked alone and have not seen anyone on the trail. I see others at camp but not on the trail. Ok enough of that. In my last post I said I was in a bunkroom and I had some critter activity on the ceiling. So at 1:00 this morning this thing comes back from being outside making a racket. It must of carried something back with it and couldn't fit through the hole. It sounded like if say you had a stick and you tried to get it through the hole horizontally instead of just pushing it though the opening. This went on for a few minutes. Then all the noise was happening in the ceiling. It was quieter at the shelter. Lol
I started out about 8:30 this morning in a drizzle. Soon the rain ended and it warmed up enough that I was hiking in a tee shirt. That lasted for about an hour until the cloud cover came in making it tough to see. Then it started pouring. That lasted on and off the remainder of the day. I got my first sighting of wildlife of any significance. About fifteen feet off the trail in some brush I startled three wild pigs. They took off running, one black one took off to the right and a grey and another black one to the left. I thought it was a bear at first being black then I saw the grey one. They scared the heck out of me. They were to fast to get any good pictures.
With all the rain the trail became very muddy and slick. Coming down one steep descend it was so bad that I fell twice in a matter of five minutes landing on my right wrist twice. All good. And I also had one good save.
In a previous post I said I was going to do the shelter experience if it was raining. Well I got to the shelter at 12:45, a little early to call it a day. Upon arriving I noticed mice droppings all around the floor and there was so much garbage by the privy (outhouse). It look like someone lugged a suitcase loaded with trash up the trail and dumped it. That could attract animals and rodents. I didn't want to be part of that. So I hiked 3 1/2 miles further to the nearest tent sites. Hopefully it doesn't rain over night. I think right now my tent should be dry seeing we are having some heavy winds. Jeremy and Julie are camping by the shelter tonight.
Why Not and Handstand are camping near me. Handstand may have to get off the trail for a few days, he has been experiencing shin splints and now has pain in his thigh. The nearest road is about four miles, he said he will see how it feels after that.
Another hiker (Two Tents) that Im friends with on facebook and also on these journals just ended his hike. He had some medical issues one being his blood pressure was rising. So for health purposes he shut it down. Hope all works out for you Paul. 
Tomorrow may be another 10 or so mile day as we are preparing our schedule for entering the Smoky's most likely on Tuesday.

Had breakfast and packed up all my belongings and wet tent. Started hiking at 9:45 with the sun shinning and a temperature of about 60 degrees. It was nice to have the sun beating down on my back. I even got to hang some of my wet clothes off the back of my pack to dry. The day was uneventful except for one climb that was called Jacob's Ladder an ascend of 600 ft in 0.6 of a mile. It was a butt kicker. It just went straight up. We are expecting rain overnight. With heavy rains expected tomorrow. I'm sleeping in a shelter with Handstand, Why Not, and a young guy named Matt.
I may not have good service from here on out for about 8 or so days. May have tonight. But I believe not through the Smoky's. Maybe once near Gatlinburg.

They were headed to the Fontana Lodge for a couple of days off so Handstand can rest his leg. I left camp around 9:00 as it was going to be a short day. The plan was to get to Fontana to resupply before entering the Smoky's. It was mostly a cloudy day with a little drizzle. I got a shuttle for my resupply, and while I shopped he waited to take me back. Not bad about an half hour roundtrip. As I was adding everything to my food bag the skies opened up. Luckily I only had amile to get to the shelter. Im at a shelter that sleeps twenty. It has an upper and lower section on each side. I have a top section to myself. There are seven of us tonight. This place has a water pump, a solar charging station, electric in the rest rooms and get this hot showers. It's called The Fontana Hilton.
It is supposed to rain changing to sleet and snow overnight low in the 30's. The next four days are going to be cooler with overnight temperatures in the teens. Tomorrow I enter the Smoky's. This will most likely be the last cell service I will have for the next week or so. I may have service somewhere half way through around Gatlinburg. I will write my journal each night and will post them when I have a signal. So if you see one post go to the previous there will probably be more. This coming week should be interesting.

About ten minutes later some of the guys were starting to get up. One by one everybody gathered their gear and had something to eat and headed out. I packed up and went up to the restrooms to charge my phone and powerpack. I left at 10:00 and made my way down a long paved road across the Fontana Dam. That was pretty cool. Once across I came upon a sign that said  Welcome to the Great Smoky Mountsins.Up a little further I entered the woods where there was a box to deposit half of my permit to enter. There was a dusting of snow on the trail. As I made my way to higher elevations the trail began to be covered. With all the snow on the trees it looked so beautiful. It was 9.9 miles to the first shelter. I want sure if I was going to stop there or go another 3.1 miles to the next one. Once upon arriving at the first one none of the other hikers were there. But what was there were some jeans hanging by the fireplace and some gear all spread out. I haven't seen any thru hiker wearing jeans. By ther way all the shelters in the Smoky's have fireplaces. I didn't have a good feeling about staying there. It looked like someone was squatting at the shelter. So I moved on to the next one while I still had enough light. There was talk this morning of some stopping at the second shelter. When I arrived no one was there and I didn't have enough time to get to the next one. So here I am by myself. It was cold, thank goodness there was a tarp put across the front to keep some of the wind out. I'm starting to hear the mice move about. I did 14.9 miles today. Day number seven hiking alone.

From the vistas it was so beautiful seeing all the snow on the trees in the distance. The temperature was in the low 30's but no wind. It was so cool walking the trail seeing all the snow shavings on the branches. They were actually shavings of ice. The water sources were hard to find. I found one that was at a trickle. I was afraid to use my filter on account of it possibly freezing up. If that happened I wouldn't know it and could be very bad health wise. So I used my backup, water purification tablets.
At night I put in my sleeping bag with me my filter, fuel, phone, and battery power pack. And even sometimes my boots in an oven roaster bag to prevent them from freezing. 
I fell again yesterday, this time on ice from all the runoff. I pushed my luck not wanting to stop and take out my micro spikes. After that fall they went on. I got to the shelter that I planning on stopping at about 3:30. Only to find a large bag of food and some clothes. The bag was partially busted open with some of the contents spilled out. I didn't have a good feeling about this shelter either, so I pushed on another 5.7 miles to the next one. During this time whatever water I had froze.I was really getting thirsty so I started eating the ice shavings from the branches. They were pretty refreshing. When I arrived at the shelter there was a young guy who is doing section hiking. Found out he is from Queens, N.Y. Together we had to fix the tarp that was up, there were just to many gaps so we had to tighten it up. The temperature for tonight is supposed to be 14° with a wind chill of minus 5°.

I really didn't want to get out of my bag, but Ieventually started to change and put things away. I couldn't feel my fingers. My boots were frozen, I couldn't get my feet in them. I would normally put a bottle in them to keep them open but I had my bottles in my sleeping bag to try to defrost them, that didnt help.
Two hikers stopped at the shelter, once I said my name he said he has been reading my journals. And he said they have inspired him. That's pretty cool. Oh and about a little over a week ago I was having lunch with Jeremy and Julie when we were leaving the restaurant a couple asked if we were thru hikers. When we said we were he said I looked familiar from my picture on my journal he had been reading. Now that's really cool. Celebrity status. Lol.
So today there were two milestones. I hiked to Clingmans Dome the highest elevation on the AT at 6658 ft. and at the same time I surpassed 200 miles. I fell on ice again and nope I didn't have my spikes on. You never know if you should put them on because usually it's only a short section of ice, so you tempt fate. It's just a pain to take off your pack get them out put them on, put your pack back on. So I just chance it. I guess not as much of a pain as I feel when I keep falling. Lol. I'm alone at the shelter again tonight. It's not as windy as last night but its still cold. As I did last night I have on my upper body a smartwool baselayer longsleeve shirt, a smartwool tee shirt, a 4.0 extreme cold Under Armour longsleeve shirt, a fleece, my puffy jacket, and a rain jacket.

I hiked 5 miles to Newfound Gap, it's a place where the tourists that are staying in Gatlinburg, Tennesse come to view the mountain ranges. This road is shut down quite frequently due to wind, ice, and snow. There were some hikers who went into Gatlinburg, which is 15 miles away, to resupply two days ago. Only to get stuck there when they closed the road. So yesterday they got a shuttle to the end of the Smoky's to hike southbound to Newfound Gap where they got off. And then got another shuttle back to the end of the Smoky's to continue hiking northbound. I saw them today and busted them that they were going the wrong way. What they were doing is called a flip flop. It's allowed as long as you cover all the miles. At Newfound Gap I had a signal so I called my wife Maureen to tell her where I was and that everything was going well. I also called one of my longest friends (Mouse) to wish him a Happy Birthday. We have been friends for 55 years. We make sure we call each other on our birthdays. I was glad I was able today as it was the only day I had service. As I was looking in my guide book to see where the trail picked up across the parking lot. Fresh Ground, from The Leap Frog Cafe, you remember him the angel of all trail angels, came over and said come have something to eat. That was awesome. He comes out of nowhere and the next thing you know I'm sitting down saying chicken soup, a banana, a piece of cake a donut, a cup of kool aid, and a Butterfinger to go. Now that's trail magic. What an experience. I was hungry and there was food. Thanks Fresh Ground. Check out his site ""Leap Frog Cafe"".
Today the views out did yesterday's. When I got to the shelter there was a couple, ""Better Together"", already there. I know her from the AT Facebook groups. And as I'm writing this another hiker comes in. It is already dark and could be quite dangerous with all the patches of ice.I should know I feel again. That's three days in a row again, and yeah I didn't have my spikes on, actually I took them off not long before. I think I had them on and off about eight times today. The hiker that just came in said there is a girl hiker coming to this shelter in about an hour and half from now. That's crazy she should have stopped at the shelter before this one.

I went and got my food bag of the bear cables and made breakfast right away. All the shelters have cables to hang your food so you don't have to hang it from a tree. The forcast turned out to be nice it was forcasted for rain. It drizzled a couple of times but not for long. I continued my joyous descent out of the Smoky's. It's not that disliked being in there it was challenging to say the least. It's just the matter of having to hike to any of the shelters. You have to stay in a shelter. I just like when I can plan on hiking to a tent campsite and set up my tent. If I want to stay in a shelter it's by my choice. But I do like the confines of my tent. Not someplace with eight other people snoring. I do enough of that on my own. Well upon exiting I turned around and gave the Great Smoky Mountains a friendly salute. Lol
Then I hiked two miles more to the Standing Bear Hostel. I rented the Creek House. It's a 10x12 room with a bed a tv that only plays dvd's, half of the cases are empty and an electric fireplace you know the one with the fake flames. Yeah and a creek run right outside my door.Oh and I forgot to mention there are lady bugs crawling all over the windows and ceiling. I tossed as many as I could out the door but there were sp many I gave up. I look at it this way.... I'm living in the woods with thousands of bugs and in shelters with mice I guess a few (well more than a few) ladybugs can't hurt.
Oh and I did laundry.......by hand they only have a dryer.
Oh and I took a shower, an ice cold one. But after nine days I didn't care.

I'm staying at a hostel tonight, I have a bunkroom that sleeps ten all to myself. There are two other thru hikers and a couple of section hikers down the hall. Tonight I met Eagle Scout, he signed in a position before me at the start of our thru hike last month. He and Wow, who I met on Saturday, went to a local tavern for dinner where we met Better Together, a couple I spent time with at two shelters in th Smoky's, and Hugs, another fellow I just met. We all had a good time sharing stories and many laughs. It's like I have known these people for quite some time but in all actually its just been a matter of days.
Tomorrow I plan on taking a zero. Good thing because after all of the descending again today my knees are feeling it. I would say out of the 13 miles 10 were going downhill. Sometimes uphill is so much easier on the body.
So tomorrow my plan is to get all my laundry done, by machine this time. Go to the outfitter and look to purchase a new rain jacket. Something that is more waterproof then the one I paid good money for at REI. Then to the Post Office to send home some stuff that I haven't used to help lighten the load. And to do a resupply.
But most of all to just relax with a day off. It's been 15 days since my last zero, 170 miles ago.

After that we all went to do a resupply. Then I went to the outfitter and got a new rain jacket. Then I went back to the hostel to relax a bit while the post office closed for lunch. Then went back to the Dollar General to pick up a few more items and to grab a box to ship a few things home that I didn't need. Whatever I lost in weight on the shipment home I doubled in my food resupply. Lol. My pack is way heavy again. I can't wait until the weather turns warmer so I can get rid of some of the heavy clothes. Then went back and got some laundry done and hung out with some new guys that came in. The new guys are Santa, Lucky and Catmando. All cool guys. Then before we knew it we went back to the restaurant for dinner. Wow the day went so fast.
On another note for over the past two weeks I have had a numbness on the outside of my left leg. That doesn't concern me as much as this new issue. I'm hoping it's just from all the downhills lately.

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608102,"After having a somewhat restless night.I got up in the morning feeling achy. I walked down the hall in somewhat discomfort. The pain was just shooting down my leg. As much as I didn't want to have to do it, I decided that the best thing to do was take another zero. I did about an hour of stretching then hiked up about a half mile of the AT that is literally in the backyard of the hostel. Last night at dinner I was talking to Britta (Better Together) and she suggested that if I am going to be doing any long downhills to a lengthen my treking poles so I am as not so hunched over. So on that little test run today I tried it and my leg didn't bother me. As to the question George Devine asked on my guest book. I have a herniated and a degenerated L4-L5. I have been seeing a chiropractor weekly for over two years and it has been working. I did feel a twindge a couple of weeks back but nothing to this extent. I think with the two days of downhills exiting the Smoky's and about the ten or so miles of downhill entering Hot Springs has brought it on. So hopefully rest and continued extra stretching may alleviate it. My plan is to rest up and get back out there tomorrow. I like this little town and the restaurants. They seem to serve generous portions to us hikers.They are a hiker town and seem to appreciate us being here. Maybe now seeing that they have not yet endured the bubble. That is the mass of probably the couple of thousand of hikers that will be passing through in the coming weeks. They are calling for some heavy rain overnight ending late morning.

The only reason I woke up when I did was because one of the guys leaned on my mattress to unplug his phone. I should really have some one wake me up when I have them in.Well after two days rest I got back out there. Everthing went well with my leg. I was pleased with that. It was about a half mile walk through town on the AT. Then it went down along a river bank before turning into the woods and a steep climb up the mountain overlooking the river and the tiny town of Hot Springs N.C. I really enjoyed my stay there. I took it easy at first, still a little nervous if the pain would come back. After about six miles of pretty much all climbs I started to feel more comfortable. I m another hiker on the trail today, he was taking a rest standing on the side. We introduced ourselves. His name is Fireman, he recently retired from the fire department.  I would see him a couple more times once when I took a break and again when he was taking another break. We agreed on meeting at the shelter. When I got there it was a mess. There were tarps a sleeping bag, a tent and all sorts of trash lying about. Another one of those it looks like a squatter might have been living there. Even off the bear cable was a recycled shopping bag loaded with who lnows what. Neither of us planned on sleeping in the shelter. We were goingto sleep in our tents, but the only flat spots were right behind the shelter. And tonight it's going down to 30 with gusts at 35 and the wind would be blowing right at the back of the shelter. Also seeing the shelter is at a high elevation we thought it would be wise to seek a stealth campsite at a lower elevation. So we decided to head out and found one about a mile and a half away. It was nice to have someone if not to hike with at least to sit at the end of the day and talk to and have dinner with.I'm happy with what I accomplished today. The legs felt fine. If I couldnt find a stealth site I probably would have pushed on to the next shelter which was over 8 miles away. If that happened it would have been close to a 20 mile day. Not sure if that would have been a wise choice. We'll see maybe tomorrow, it looks like that maybe in the cards. Tonight I am safe and warm in my tent.","Laughing Heart Hostel

The Hankster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608269,"Last night the wind was howling. I kept hearing branches falling. I just prayed that one wouldn't fall on my tent. I got up just before dawn and grabbed Fireman's and my food bag from the bear line. It was about 30° and very windy. I hustled back into my tent and got back in my bag to warm up. Had a poptart and slowly made progress of getting my day started. I left camp about 9:00, planning on a 14 mile day.
But then it started again, for about the past two weeks I am going over and over in my head if I really want to continue my thru hike. Physically I am ok for the most part. My left leg gets a tingling numbness all the time now. And my right leg has on and off affects of my old sciatica issues. That so far I have been getting by with. But mentally I'm not to good. I guess when you are out here all alone for hours on end and being like that for days and even weeks. It can get the best of you. So this morning heading out I was in a funk. I want to continue but I also want to pull the plug. I hiked this morning 3.5 miles to a gravel road that had a hostel on it at the end. I made a left onto the road and headed to the hostel. I have come to terms with myself. If I didn't get off there I would only drag on the inevitable. I have been thinking of doing this for some time now. I would take a mental break for a day or two only to fall back into the same state.
This thru hike is the hardest thing I have ever tried to do. They say it is 10% physical and 90% mental. And let me tell you they are totally right. In the beginning it was all new to me. Sure I have hiked before. Some day hikes, some three to four day trips. But to be out doing it day after day it wears on you. I got through all that never ending rain. I got through the freezing cold Smoky's. I got by all the exhaustion and aches. But the one thing I couldn't get by was the mental toughness. Of what the trail does to you mentally. When I saw a big climb I would be crap can I even get up there. And I did. Many, many times. But those many times got to be harder and harder. I all along had trouble with the big climbs, maybe not so much early in the day but after a few hours I would be sucking wind. I would stop in mid climb for about 30 seconds to rest and get some air in my lungs. This got frustrating that it kept going on, and the more it happened the more the mind was working against me. I got to the point in my head that this wasn't going to get any better. I am mentally spent.
In the 36 days that I have been out here, 32 of them hiking, I have done 291.2 miles plus the 8.8 mile approach trail for a total exactly and ironically an even 300 miles. I am quite proud of that. On the otherside I am disappointed that I am not continuing on. They say that only about 20 to 25 percent of the three to four thousand that start make it. Damn I wanted to be in that 25% column. All I know is that when I look in the mirror I can see someone who gave it his all. And YES I AM VERY PROUD OF THAT. I hope everybody understands what I'm going through. I know people will be disappointed in not being able to read my daily journal. I hear it has been a morning ritual whether it being on a bus commute, or sitting at the counter with their morning coffee. I'm sorry.
There are so many people I would like to thank but to many to name.
 But mostly importantly I want to thank my wife Maureen for her unending love and support in letting me go to try fulfill my dream. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! To my daughters Beki and Bri, thanks for believing in me and encouraging me along. I LOVE YOU GUYS!
