Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606618,Today I finished by first blog post to be submitted to All Women All Trails.  I had to take care of setting up this trail journal as well so I could include a link to it.  Now I'm waiting for my requested direct link URL.  I plan on using this trail journal to log details of my preparation for my upcoming thru hike and to keep track of the actual hike.  I will be exploring topics in a more organized fashion in my blog posts.  I'll include links as they get published.,,View Entry,"Jan 26, Sat",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606676,"Snowshoed to the Pinnacle Mountain ice wall.  7.5 miles.  About 1/3 of it was breaking trail.  Luckily there were 3 of us so we shared that responsibility.  Had my full pack with me today (minus food).  Overall, I can say I felt fine.  The pack rides well (even after about 7 hours in the woods... about an hour of that without the pack on).  I do have to remember to put a bandana in my 'kitchen' kit so I have something to hold that hot handle with!",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Sun",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606677,"I got my link confirmed to this trail journal today!  Hurrah!  I was just waiting on that to complete my bio for the blog.  I sent both the first blog submission and my bio in today!  As those blog posts get published, I have to put a link to them here. My plan is to blog every couple of weeks on the trail.  I'm going to start that routine now. It's all a learning process that I'm having fun doing.  Also did a series of yoga hip exercises.  I’ll be doing those on a regular basis now.  Hip stability seems like a good idea to me.",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Mon",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606699,"I'm having a hell of a time deciding if I want a sleeping bag liner.  I am using a sleeping quilt as opposed to a sleeping bag.  I was thinking a liner might be nice for warmer weather.  It also would keep my quilt clean.  AND it would add a couple of degrees to the quilt if need be.  The problem is that they are all like big socks.  I'm not sure I want to wriggle into a liner.  I'm also not so sure I need  a couple of degrees for my bag.  I can always wear more clothes.  I also tend to sleep warm.  So... maybe I should just save the weight (which would be somewhere between 4-8 oz) and wash my quilt when I get home....  
Otherwise, today, I sorted out how to insert photos and captions into the blog and contacted AWAT with that info for the first post.  They seem to be excited about my work so far.  
I created a list of potential future blog posts... in case I get writer's block!I would love to hear what any of my readers have to say about liners or topics for a blog.... be sure to sign my guestbook with ideas!",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Tue",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606753,"This past week has been the first week of the spring semester at the community college I teach at.  I've been telling my students that I'm retiring and going to hike the AT.  Today's group of Environmental Science students was super interested.  A couple of them want to come along :).  In general, I've been finally telling lots of folks that I'm going to do this. Just voicing it makes it so real! I'm also trying to get some first hand accounts of the trail.  I'm meeting up (this weekend) with one of the folks that used to work at the college that retired in 2012 and completed a thru hike that year with his wife.  I've been in contact with my mailman.  He completed the trail in 2018.  And I've got one other friend that did about 1000 miles several years ago.  I'm working on getting in touch with him.  I figure, the more I can find out from folks that I know (and know me) the better prepared I'll be.I'm also reading a bunch of blogs and trail journals, listening to a bunch of podcasts and keeping tabs on a bunch of facebook groups (mostly lurking...).Yesterday and today were yoga days.  I finally went to a vinyasa class last night.  Taught 2 classes today and then did a hip series that also strengthens the hip flexors and hamstrings.  Working on stability.",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Thu",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606770,"Today I found out about the Allpoint app thanks to the facebook group: Appalachian Trail: Women's Group.  The app shows you all the ATMs that don't have a service charge!  It also determines if your debit card qualifies for the free service.  As it turns out mine does.  Hurray!  So, of course, I installed the app.I had been wondering how I was going to deal with getting cash.  I am not a regular ATM user.  I tend to use a credit card for everything. That said, I know that I will need to have some cash on me and resupplying that was a concern (though a very minor one).I know that I can also ask for cash back at some stores when using my credit card.  So between the debit card and the credit card I should be all set.I will have to remember to let the credit card folks know I'll be traveling.  I'm actually really good at that because Jim and I have made several long road trips around the country and I have had to keep the bank informed of where we were.For paying bills I already do almost all of it online through the credit union.  Thank goodness they have a mobile app where I can continue to do that.  I'll just have to get Jim to let me know about the odd bill that comes in that is still paid the old fashioned way.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Fri",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606790,"The AWOL guides came today!  I purchased both the NOBO and SOBO editions.  My friend Mar gave me the Thru-Hiker's Companion for my birthday.  So now I'm all set!  I've been practicing reading all the symbols and ""planning""  what my first 3 days might look like.  Actually, I don't really plan on a lot of planning (can you tell 'plan' is a favorite activity of mine??).  I'd rather let each day play out as it may.  One of my goals is to NOT plan so much during this adventure. That said... the plan is to bring about 1/4 of the NOBO AWOL guide with me to start.  I'll let Jim use the Thru-hiker's companion from home to live the trail vicariously.  He'll mail or deliver the rest of the NOBO guide when I need it.  Then I'll pick up the SOBO guide when I get back to Harper's Ferry.  My niece is planning on hiking a bit with me when I start SOBO so I can mail that next section to her.",,View Entry,"Feb 02, Sat",0

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606889,No huge milestones the last few days.  I have been doing yoga every day.  I found a terrific foot and lower leg routine on Yoga International.  I'm incorporating that stuff into my yoga practices.  It is amazing how much work the lower leg does to control the feet.  I'm feeling this is super good training for the trail.,,View Entry,"Feb 06, Wed",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606968,"I've been remiss at keeping up with this journal.  That just means I've been super busy... too busy to open the darned computer.  Here are some things that pertain to the hike that have occurred in the past few days.
1) the AT poster (18""x48"") came.  Jim loves it.  He is going to mount it on a ceiling tile so he can put pins in to keep track of where I am.
2) I sent my second blog into the AWAT folks.  Still waiting for the inaugural issue of this venture.  They did just form the AWAT writers guild which I am part of.  So things are happening!
3) I went for a 6.2 mile snowshoe to Jockeybush and Iron lakes.  We bushwacked most of the way.  First to avoid a stream crossing.  The water is relatively high for this time of the year due to a recent rain storm and not quite enough cold enough weather to freeze up all that water.  We were hesitant to get our snowshoes and/or feet wet on the way out.  The hike from Jockeybush to Iron was a complete bushwack as there is not trail there.  On the way back we took the actual trail from Jockeybush out.  We could do that because we crossed the frozen lake.  That did mean we had to ford that stream.  We all managed to do that without getting wet.  It was close to the end of the trail so it would not have mattered anyway.  I carried about 22# on this trek.  No problem at all with the weight either on the day of or the day after that hike.
4)I ordered my starter pair of trail runners (Altra Lone Peak 3.5).  There was a really good deal ($66) on Amazon.  I hiked with this style/model of shoe all last summer and was very pleased with the results.  So I will start the AT with these.
So... I've been keeping up with preparations!",,View Entry,"Feb 11, Mon",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607073,Finally a day I could walk after work!  Took a 5.4 miles road walk.  No pack today just walking fast.  Just over 15 minute miles.  Then I fashioned a wallet out of some scrap Silnylon and a random zipper I had laying around.  It’s less than 0.25oz.  I put a loop on it so I could clip it to a pack or belt loop or something. I figured the loop couldn’t hurt.,,View Entry,"Feb 15, Fri",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607130,"Snowshoe to the top of the hill here at home today.  It was a 1.5 mile - breaking trail all the way - day.  I've got a good path on this side of the property.  Next trip I'll try to do the same on the other side.  Then I might get a 3 mile walk in right here.
Saturday I was cross country skiing with Terry.  First time on skis in a long time.  It was beautiful.  Broke trail for about 0.5 miles... but it was easy going.
I took the time today to put almost all my gear into lighter pack.  Check out my list (that is still evolving) here: https://lighterpack.com/r/29qgI ordered a pair of icebreaker 150 merino baselayer leggings, a purple rain hiking skirt and a couple pair of exofficio underwear bottoms.  I've almost got my clothing figured out (provided everything I ordered fits well).I've been really wondering about rain pants.  My marmots are 10oz.  I was thinking I might go with a rain skirt/kilt.  But that would mean I'd need a different pair of pants of some sort.  I want some wind resistant thing in case I hit cold weather on mountain tops and in exposed places (read Whites here).  I know it can be cold up there even in the summer.  My rain paints can double as wind pants... or pants in general if I need them.  I weighed my zip off nylon pants and they came in over 12 oz.  So ... I'm sticking with the rain pants right now.  I'm settling in on hiking in a skirt.  I've done that before and LOVED it.  The purple rain has big pockets so I won't have to have a fanny/belt pack for the phone and a couple of snacks.  I like that.  I also like the idea of putting a wet/damp skirt on a lot better than putting on wet shorts...  Let's hope I like the way it fits.Current base weight is 17.72 pounds.  The only 2 things that will add substantially are the icebreaker leggings and camp shoes.  I'll add the leggings as soon as they arrive.  I'm up in the air about camp shoes.  I do want something that I can use as shower shoes as well as camp shoes.  I've heard the Walmart 'crock' knock offs are light and serviceable.  I really hate flip flops.  I thought I'd also look at a slide-like shoe.  I wish my Chacos weren't so heavy... I take them in a heart beat!  Overall, I'd like to get base weight as close to 15 pounds as possible.  I'll be working to cut out some weight.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Mon",0

ACK!  its up to 18 pounds.  I'm going to have to make some hard decisions over the next couple of months.  This light pack thing is a challenge!  Good thing I like challenges.",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Wed",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607324,Sue and I hiked (with microspikes) about a 3 mile section up Bromley Mtn in the afternoon.  We were on our way to a VT weekend of snowshoeing/skiing/hiking depending on the trail conditions.  It was good to get out in the woods and see white blazes that I'll see again this summer,,View Entry,"Feb 22, Fri",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607325,"5 of us needed microspikes today on the hike up Ascutney Mtn.  We did a thru over the mountain (leaving a car at either end).  We ascended on the Weatherfield trail and came down the Windsor Trail.  About 6 miles total.  2263' elevation gain on the way up and another 2555' on the way down.  
There was good snow cover but the trail was packed down from both snowshoers and recent rain that froze the trail up.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Sat",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607327,"Mostly on snowmobile trails with microspikes today (still at Ascutney).  Out for a couple of hours.  It was sleeting/raining lightly but not enough to deter us.  
Got home (3 hour drive) mid afternoon.  My order of mini carabiners came in so now I have lots of ways to attach things to my pack.  We also received a set of pushpins so Jim can keep track of where I am on the trail!",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Sun",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607550,"Current base weight is at 16.5 pounds.  I ditched the umbrella.  I purchased a Toaks titanium 650ml pot which is much lighter than the aluminum grease pot I was using.  I also traded out a heavy multitool for a light set of scissors (so I can cut things like KT tape), deleted the sawyer backflush plunger and slimmed down my first aid kit and miscellaneous items.The purple rain skirt came in and fits perfectly.  I love the fabric... light and fast drying.  I think I'll really like hiking in that.I have a few things left to add (most notably camp shoes and a light weight pair of shorts to sleep in)  and I'll probably still do some tweaking.  It's unlikely I'll get down to my goal weight of 15 pounds without changing out my pack... which I am not doing.  I really love my pack and believe the good fit more than compensates for the extra pounds.  All that said, I'm very happy with the weight at this point.The whole kit can be viewed at lighter pack here: https://lighterpack.com/r/29qg...I wrote a 3rd blog post for All Women All Trails.  I'm really hoping they get to publishing the first one soon!  I'd like to be able to roll out that info.Finally, I ascertained that I'll be able to get a doxycycline prescription (for potential Lyme disease infection) from my Nurse Practitioner before I leave.  That is comforting!",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Sun",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607877,"Not much to report this week.  I try to get either a yoga practice or a walk in every day.  Finally there is enough light when I get home from work to be able to walk (at least on some days).  After today, and the clock change, I expect I'll be walking a lot more.  I think I've reviewed my gear list a bajillion times.... and I really like it.  It all seems super reasonable to me.  I've got very few ways to reduce it from the current 16.5#.  One is change out my pack.  I've looked at some of the lighter Ospreys.  I've thought about one of the ultralight packs.  Without actually trying one, I'm hesitant to buy one.  I've decided to visit some gear outlets along the trail and try some other packs as I go.  If one really speaks to me, I'll purchase it then and sent the current one home.I've also been contemplating leaving the kindle at home and just using the kindle app on my phone.  That would save 6.25oz... which is pretty substantial.  I do wonder just how much time I'll have to read on the trail.  Many people say they start with the kindle and then send it home.  If time is limited, I won't mind doing a small bit of reading on the phone.  I am worried about my phone battery.  My phone seems to act up and lose battery life quickly at time.  I have to do some more experiments.  The other day I thought I put it on airplane mode and took a walk for 1.25hrs ... listening to a podcast the whole way.  The phone quit even though I thought I had close to 70% charge.  I need to do some serious experimenting to see if its the user or the phone...  If I have to change out the phone before I go, I'll do that.I also have to try out my sleeping bag liner.  If I left that out I'd save another 5.2 oz.  So together with the kindle, that's almost 12oz.... closing in on 1#.  That's a lot!!Waiting certainly makes your mind do lots of gymnastics!",,View Entry,"Mar 10, Sun",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608270,My first blog post for All Women All Trails has been posted.  It's called Passage to the Precipice and documents how I made the decision to thru hike.  I'll be writing regularly for that group so go ahead and subscribe!  Make sure to leave a comment so I know you were there.Been thinking through the what to wear as a bra on the trail.  This has been somewhat of a chore as I have never been able to find a sports bra that I was comfortable in... or did not give me a uniboob.  I just found another company that people rave about called True & Co.  I'm going to give them a try and see if I can find something that I can wear with or without a shirt (hot days or swimming...)It's spring break for me this week so I've upped the training regiment.  Getting a 5.25 mile walk in daily.  Yesterday I also did a couple miles on snow shoes in the afternoon.  I'm trying to be very mindful of getting my feet into shape so they are used longer days holding me up.Still waiting on my quilt from Enlightened Equipment.  Its been 6-7 weeks since ordering.  I'm guessing I'm going to hear from them soon.  Can't wait! ,,View Entry,"Mar 17, Sun",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608330,"Another trek to the ice wall in Bleecker.  Wore my full pack as training... about 20 pounds.  Did the first mile with microspikes then switched to snow shoes for the remainder of the day.  Total of 5 miles.  These treks are feeling really good.  It feels like an easy day.  We did not do much elevation gain.... just a few hundred feet total.  I'm sure that will make a huge difference.  Right now, I'm just pleased that I have not lingering feet or leg issues.  I followed this up with an hour yoga practice aimed at legs and back strength along with balance.  Again, feels good and not overly challenging.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Mon",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608674,"The last 2 days have been soooo exciting.  Last night I met up with thru-hikers Tree Trunk and Manula for fantastic dinner conversation.  They shared their album, slide show, stories and experience.  I was very inspired.  When they were getting ready to leave, Tree Trunk pulled out a brand new GraniteGear Blaze 60 that he had gotten as a replacement for one that broke and gave it to me to try!  After they left I fiddled around with all the adjustments and went online to see how to fit the pack appropriately.  I haven't loaded it up yet but it seems like it might work out fantastically.  AND it shaves another 11oz off my base weight!  They left me with a box full of books to comb through... VERY inspiring.  This definitely feels like pre-trail magic!... and in keeping with the adage: 'the trail provides'.  
My base weight is now down to 15.48#.  I removed the kindle and decided I'd read on my phone.  That helped bring the weight down a bit as well.  This weight is without the umbrella (12oz) which I'm still wishy-washy about bringing.
Today I had lunch with another AT hiker, Juice.  He shared stories of the trail and his experience.  He is currently prepping for the PCT.  It was fun and exciting to get yet another perspective on long-distance hiking.
This week I did a phone/battery pack experiment.  I started last Saturday morning  with a full battery on both my iphone and on the Anker 10,000.  I kept my phone on airplane mode usually but used it whenever I wanted to (taking it off airplane mode as needed).  I only charged with the battery pack.  My phone was fully charged every morning except this morning (a whole week later).  Today it only made it to 60%.  The take-away from this experiment is that I think I have plenty of charging capacity.  My next experiment is to see how fast the kindle app drains the battery (being mindful of the screen brightness).
Finally, my Enlightened Equipment down quilt (20F) came this week.  My gear is pretty much dialed in.  It's getting real!

I've been fiddling with my gear list and I'm now at 16# with the umbrella.  I still have to add a couple of clothing items.  I did purchase a small pouch to put my hip belt so I have easy access to my phone and a few snacks.  I rigged up a shoulder holder for a smart water bottle.  Tomorrow I'll give the base weight pack along with lunch and water a trial run to see how this new pack rides on the trail.

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611074,"Took my second hike with the Blaze 60 pack.  Overlook Mtn is a 5-mile in and back.  It’s all uphill on the way in and all down on the way out.  I loaded the pack with about 18lbs again.  Again, it feels great.  So I’m definitely starting out with this pack.
Yesterday I ordered a 2L Cnoc bladder for pre filtered water.  I also ordered the coupling for the sawyer so I can use a smart water bottle to back flush it.  My plan is to take the Cnoc, a 1L and a 750ml smartwater bottle.  That way I’ll have enough capacity to fill up before camping at night so I have enough water for evening and morning.
I came across a recipe for diy electrolyte powder (4 parts baking soda, 1 part Epsom salts, 1 part Morton’s Lite Salt - per 1/2 tsp: 372.5 mg sodium 87.5 mg potassium 30 mg magnesium).  I’ve been trying it out.  1/2tsp in 1 pint water is barely noticeable.  If I put that same amount in peppermint tea with honey it reminds me of Gatorade (which I hate!).  So the lesson is to just drink it plain in water.
I did set a date!!  I’ll leave home on May 15.  We’ll spend a little time with niece Mandy and hit the trail soon afterwards.  
Only 13 more days of school!  It’s all getting real!",,View Entry,"Apr 21, Sun",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612672,"Its been a couple of weeks since I updated the journal here.  This time of the semester is always a bit busy for me and because it is my last semester working, I've been busy cleaning out my office so that I'll be completely done this Wednesday May 8!  I leave for the AT on May 15.  I'll spend a couple of days with my neice in VA then arrive in Harper's Ferry on May 17.  Between now and then will be a whorl wind.
I finally registered for my hike with the ATC on April 26.  So I'm feeling all official.
I completed another blog post that was published.  Here is the link to that: https://www.allwomenalltrails.com/packing-my-fears-part-1-the-big-three/  and I just finished yet another that I'll send off tonight.
I went to see my nurse practitioner and she gave me a prescription for doxycycline in case of Lyme disease.  I thought that would be a good idea and so did she.  She also insisted on giving me a prescription for cephalexin in case of UTI or skin infection.  I'm probably not going to bring this prescription with me.  I've only ever had 1 UTI in my life (though it was recently) and I never get skin infections.  If either of those happen, neither is life threatening to start with and I'll have Jim send it along if I need it.
I did purchase an Ursack and OpSack odor proof liners.  Though originally I thought I'd be hanging a bear bag nightly, I decided to be a bit more smart about it and get something that was bear proof but lighter than my bear canister.  There are so many people on the AT now and there are plenty of bears.  The adage is ""a fed bear is a dead bear"" and I don't want a bad bear bag hang of mine to introduce a bear to the joys of raiding camp.  It'll also be easier to find a good place to secure the Ursack than fiddling with hanging a bag at night.
I stopped at Salvation Army and found a decent pair of shorts to sleep in.  They're just an athletic style that are lightweight and polyester so they'll dry fast if I choose to rinse them out in a stream or sink rather than launder them.
My friends have been giving me journal books to document my hike.  I think I'm up to 5 of them now!  My plan is to use them one at a time.. figuring I'll probably fill them fairly quickly as there will be plenty to write about on the trail.  I can use those scribblings as fodder for keeping this journal up to date with where I'm at and the highlights of what I've been up to.
One friend gave me a 'kit' that included neosporin + pain relief spray in a travel size which is awesome.  In that same kit was doTerra deep blue for sore muscles.  I'll definitely bring that!
I did another hike with the Blaze pack.  This time I packed it with my actual sleeping quilt, tent, clothes, kitchen kit, repair kit, first aid... in short just about everything I'm taking with me... plus food and water for the day.  Dan and I were going to hike up Kaaterskill High Peak but were stymied when we got to the 'road closed' sign.  I guess they close the road for the winter and April 27 was still 'winter' there.  So, instead, we walked the escarpment trail at north-south lake.  It was a perfect day to view Kaaterskill falls.  It did snow on us!  and the sun shone!... so a bit of all weather.  The pack performed flawlessly for this 7 mile hike. Otherwise, I've been walking 5.25 miles just about every day.  Yoga on the off days.  
I've also been thinking about electrolytes.  I hate gatorade so I did a search to see if I could find a recipe for electrolyte powder and make my own.  I did find one that consisted of baking soda, morton's lite salt and epsom salts.  I made it up and tried it in water.  It's ok but not something I'd go out of my way to drink.  So I tried it in a mint tea with honey.  Oh my goodness, it had the exact flavor in it that I hate in gatorade.  So I learned that it must be the sugar with the salt that turns me off.  Then I went online to look at the sodium, potassium and magnesium content in gatorade and pedialyte.  I thought I could make up my own concoction.  What I came up with is a mix of 1 part each sea salt, Morton's lite salt and epsom salt.  Using 1/4 tsp of this in 1 pint to 1 liter of water will give me 229mg sodium, 117mg potassium and 42mg magnesium.  I think that's a pretty good suite of electrolytes.  The other important one is calcium that I'll be getting with a supplement that I'll be taking.  So I'm going to make up some of this powder to take with me and use it to start with.
I tried some other products out to see if I like them.  Badia brand puts out a dehydrated kale that is terrific!  They also make dehydrated honey (which is really a sugar/honey mix).  I liked that as well.  So my first food supply will include these.  I found Starbucks VIA instant coffee and had read that its not bad for instant.  I tried it and am happy enough with it to give up bringing the coffee cone that I originally thought I'd bring.  That will save having to bring filters and packing out the used grounds.
You can see I've been busy.  I'll try to keep this journal up more religiously going forward. ...though no guarantees until I'm actually on the trail!",,View Entry,"May 06, Mon",0
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613541,"My good friend Sue and I did a shake down hike Sunday and Monday.  I wanted to test my gear kit to see if I had everything I needed.  We decided to hike the tongue mountain range overlooking lake george.  Of course the weather was looking cold and wet.  We hoped to avoid hiking in the rain.
We met at the trailhead at 11AM on Sunday.  Immediately I realized I had left my trekking poles at home. Rats!  Well this is what a shakedown is all about!
I picked up a single walking stick at the trail register kiosk and made do with that.
We hiked up to just shy of the lean to on fifth peak.  Knowing there would be no water for the rest of the day and through the next morning, I filled up my 1 liter smartwater bottle and the 2 liter cnoc.  Adding 6 # to the pack weight was super obvious!  
We took a lunch break at the lookout then got back on the trail.  We weren’t sure where we’d camp.  We still thought it would rain and considered hiking until the rain was over.
After a couple of hours and 3 more peaks we found ourselves at the top of French mountain. Stunning views and a perfect camp site.  We were 5 miles along and thought that was a good enough distance for the day.  That left 8 miles and only 1 peak left.
Some notes on gear:
- tent was fine for 2 people with packs in the vestibules.  No condensation with doors open...even with 1 vestibule closed
- my $8.88 Walmart sandals are good camp shoes
- I don’t need a separate cup.  I had no problem eating and drinking with just my cook pot.
- my cook pot cozy also works as a cozy for ziplock bag cooking
- love my purple rain skirt.  It was really easy to put on a base layer and/or rain pants under it.
- my 20 degree enlightened equipment quilt was toasty warm.  I think the temp dipped below 40.  
Somehow we got no rain!  I told Sue we were facing east so should see the sunrise.  She laughed as it was supposed to be cloudy.  Well, we did see the sun briefly as it shown under the clouds!  The whole thing was stunning.
Packed up early to beat the rain.  Hiked to mont calm point for a 2nd breakfast.  Then along the lakeshore to another point for lunch.  We were back in the parking lot by 2:30 with no rain!
Fabulous hike.  I’d recommend that loop.  Sue and I definitely will do this again.

He also told me of an incident that happened at the next shelters coming up (where I had planned to stay). The short story is that a food bag was stolen at the Kirkridge shelter.  There were 2 odd hikers ( one in blue Jean cargo pants and cowboy boots, the other carrying a lot of zip ties) that were suspected.  I had been warned of this in an text from Swiss Opa.

The walk along the ridge had views for a long ways.  The site was an old zinc mine that is being ecologically restored. It actually did not look bad at all.  I was really tempted to pick some nettles (the first I’ve seen on the trail) but I don’t know if they bioaccumulate zinc... and I didn’t take the chance.
I walked at a slower pace today to save my feet for the long haul.  Johnny Walker and Muffet cached some water at a road crossing ( they were slack-packing this section).  That was super helpful. They also told me of another water cache at Smith Gap.  So water was not an issue in this dry stretch.  Just before that gap, I passed the 2 sketchy hikers going SOBO.  I was only about 4 miles from the Leroy shelter and I made the decision to go farther.
Just before seeing these guys I had met Sir Stops A Lot.  Another retiree that was section hiking. We had discussed the incident.  He knew the guy who had his food bag stolen ( including his white or kitchen).  He also was leary if staying at the next shelter. Once I saw the characters, I thought I’d leave him a cryptic note in the shelter log.  When I got to the shelter, there was no log so I had no way of contacting him.
When I did get to that shelter I saw 3 deer. They were just foraging.  They seemed not to care about me at all.  I went down to the spring to get water and while I was there a black-and-White warbler landed just a foot from me followed by a red-eyed vireo.  It was like the creatures of the woulda were showing me that all was well.
On my way out of the shelter area, I saw two more very peaceful deer.
I finally arrive at a great campsite with a great view.  When I got there I had multiple texts and a voicemail fromJohnny Walker and Muffet because they had seen those 2 guys as well .  I called nd reassured them I was fine.  I did hide my food bag that night just in case.","Campsite at mile 1258.9

After they left I had lunch and Smat ( the ridge runner) showed up.  He hiked with me the rest of the way out to DWG.  I found out that ridge runners pick up trash ( which is why the trail really is spotless), they clip branches the grow into the trail, they inform other trail crews if there are trees across the trail, and they talk to hikers both to teach and as ambassadors for the trail.  My hike with Smat made the rest of the day go quickly!  I got to DWG a day early and went to stay with my old college roommate Kathrine.","Campsite at mile 1277.8

I went over Bear Mtn and then through the zoo.  It was a sad little place. The interpretive signs along the trail were well done but the caged animals were in very small quarters and did not seem happy.
Walked over the Bear Mtn bridge over the Hudson River.  That was amazing.  
In the woods the Mountain laurel is still spectacular.
Eventually made it to the Appalachian marketplace... a deli and small supermarket.  I got an eggplant wrap that was delicious! Did my resupply and the. Got some fruit salad and hard boiled eggs to pick out for dinner.  It was only another mile to the campsite.

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617146,"It rained overnight so I packed up a wet tent.  Luckily we had the pavilion to use for breakfast. I left early to try to beat the forecasted rain.
The rain overnight made for a wet trail.  Hiked for awhile with Papa John talking about the history of the area.  There are lots of stone walls.  Mostly these were built to get the stones out of the fields.  We came to a stone foundation that was where George Washington had kept horses that were used to make a vaccine for smallpox.  It was very interesting.
We also trekked over an old mining ‘road’. It was probably more like a cart path.  It was pretty elaborate with stone walls
Holding the roadbed up so that it had a gradual change in elevation.  I think the mines were all iron mines used to make stuff for both the revolutionary war and the civil war.
Very interesting day on the trail!
I got to try out my new rain kilt for the last hour or so and it worked great.  My skirt stayed dry!
When we got to the park, we made the mistake of setting up the tents in the beach.  We did go up to the concession stand and had veggie burgers, fries and orange juice.  The veggie burgers were fantastic ... with real vegetables in them!  I also had an ice cream sandwich.
When we got back to the tents, we were told we had to maybe them to another location ( which was like 0.25 miles away!) At least it was a nice grassy spot.  It started raining as soon as I got in my tent.","Graymoor spiritual life center

First we climbed Shenandoah Mtn.    There is a painted flag on the track up there commemorating 9/11.
Then we stopped at the RPH shelter for a snack.  This shelter is a brick building where one wall has been removed.  There are bunks and a nice little porch. There’s also hiker feet sticking down from the ceiling!
After a lot of ups and downs (239 floors worth!) we made it to the Stormville deli.  I laid my tent a quilt out in the sun ( the tent got a lot of condensation last night due to being on wet grass.  So my quilt got pretty damp.
Then I bought a fabulous eggplant sandwich on a giant onion roll.  Had Doritos and a Bali Sri k to go along.  And of course finished that up with an ice cream sandwich!
Much of the trail was easy walking today.  In some places the rocks had been removed from the trail. Quite a change from PA!
We did pass through an area that had a tornado last year.  There were hundreds of large oak trees that had been uprooted or snapped off.  The trail has been rerouted through the tangle of trees.

My first feature was Great Falls.  There were lots of people swimming in the pool at the bottom.  Some were sliding down the falls.

Found trail magic at the parking area in Salisbury.  Had a cookie, Doritos and Mountain Dew.  Met Fancy Free, Maple leaf and her dog yankee and saw Diamond Blue again.

Hard day today.  I climbed over Bear Mtn, Mt Race, Mt Everett and down Jug end. All of it challenging.  I originally planned to go a few more miles but when I came off Jug End, I was whooped and I still had 4.5 miles to get to anywhere.  I called Jess Treat who runs a hostel.  She had room so I told her I’d be out to the road by 5...figuring I’d take my time.  Well the mosquitoes were so bad I practically ran out and got to the road at 4:20!
The views from the mountains were really spectacular today , especially from Race Ledges. I could see all the way to Mt Greylock.
I stopped for lunch at a nice overlook that has a stone shelter and a bench! I sat in the grass in the shade and had the view to myself.  I could hear hikers going by but no one knew enough to stop!  Just as I was packing up 2 guys walked up the road to this spot.  They told me there was trail magic about 1/2 mile down.  So off I went!
Casper the friendly ghost had his trail magic van in the parking area.  He does trail magic up and down the AT.  I met Honeybun there and he said he had seen this guy (Rob) back in TN!  I had an orange and a little Debbie cupcake.
When I finally got to the hostel I met Swiss Miss, the only other person staying the nights.  She has come from GA and was taking a zero tomorrow.  After a shower the 2 of us walked down the street to get pizza and local beer (Big Elm IPA for me!).

I modified my rain attire so I was wearing the tyvek rain kilt with just underwear underneath and I JSU had my bra on under my raincoat.  That way my clothes could be in my pack and stay dry. This worked!  I was fairly comfortable all day and only my skin got wet! It was a little difficult to deal with my snacks and phone without easy access pockets but my rain coat pockets did on.  It would s just hard to get to them with my hip belt buckled.
I stopped at both the TOM Leonard and South Wilcox shelters as reprieve from the rain.  In both I ended up talking to Waldo, a section hiker.
After the Tom Leonard shelter is an ice gulch where the sun never shines so the snow and ice stay present into summer.  An interesting place that I just peered over the edge at rather than go down
At south Wilcox I made oatmeal for lunch in order to have ended enough fuel to power me the 6 miles I had left.
I met Ninja Mouse during the day. He is a retired Iowa farmer.  Very interesting guy.  I learned about some Iowa geology as Jim and I had been to Devils Baxkbone in northeast Iowa.  I guess that area had been missed by the glacier.  The rest of Iowa was bulldozed smooth by the glacier which is why it’s so flat!

Then it was through a cow pasture and right through the herd of cows (complete with a bull). The cows were following me around and super friendly.
Then over some extensive boardwalks and finally to the Main rd parking lot where I was meeting Paula.
We hiked up Mt Baldy and passed knee deep pond.  The woods were pretty but what made the walk outstanding was having terrific company.  The miles flew by as we chatted.  
We decided to take the 0.5 miles side trail to Upper Goose Pond cabin.  There was a dock there that was a perfect lunch spot. We met Corey there.  He Is a section hiker and has just caught a bluegill on a homemade fishing rig.  We also met Rabid Raccoon, a thru hiker from TX.
After dipping our feet in the water and soaking up some sun we got back on the trail.  We walked through some magnificent mountain laurel, over I90, and our to Rte 20 where Paula got a shuttle back to her car.
I continued on.  Finerty pond was lovely and just after that I saw my first bear...well actually 4 of them!  3 cubs and a mama.  I heard a scramble up a tree and there was the first cub!  I got a pic of it and then said ‘where’s your mama?’  Immediately it scrambled back down the tree and I saw 2 black blobs move away.  I figured that was the mamma.  I hiked another 50 feet and off to my left I saw all 3 cubs and mama walking away from me.  They were too far to get a good pic.
The last 4 miles to the shelter were hard because I was exhausted.  When I got there I met some section hikers ( Craig and Tfoot) and I met the guy who was sleeping when I left that shelter...whetherornot.  Then Corey showed up.  There was some youth group campers around as well.  A very full shelter/campsite.

At the power lines I also called Bascom lodge. It is at the summit of Mt Greylock and rents bunks to hikers.  I was hoping for one on Friday night.  Unfortunately Wilco is happening at Mass MoCA and all the space was booked.  Rats!  (They did t even have a waiting list... I tried!)
In Dalton, I went to Angelina’s and got a 12” cheese sub with lots of veggies to go. Then went next door to Java and Juice and got an Arnold Palmer ( iced tea and lemonade) and a banana.  I downed those as I updated my trail journal.  
Then it was about 1.5 miles of road walk. Right at the end a woman pulled up in her car and asked if I was a thru hiker.  She had trail magic!  I told her the parking lot was just ahead and I’d meet her there.  It was her birthday and was gifting others!  I had a Mountain Dew.  Corey arrived (the blue gill guy from Upper Goose Pond).
Corey and I hiked the remaining 3.8 miles to camp.  He is interested I. Wild food and medicinal plants and fungi.  We had a real good time chatting and the miles and time flew by.

Up to Styles peak.  It was very buggy at the peak.  I found a small spot for my tent and set up fast and jumped in to avoid the black flies and mosquitos.  A short while later a couple showed up and took the other stealth site.  Margo and Colin hiked 700 miles of the PCT and quit due to snow.  They came east and are now hiking the AT instead.

Most of the morning was an uphill climb up Killington.  I still managed to maintain my 2mph speed and got to Cooper Lodge by 11:30.  I ate lunch there.  Dropped my pack.  Then hiked the very steep 0.2 miles up to the summit.  It was super nice at the top.  Breezy, cool and sunny.  I found Peach, Gopher and Walking Home at the bar watching the women’s World Cup game.  I got an ice cream and a beer and hung out with them for a bit.
I was back at Cooper Lodge at 1:30. Then, hiking on I found lots of moose scar but,again, no moose.  I love the north woods.  The balsam for smell so good.  I went through a really pretty area of paper birches.
I arrived at the shelter at 3:45.  I was the o loo where until almost 7 when Walking home arrived.  It was really quiet.  I think most folks continued on to town.","Clarendon Shelter

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618423,"I left at 6:30am.  The trail was unbelievably beautiful this morning. There was a section of very mature sugar maples with a carpet of wood nettle under them.  Under that was blooming ramps (wild leek).  I know it’s unnatural but it was still pretty.  I wonder how it is that there is no understory of young trees to replace the old ones when they die off.
The AT turned away from the long trail and the number of hikers dropped off noticeably.  I walked through the camping section of Gifford Woods state park.  I was really glad we did not camp there.  The sites were buggy and hard packed sandy gravel.  
Just after that I walked along Kent Pond where 2 loons were singing.  My first loons in the trail!
I found the side trail toKillington village and took it.  It went to the Base Camp Outfitters where I purchased stove fuel and a mountain house dinner. I left my pack there and walked down the road to the deli.  There I got egg and cheese on an everything bagel and a coffee.  I also got a couple of bagels to pack out.  As I was enjoying my second breakfast at the picnic table outside, DaveNitup showed up!  His wife has been driving him around so he can slack pack.  His ankle still isn’t great.
They gave me a ride back to the outfitters.  There I ran into Cricket.  She and Salamander are just behind me because they hitched to the village rather than walk the spur trail in.
Just after getting back on the trail I passed thundering falls, the tallest waterfall I VT that is on the AT.  It was impressive.
Then came a long boardwalk with the tallest tall meadow rue I’ve ever seen.  
The next section was a steep climb up Quimby Mtn and a fairly steep climb back down. I met Peach and Gopher slack packing SOBO here.  Peach told me to not stop at the shelter but to continue to the stream for a break.  Which I did.  It was lovely.  It was even better at the next stream!  Vermont really does have terrific streams.
There was a great stealth site next to Stony Brook which I came close to setting up at but I really needed to hike 3-4 more miles to make tomorrow’s plan.  There are not shelters in convenient places right now so I’m having to guess where good stealth sites will be.
Soon after I met a section hiker, Butter Bear, who told me there was a water source coming up that was not in my guides.  Sure enough, I found it and a great stealth site.  Flat, open woods and bug free!  It’s also pretty stealthy.  A bunch of hikers have cruises past and never saw me... including Cricket and Salamander!","Churchill Scott shelter

It is a cabin with a sort of widows walk on the roof.  You climb a steep ladder to get there.  Once there, there are benches to sit on and a spectacular view to take in.  I could have spent all day there.  As it was, I had a snack there and then continued in my way.
I did run into a bunch of young NOBO hikers:  Drover, Sheepdog, McFly, Trella, and Cake.  They were just getting going at 9 am...a bit late!
They left before me but then passed me a bit later as they all stopped at the next shelter and I didn’t.  I saw them again about 11am at the view of Mt Ascutney site.  I was planning on a lunch break and they were breaking. So I hung out with them a bit until they moved on.  
It was a long day of ups and downs. I finally reached Pomfret rd and walked a couple 100 feet to The Back Porch.  This is the home of former thru hikers that make snacks available for sale to hikers .  They have a great back porch that they let you hang out on. I’d course I ran into the gang there.  I had a soda and a homemade ice cream sandwich that was huge and delicious.  Just what I needed to fuel my next climb!
Because I am stealth camping in a dry location, I filled up my 3.5l of water and started walking.  Water is heavy!  The 0.7 miles straight up was a challenge.  Thankfully I have a super campsite!

Just a few miles into the day I saw 3 cubs and a mama black bear. The first thing I heard was the cubs climbing a tree then the mother was huffing and hissing at the base of the tree.  I backed up on the trail to give them room to run away.  Instead, mama bear climbed the tree.  The cubs went all the way up into the canopy and mama went up to a large limb about 30’ up.  She later on the limb like a cat on the arm of an overstuffed chair and stared at me.  It was clear she was not coming down soon.  Of course the trail went practically right under her.  After a few minutes I decided to just walk under her and see what happened.  I did not look at her at all. She didn’t hiss at me.  All was well and I went on my way.
During the day I caught a sweet odor in the woods and I wondered where it was coming from.  Eventually I came out into a field blooming with milkweed.  That was the aroma and it was heavenly in the field.
Other interesting plants today including Bulblet Fern on a limestone outcrop and a grape fern (Botrychium virginianum).
In West Hartford I walked over the bridge to the blue barn, Linda and Randy’s.  They are trail angels where I got a soda, muffin, and an ice pop.

When we came out on the road that took us into town, there trail magic of watermelon and banana bread with chocolate chips.  Yum!
We hiked in a loose group to Norwich where we resupply eras the local small grocery.
Then we walked over the bridge into NH!  In Hanover we went to Lou’s restaurant for second breakfast. I had a huge omelet, home fries, and a lemon poppyseed muffin (and coffee of course). We all left stuffed.
We walked down the ‘trail’ (the main drag in town) to the food coop where Tortoise ended his hike.  I bought some snacks in the coop and a huge piece of black bean pie with a side packet of sour cream (to pack out for dinner).
I charged my battery while there and had ice cream. Then I walked the mile out to the shelter before afternoon thunderstorms hit.  
I got to the shelter about 2 pm and set up my tent.  There was no one around so I read in the shelter.  When the storm hit, I collected water off the roof because the water source for this shelter was a bit of a hike.

We ate lunch together at Goose Pond Rd. Just as we were finishing, it started to rain.  We waited out the shower under the trees and did not get wet.  
Of course the trail was super wet so my feet got soaked on the climb up to Holts Ledges. By the time I got there the sky had cleared and there was a great view.  I met Sundial up there.  There were several view points.  One had been fenced off because peregrine falcons nested up there.  I did not see them though.

She was no longer hiking the trail but supporting her husband (Giddyup) by slackpacking him.  They had found another couple that would hike with him on The trail (Rabbit and Greyhound).  I met them (and saw Giddyup) soon after as I continued on.

It was a steady climb up but not terribly steep.  Just before 11am we came to the spur trail to the south peak.  We dropped our packs.  I put on a jacket because I could tell it would be cold once I was exposed above treelike.  Sure enough, once inthe open the wind was howling and it was cold. We had a good view of the main peak.
Back at the packs, I pulled out my puffy, leggings, and extra socks (to use as mittens if need be).  Then it was off to the peak.
An hour later we were up there.  The wind was so strong that it was hard to walk a straight line! There was trail magic up there!  A class of 2012 guy was handing out snickers to the thru hikers.
We arrived the same time as Acorn and Mad Tree!  So this fellow took our picture at the summit.
There are the remains of foundations from a hotel that used to be up there.  Lots of partial rock walls provided us with a wind break.  Sitting there it was much warmer than standing so we could have some lunch.  Sparky had brought up a beer to celebrate.
I did get cold sitting still. In fact my fingers were starting to go numb.  So I packed up and got moving.  Spacemaker and I hiked together down the very steep descent.

We had a long steep climb up and down Old Blue Mtn.  It was also steep over the many bumps of Bemis Mtn.  There were plenty of views.

It was amazing how she did not move even when I got close to her.
We camped near a dirt road and a stream.  We were super parched when we got there.  After dinner we had a hell of a thunderstorm.  Part of my tent site had a dip that filled with water.  Thankfully the tent did not get wet inside... though it felt like a waterbed under the tent floor!","Andover, ME

I hitched a ride into Front Royal.  I thought I was going to ShopNSave but Paul told me it had closed.  He brought me to Martins grocery which was much better.  The folks there were super nice and gave me a room to leave my pack and then use to organize my resupply.
I was looking around for a restaurant or some such.  I stopped in a tobacco store to ask where was a good place to get breakfast.  I was given 2 options.  When I got back outside, the woman who was a customer told me the Front Royal Diner was the best food for the money and the portions were big.  So off I went.  She was right!  I had a great breakfast and charged my devices.
At breakfast a pair of women about my age sat at the table next to mine.  They had a million questions about my hike.  Of course they claimed that they could never do such a thing.
After eating, I wakes back to the highway and hitched back to the trailhead.  The woman who gave me a ride told me about the zoological center that the trail passes by.  I guess they keep exotic animals there for zoos.
Back on the trail, I waked about a mile and a half and there was trail magic!  A 4H group had left a cooler with oranges, orange juice and fruit cups.  I had juice and a fruit cup.  My pack was already super heavy so I did not carry an orange, as much as I wanted one!
A few miles later I entered Shenandoah Park and got my registration tag. The registration area was just a kiosk in the woods.
At Compton Peak I dropped my pack and took a side trail to an unusual geologic formation.  Lava has crystallized into hexagonal columns.  Looking up at the Rock was like looking at a giant honeycomb!  It was definitely worth the extra steps to see it.
I found the stealth camping spot that I was planning on. It’s nice and flat!  There is a stream just south of it so I have water.  And there are good trees to hang my food so bears can’t get it!  Perfect.","Jim and Molly Denton shelter

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622172,"I got to the first ‘view’ but I was in a cloud.  I called Jim to check In And as we were talking, the clouds lifted and I could see out into Virginia.
I got to Elkwallow Wayside at 12:30.  There are several of these store/deli shops in the park.  I got a soda and a banana and went to eat lunch at a picnic table. (I passed up the veggie burger because I had to get some food out of my pack!)
As I was eating, a storm rolled in.  I moved all my stuff to undercover in a breezeway like area.  I already had my phone charging there.  As it turned out, a ranger showed up to give a talk about black bears.  There were just about half a dozen of us at the talk.  The ranger did a great job.  I learned how to tell the age of cubs (by size and ear size) and how to tell males from females (by snout and ear shape).  She clarified for me that the cubs I saw in MA were born in 2018.  The ones I saw in VT were born this year.
I left the wayside at 2:30 and hiked the next 7.7 miles is 3 hours.
At the hut I met SOBOs Fruitloop and Foot Loose.  We had a great time chatting.  These guys would be fun to hike with but they are going 25-30 miles a day .... out of my league!
I had a mini disaster today.  I had been listening to podcasts in the afternoon to make the miles fly by easier (I haven’t done a lot of that on this trip so it was unusual).  I had my phone in my shirt pocket rather than my skirt pocket.  When I went to get water at the spring, I leaned over and my phone took a dive in.  So far it seems to be working.  I put it in a bag of oatmeal for tonight.  Fingers crossed it continues to work!","Compton Springs stealth site

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622173,"My shelter companions’ alarms went off at 5am.  Even though I was not hiking with them I decided to get up and get moving.  I left camp at 6:30 (about 30 min. behind them).  I took my time today.  
I stopped at Byrd’s Nest hut for water.  I was going to take a morning break there but there were 10 students from Washington Lee University there on a pre-orientation for incoming freshmen.  I chatted with them briefly and then left them to their breakfast and I walked down the way a bit to a sunny place to have a break.
It was a sunny but super windy and cool day.  The trail up Mary’s Rock and the Pinnacle were spectacular.  The trail hugs the side of the mountains so you have views out all along the way.  I stopped at the Pinnacles Picnic area for an extended break and sat in the sun.  I dried out my tent, shoes and socks.
I had a nice conversation with a retired food engineer.  He had designed machines for the meat industry.  He was vegetarian because of it!  His so. Is the state ornithologist for RI (my home state).  It was a delightful conversation as the ravens and vultures soared overhead.
I left the cliffs and only walked about 1.5 miles to Skyland Resort.  I had a huge lunch there and then headed to Rock Spring hut.  My intention was to stay there but there was another group of college students there so I got water and headed to a stealth site at Franklin Cliffs.
About a mile from the cliffs I passed a trail maintainer. The stealth site was nice but it was not regulation 20yds from the trail.  I was worried that I’d be asked to move. I fiddled around hanging my bear bag line and eating dinner.  I talked to a couple of day hikers. Finally I just set up the tent.  Then I went out on the rocks to watch the sunset.
Just before the sun set, the trail dude showed up.  Bob and I had a really nice conversation.  He was also a retired engineer.  He left after the sun set.  He never saw my tent ... just asked if I was ‘back country camping’. Phew!","Pass Mountain Hut

I seemed to move sow today.  I got to Lewis Mtn Campground (only 8 miles) by 11. I met 5k there.  He just graduated from high school and is doing a flip flop hike from somewhere in PA.  He was taking the long weekend off the trail with family.  Our conversation made me realize it was Labor Day weekend and is missed the whole summer at home.  It doesn’t seem like I’ve been on the trail that long!
I really needed to make miles in the afternoon so I downloaded a bunch of RadioLab podcasts and had a podcast festival all the way to the hut.  I got there by 5:30.  Overall I made up for my slow miles in the morning by doing well in the afternoon.
During the day I met a section hiker, Resolute, as I hiked up Baldface Mtn.  I saw him again at South River picnic area.  There was no water at the area as they had shut off all the spigots due to lack of water.  Resolute was ending his hike there so he gave me a couple of bottles of water.  Trail magic!  Not only did I use the water but I needed a new scoop for water at springs that are not piped.  So I could make one from one of these bottles.  I actually needed that scoop at the spring tonight!
I almost stopped at the top of High Top Mtn because there was a good stealth spot and there was water in the spring.  I decided to go to the hut instead because there was already a tent set up there and I could see that a bear hang was going to be challenging because the trees were short.","Franklin Cliffs stealth site

Overall it was a pretty day in the woods with nice views on either side of the ridge. There are lots and lots of people on the trail due to it being a holiday weekend.  
I resupplied at Loft Mtn store.  I meant to take a long lunch here but the sky started looking dark.  Originally I had seen a forecast of storms starting at 2:30.  I asked a woman there if she had an update as I had not service.  She told me they had pushed the storm prediction to 5:30.  I figured I could make the remaining 8.5 miles by The if I left at 1:30.  So off I went.In the afternoon I saw a young bear in a stream.  He was turning over rocks.  I assume he was looking for crayfish.  I had seen a crayfish when I had gotten water from the same stream just minutes before. The bear was not phased by me at all!
I pushed hard and got to camp at 4:30!  But my feet definitely were abused by that.  I put some biofreeze on them that I’ve been carrying since the beginning.  I’ll also take some ibuprofen just before bed.
I’ve had great fun chatting with people from all over ( Germany, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia). I guess I don’t have to worry about bears tonight!

I had particular fun talking to a pair of women (Nosy and Chef).  We talked about backpacking, herbs, yoga, homesteading.  I didn’t leave camp until 8!
Most of the morning was hiking in a cloud so everything felt damp and there were no views. It finally cleared up midday and started to dry out.
I got to camp at 3.  I should have been here sooner but the AT had a detour around some power line work that added an unofficial mile to my trip today.
There is another hiker here.  No Service Curtis thru hiked in 1989.  Now he’s doing some sections with his dog Micky.  Micky is not friendly at all.

There were nice views from the top of Little Calf Mtn.  I also passed by an impressive array of communication towers on Bears Den Mtn.
I arrived at Rockfish Gap about 11am. Cora (aka Stops A Lot) picked me up and brought me to the hostel.  I showered, did laundry and went shopping at a Walmart ‘Neighborhood Market’.  
I tried to get a restaurant meal at an Italian place (closed due to the holiday) and a Mexican place (closed for who knows what). So I ended up at Burger King and had an Impossible burger.  It was pretty good! I topped it off with a pint of Ben and Jerry’s cherry garcia.","Calf Mtn hut

Einstein has already hiked the AT and the PCT.  He is hiking the southern half of the AT again with the goal of completing it in 50 days.  Mushroom Man is super interested in edible mushrooms.  We compared notes about what we’ve found on the trail so far.
Taco Money and I caught the first shuttle this morning and were on the trail by 8am.  He’s an odd duck.  He is also a flip flopper but out of Rockfish Gap.  He took a couple of weeks off between halves.  He clearly did not want to hike together or even make plans for the end of the day.  We ended up leapfrogging each other during the day.
Early today I passed an old foundation and a very humble cemetery.  The markers in the cemetery were just flat rocks.  I doubt anything was ever written on them.  One had some faint lettering. Later in the day I met 2 older gentleman (Shug and Junkyard) hiking for the day.  They gave me a honey bun (my first on the trail even though they are super popular trail food)!  Shug’s grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles were all born in that house!  The folks in the cemetery were also relatives.  I had noted a recent marker and he confirmed that they buried some ashes there recently.  
As I was chatting, Taco Money arrived.  We continued on to the next shelter which had a sleeping hiker in it...even though it was 10am!.  
I climbed Humpback Mtn where I got a view back to Bears Den Mtn ( with the communication towers on top).  All the springs/streams were running so I kept hiking with the idea of quitting about 4:30.  Of course the next spring I came to (at 4pm) was barely running.  It took me 1/2 hour to collect 3 liters of water.

Much of the day was waking on trails that hugged the side of the mountain. Some of the day was challenging ups and downs and rocks.  I was definitely mountain climbing again.
Very few people on the trail today.  There was a hiker that passed my stealth site first thing this morning.  He had his head amp on because it was still dark.  I didn’t pass another person until I saw a couple on Three Ridges Mtn.  I saw SOBO Buzz at Harpers Creek Shelter.  Then 3 more hikers in the afternoon.  That was it.  Very quiet on the trail.
While I was at Harpers Creek Shelter, I decided I’d only go as far as the Tye River.  I’d save the almost 5 mile ascent of The Priest for tomorrow.  I was not up to that today.  In addition, it got hot and humid today which made hiking a chore.
I passed 2 yellow jacket nests right on the trail today.  Thankfully someone had marked them so I could avoid them!
I spent the afternoon in the river.  It was terrific to sit in a ‘whirlpool’ and just relax.  Then I enjoyed reading.  It was a relaxing afternoon.","Stealth site at mile 1345.6

I got on trail at 7:15, crossed the suspension bridge, and started the long slow climb up The Priest.  Thankfully there were lots of switchbacks.  Even so, my phone says I climbed 439 floors today!
I stopped at the summit and again a short while later at the shelter where I read and contributed to the ‘confessional’ (aka the shelter log).
I continued on to Spy Rock.  Had lunch there, met a couple of day hikers and then climbed the rock (without my pack).  There was a great 360 degree view.
I was already tired (and it had only been 8.5 miles), so I put my ear bud in and queued up some podcasts. I started to make some miles!  At Piney River North Fork I gathered 3.7 liters of water.  I managed 5 more miles to a stealth site on Tar Jacket Ridge.  I’m half glad I’m here.  It’s a terrific view but the clouds are lowering and the wind is picking up.  It promises to be a damp evening.
I did pass a couple of weird things today.  On my way up The Priest, close to the top, I saw a hunting dog with a radio collar on.  It was many miles before I saw what might be his owner’s truck.  It was a pick up with a kennel and a Bunch of antennas on top.  There was no one in the truck though.
The other weird thing was right past Piney River. There was a complete abandoned campsite.  It had a tent, sleeping pad and quilt, food (that had been scattered by critters), clothing, and a pot.  There was all kinds of stuff there that had weathered at least one rain storm.  It was creepy.  I was glad I wasn’t camping there!","Tye River stealth site

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622553,"As suspected, I was in a cloud all night.  It sort of rained though I think it was condensation on the tree leaves and the wind shook that water down onto the tent.  Because of the wind, I had to close the vestibule flaps.  I knew that would mean I’d have condensation inside.  It was either be damp from rain or condensation.  Oh well.  The dawn was beautiful so it was worth it!  
It was cold this morning.  The dampness and wind made for a chilly start... which made me hustle through morning chores!
The hike over Cole Mtn was jaw-droppingly gorgeous. I had views all around and the meadows allowed me to see the path of the trail.  It was similar to the feeling I had on Franconia ridge in NH.
I stopped for lunch at the Brown Mtn Creek Shelter.  About 1.5 miles spanning either side of this shelter there has been a share cropping community. You can see lots of stone walls.  There are chimneys and parts of foundations and even an old spring box.  The ground is super rocky and gets steep a short ways from the creek. It is hard to imagine how the folks here eked out a living.  The forest service bought the land from the last inhabitants I. The 1920s.
I saw no other hikers all day until I got to Punchbowl Shelter.  There I chatted with NOBO Jaws.  He’s a retired firefighter from FL.  I’m in my tent tonight.  I suspect it might get buggy because there is a stagnant pond by the shelter.

I shown my headlamp out of the tent but saw nothing.  My tent was a substantial distance from the shelter so I wasn’t surprised.  I figured it was either a bear, raccoon or Jaws himself.
This morning Jaws told me he saw the bear and after the bear got scared off, a raccoon visited. I was glad I was not in the shelter last night! The good news is that we both hung our food so neither animal got rewarded.
I saw several hikers today (big change from yesterday).  It is Friday so the weekenders are out!

The trail followed the river for about a mile. In that stretch, ripe pawpaws were falling out of the trees!  I picked up a big one, peeled it and ate it.  If my pack wasn’t so heavy with a full resupply, I would have gathered a few more!
I stopped at Marble spring for water.  The springs are pretty small right now.  I managed to scoop a liter out.  There was a cute salamander in the spring.  I hope it stays wet enough for the little guy.
I did not stop at Harrison spring because Genius (our shuttle driver) told us there would be water at Thunder Hill Shelter.  I got there at 3pm and found NO water!  There were instructions on where to go to get water but it was about 0.7 miles away.  Because it was south of the shelter, I decided I’d keep walking south and only go out of my way 0.4 miles (which is really 0.8 miles walking there and back).  At least I was successful in getting water!  I filled up 3.7 liters and kept walking south.
Of course the trail went up up up.  On the way I passed a rock structure called the guillotine.  There is a boulder caught between 2 giant rocks.  If it fell when you walked under, you’d get clobbered!
I found a stealth campsite on the top of Apple Orchard Mtn.  Thankfully it was in the shade.  There is a weather radar antenna up here that looks like a giant soccer ball.

I saw Ahab at Cornelius creek shelter about 9am.  He was just getting up!  He said Taco Money had stayed there last night as well,

I decided to hike on.  Got to Jennings Creek and seriously thought about staying.  There are lots of nice tenting sites there.  I actually was feeling better in the gut so I loaded up with water and pushed on another 3.3 miles (1/2 of it uphill) to this shelter.  I knew there would be no water here.
I got here about 4:45.  I started at 7:20.  It was a slow day!  A lot of the day was descending Apple Orchard Mtn.  Down is always slow for me because it is hard on my feet and ankles.
I scared a raccoon today.  It shimmied up a tree and stared me down!  I also passed a humongous pile of bear scat (perhaps a whole gallon!).  It looked like mostly apple peels and seeds.  Interesting because I haven’t seen any apple trees close to here.  (The mountain is named because the oak trees look like apple trees due to the way the wind and weather shape and space them).  Anyway, I wouldn’t want to run into the bear that did that!

The shelter had a cistern for water. There was a mechanism to pipe the runoff from the roof.  I wish I had thought to take a picture of it.  It was great to have water at the top of the mountain!
It was any easy walk into town.  I was there by 9.  Along the way I saw a variety of wildlife.  I ran into my fourth box turtle in VA!  He was right in the middle of the path.  I saw 2 flocks of turkeys, one in a meadow and the other in the woods.  And I saw a buck with velvet antlers.
I decided to stay at the Super8.  They have a good hiker discount and I can do laundry here.  They even let me check I. Even though it was before 10am and it was way before a normal check in time.
I dropped my pack in the room and immediately headed out for second breakfast.  I walked a short way down to a super plaza with all sorts of stores.  I strayed at Mill Mountain coffee shop.  They roast their own coffee.  The French toast and eggs were good.  The service was weak.  They didn’t seem like they wanted to help customers at all.  They brought out my breakfast and silverware but I had to hunt down my own napkin, salt and pepper.

I went next door to the outfitters for fuel and some hunter orange stuff. I’ve been a little worried about hiking with hunting season approaching.  So I bought a hunter orange buff and bandanna.  I also got some hiker meals and cliff bars while there.

Then it was off to the next store down, Kroger’s, for the rest of my resupply.

I left at 7:15 for the trail. The hardest part of the day was getting across US220!  The traffic was heavy and fast.  I had to cross 4 lanes.  Luckily there was a median so I could do it in 2 pieces.
It was an easy climb up to the ridge.  Most of the day was walking along the ridgeline.  This is the theme in Virginia.  The trails follow narrow ridge lines where the land slopes down to either side.  It’s quite beautiful but impossible to capture in a photo.
It was a super hot and humid day.  Temps were in the 90s.  That means I drank lots of water which means I had to carry lots of water because water is scarce. Carrying extra weight on a hot day is not exactly fun, especially when the terrain gets steep.
It was quite a climb up to Tinker Cliffs. Once up there the views were spectacular!  The rock formations were also amazing.
I got to the shelter about 3:30.  There was a section hiker, Todd, there.  He’s a special education teacher.  We chatted a bit and then I went to get water.  The source was a literal trickle.  It took about 30 minutes to fill up 3 liters.

Dragons Tooth was shrouded in cloud.  It was a super cool looking rock that benefitted from the fog around it.
I found a fifth box turtle on the trail today.  This one was a female.  When I picked her up, she totally closed her ‘box’ so I could really see the hinges plastron (lower shell).
I took a little side trip down the blue blazer trail to the Audie Murphy monument.  There were lots of offerings (flags and stones) to the memory of this most decorated American soldier of World War II.  He died In a plane crash near the site of the monument.
Water is still scarce. Luckily there was some at both Trout Creek and Craig Creek.  I carried 4.5 liters the last 1.5 miles to this shelter because there is no water here or for the whole morning hike tomorrow.
We did have a light rain yesterday afternoon and evening.  It uncurled the rhododendron leaves but that was about it.  A thunderstorm just started!  ...and there are puddles forming!  A good sign.
I passed 1500 miles today.  It is hard to believe that I have hiked that far.  Less than 700 to go!","4 Pines Hostel (VA624)
",Niday Shelter ,"Sep 14, Sat",16.80
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623232,"I was the only one at the shelter last night.  I’m sure it’s because there is no water here. 
I was on the trail just after 7:30.  First thing was a climb up to the Eastern Continental Divide Ridge. I walked that ridge for about 6 miles.  There were spectacular views!  The thunderstorms last night really cleared the air so there was no haze. There were low lying clouds in the valleys below the ridges.  I was looking down at all that.
Coming down from that ridge I encountered 2 women from CA.  They were hiking portions of the AT.  They were thru-hiker wannabes so they had lots of questions for me.  One of them gave me a ‘survival bracelet’.  It’s made with 8’ of paracord.  So if I need cord for anything, I got it!
At the bottom of the descent, I saw the Keffer oak.  It is the oldest oak on the AT.  It was very large but not as big as the Dover oak I saw in NY.
After that the trail went through some pastures and then up and over Kelly Knob.  At Rocky Gap I ran into Grizzly Gramps, one of the hikers that was at 4 Pines hostel when I was there.  We hiked the last 3 miles to the shelter together.  Chatting with someone always makes the miles fly by!
There is quite a crowd at the shelter tonight:  Stumpy (section hiker) and NOBOs Rambler, Graybeard and Chris.  They all were super helpful in filling me in on where the water sources were going south.
I stayed in the shelter so I wouldn’t have to pack up my tent in the morning.  That way I can get on the trail sooner.","Niday Shelter

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623233,"Again I managed to get on the trail be 7:30.  I had a 1700’ climb first thing!  Luckily VA believes in switchbacks so the climb was long but gradual.  On the way up I saw a fabulous buck.  He had to be an 8 pointer and he just stared at me for the longest time before taking off.
I stopped at Wind Rock for a super view. Just after that I had to negotiate 2 miles of boulder field. That slowed me down and was tough on the feet.
I went all the way to Pine Swamp Branch Shelter (12.7 miles) before stopping for lunch.  There was water there so I loaded up.  Of course it was uphill for 1200’ after that and then a few more miles before I found a good stealth site.
About a mile before my campsite I scared a very large (200-250#) bear.  I had heard there were a couple of bears on this ridge but I was not convinced I’d actually see one.  The sighting motivated me to do a super duper good job hanging my food tonight!
I found some sulfur shelf (chicken of the woods) mushrooms today.  They made a nice addition to my white bean and kale meal...yum!
I also found a lot of gentian on the trail today.  I was surprised because I usually think of gentian as being in a wet place.  This species was w home on the very dry ridge.","War Spur Shelter 
",Stealth campsite at mile 1539.7,"Sep 16, Mon",16.70
Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623234,"It was an easy walk in the ridge this morning.  I found what I thought were American Chestnuts (the actual nuts) up there. This surprised me because I was unaware that any chestnuts were reproducing in the wild. My friend Charissa questioned whether they were buckeyes and after a little research, they are buckeyes!  
I walked through an old orchard up on that ridge.  Most of the apple trees did not have apples but one was loaded.  The apples were sweet and crispy!  They actually reminded me of honey crisps (my favorites).  I ate 2!
I stopped at Rice Field Shelter about 11am.  There is a spectacular view from there!  The shelter is just off to the side of a meadow that covers the top of the hill along the ridgeline.  There is a sweeping g vista there. It would be a great shelter to stay at. Unfortunately I was pretty much out of food so I had to keep hiking.
It was a long descent down into Pearisburg. I made it to the road crossing by 2:50!  So I made great time today.  I called for the shuttle into Angels Rest Hiker Haven Hostel.  I did my laundry, took a shower, walked to the Food Lion for resupply.
What is amazing is that way back in  PA, I met a hiker called Sir Stops A Lot.  He gave me a bracelet that would get me free laundry at this hostel (which I took advantage of).  Well he is here at the hostel!  It is pretty amazing that I hiked all the way to ME and then started south in WV and run into him again.  It has to be something like 1300 miles since I saw him last.  People say this sort of thing happens all the time on the AT.  Now it has happened to me!","Stealth campsite at mile 1539.7

Breakfast was hash browns, eggs, and a spice cake. The coffee was out of this world.  She roasts her own coffee!
It was hard to leave not only because of the food but also the conversation was terrific.  There was a couple from Chicago: Lee and Lott.  They were a hoot to talk to.
I finally got on trail at 9:20! Good news was the trail was super easy today.  I was done by 4pm and I took a whole hour for lunch. In one section I did 3.6 miles/hr!
Lunches at Wapiti shelter where I met Bothways.  He’s a section hiker that hiked in and out for each section so he will complete 2 thru hikes when he’s done.  It takes all kinds!

We didn’t get breakfast until 8.

I got on trail about 9:30.  Not too bad considering.  Flapjack was apologetic. It was a nice day in the woods.  It was a long climb up to chestnut knob (which is 4300’).  I rested up there and enjoyed the gorgeous view.  It was a good place to call mom and Jim.

Then I said goodbye.  It was hard and sad. I really enjoyed her company and I’m selfishly upset that I’m on my own again.  I cried for the first 15 minutes on the trail.
I had about 45 rain-free minutes before it started. I immediately got hit in my rain coat so I stopped to remove my shirt and skirt; hiking in just underwear and rain gear.  That felt great for a couple of hours.  Then I arrived at the balds. The breeze was stiff.  I had climbed 2300’ and the temperature had plunged.  I had to practically run to keep warm.  My hands were freezing.  I tried gripping and relaxing them over and over to warm them up.
In that stretch I met a family who was also going to Overmountain shelter and I met Chris from Portland, OR. He had lots of questions about thru hiking.  He was trying out some sections of the AT to see if he wanted to attempt a thru hike.  After a few minutes I had to get moving again.
I got to the shelter which is a barn (and is now closed) and it stopped raining briefly!  I set up my tent, climbed in and out some warm dry clothes on.  I immediately get a lot better!  
I managed to get water before it started raining again.  When it did start, I was in my tent so I didn’t care.  I ate some snacks but I was pretty hungry and wanted something hot.  So I managed to cook by sitting in my tent and running the stove outside one door.  A hot meal made me feel even better!  It stopped raining again briefly so I could hang my food bag.

By the time I got to Grassy Ridge and Jane Bald the sky has cleared, I was above the clouds and the views were gorgeous!
After Carvers Gap I entered a pine/fir forest that smelled heavenly.  The temperature dropped significantly in that section. I popped out into a clearing where the Cloudand hotel used to be. ( that was one of those mountain houses that were popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s). I ate lunch there in the sun.
It was interesting going above 6000’ elevation and then coming back down.  There was a noticeable thermocline where it was cold above and warmer below.  I had to keep adjusting my clothing layers to stay comfortable.
I was I a forest for most of the afternoon except for a view at Little Rock Knob.
I made it to Clyde Smith Shelter about 4.  Did my camp chores and ate.  I was just getting into my tent when 2 SOBOs (ham bone and wood pile) showed up.
There were lots of day hikers and short section hikers (including 2 women out for 5 days (Rock turtle and monk)) out in the trail. The roan highlands and their balds are very popular.","Overmountain Shelter

This morning I walked through ‘thin’ clouds with the sun filtering through. The light and forest were so beautiful. I met 2 NOBOs (ash and spruce) who are trying to make it to Harpers Ferry this year.  They told me I’d be coming up on an apple tree soon.  Ash had some beauties in his pack.  
Sure enough o came upon an old orchard with lots of ripe apples on the ground (the ones on the tree were way way up there).  There were a few different kinds of apples.  I gathered a few red delicious type and another, more tart variety.  I ate 2 and packed out 3.  It was trail magic!


Then it was on to Cherry Gap Shelter for lunch and over Unaka Mtn in the afternoon.
This evening I talked to a local photographer who called Unaka Mtn the ‘emerald forest’. It sure was a good name for it. The mosses under the fir trees were neon green!
I got water about 2 miles before I made camp here on Beauty Spot. I have just about 360 degree views.  The sunset was super pretty.  Now that the sun is down it’s getting cold!  When I got here it was about 80!  I’m hoping for a beautiful sunrise this morning.
I did get trail magic 2 times today.  Dirt man and his dog Patches (who is 20 years old!) gave me a banana.  He had a whole bucket of buckeyes.  He was from Ohio (the buckeye state) and told me some tales of keeping buckeyes in your pocket for good luck.  Here at camp, a couple that had moved here from Ohio gave me a couple of bars.  One was a fig-carrot-cashew thing that was fabulous and the other was a Larabar.

Most of the day was typical forest.  Right at the end there was a rocky/ledge section which was hot and dry.  It overlooked the Nolichucky River.

I had a brief view from Big Bald before being docked in a cloud.  That didn’t help my mood.
On top of the mountain there were lots of mist nets set up for a bird banding operation.  That was interesting and I wished they were working when I went through but they weren’t.
Lots of people on the trail today... most day hikers from Sams Gap.  I did meet a woman my age (Showtime) who was out for 8 weeks.

I climbed up Big Butt Mtn where I hoped for a view but it wasn’t a frat one. Had a second snack there and then headed over a pretty bald. These high meadows are really picturesque.
Had lunch and got water at Jerry Cabin Shelter.  I had made 9.7 miles by noon.  That’s a pretty good pace.
After lunch I climbed up Big Firescald knob. This section was bouldering again!  I love that.  There was a stunning ridge with views out both directions.  This section was a bit challenging compared with recent trail sections.

I stopped for a snack at Spring Mtn Shelter and called Elmer’s Sunnyside hostel.  Unfortunately they were full so I called Laughing Heart Lodge.  Luckily they had room for me for 2 nights.  My plan is to get to town tonight and take a zero tomorrow.  It’s supposed to rain tonight and tomorrow so that would be good timing.
I had lunch at a campsite on Rich Mtn.  I met Thomas there.  He just got his associates in engineering and is enlisting in the Air Force.  He is planning to they hike before enlisting so he had lots of questions for me. 
Then he wanted to know if I was going to climb the fire tower. Because it was off the trail a short ways I wasn’t planning on it ... especially when I was doing extra miles today. But he was good company so I decided ‘what the heck’.  I’m glad I did.  Even though it was cold and breezy up on the tower, the views were outstanding!
After I got down, I had to make miles again.  The last couple of miles down into Hot Springs were over some very steep cliffs with beautiful views of the French Broad River.
After coming off the cliffs, the trail ran alongside the river before crossing it on the bridge into Hot Springs.
I immediately saw the ice cream place and stopped in for 2 big scoops in a waffle cone!  The trail goes right down the Main Street of town so I got to ‘tour’ the business district on my way to the hostel. When I passed the Dollar General, I spotted Spark and Green Machine!  We walked the rest of the way to he hostel together.

I purchased my Smokies permit using the computer at the outfitters and I bought a few things I needed there (fuel, mittens, a long sleeve shirt).  Then I walked to the Dollar General and Hillbilly Market for resupply.  Resupply was challenging as there was a very limited selection in both places.  I managed to put together both the food I needed to get to Standing Bear and through the Smokies.  Highlighter offered to drive a resupply box to Standing Bear for us!  That saved me from having to resupply I. Gatlinburg (which is 15 miles off trail in the Smokies).
Sauce, Spark and Jupiter made dinner tonight.  I joined them in exchange for doing dishes.  They are very creative.  We had spaghetti ‘glop’.  They used spaghetti, canned black beans and canned veggies from the free stuff at the hostel and added a jar of vodka sauce.  We topped it with Parmesan cheese.  Jupiter made corn fritter-like stuff using creamed corn and pancake mix from the free stuff at the hostel.  It was really good.  We covered it with marshmallows and microwaved it to melt them.

The cold kept me in bed until 7. It was hard to convince myself to get out from under the quilt!  I did finally get up, pack up and eat breakfast.  By the time I had done that, my hands were really cold.  The good nenes is that someone had left hand warmers at a shelter that I stopped at yesterday.

Max Patch was only 1.9 miles so I was there around 9:15.  I hung around taking pictures and chatting with some folks who were interested in the thru hiker experience.  It was so beautiful up there in the sun!  I was glad I did not camp up there.

There is a parking area very close by so many people come up to camp and experience the sunrise and sunset.
There were signs that said there was an elk cow and calf hanging around the area. I did not see them though.

It was a weird weather day.  It started out almost hot.  I was down to my summer set of clothes.  At higher elevation it was super windy (in fact high wind warnings were up!) so I had to don my leggings and my t-shirt.  By lunch I was getting chilly and had to put on a long sleeve shirt. When I got to Stecoah Gap, it was hot again!  
At the gap there was trail magic: clementines.  I sat at the picnic table and ate a couple as I called my mom and then Jim.
We also got trail magic back at Cable Gap Shelter. A section hiker ( Master Jedi) gave each of us snacks.  I got a coconut/chocolate bar.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624479,"There were crazy storms last night! Thunder, lightning, torrential rain and whipping winds.  Because I wa sin the gap, I was protected from the wind but I could hear it howling in the canopy. I had made sure that I didn’t pitch my tent under any dead stuff so I wasn’t worried about trees and branches falling on me but I could hear them falling in the woods.
he storm abated in the early morning hours. So I was up and on the trail at my normal time
First I climbed up to Cheoah Bald and was treated to a fantastic view.  It was worth weathering the storm to be up here in the early morning.
Then it was a long descent to the Nantahala Outdoor center (NOC). The Nantahala River was running strong and muddy due to the storms.  At the NOC I saw Jupiter.  She was yellow blazing because she injured her hip.  She was waiting for Sauce, Spark and Green Machine.  I purchased pizza and soda then laid my tent, quilt and sleeping bag liner out to dry.  Everything was damp from the storm last night.  While there, Spark’s dad Eric showed up.  He is going to hike with them for the last stretch.
I stayed there about 1.5 hours and then got back on the trail.  It was a fairly steep climb up to the ‘jump off’; a cliff with a sweeping view.  The whole area had a forest fire in 2016 so there is lots of evidence of that around.
There is only one other section hiker here at the shelter: Warren, a retired professor of environmental economics. He has done all sorts of fabulous hikes including Mt Everest up to the base camp.","Locust Cove Gap

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624485,"Such a gorgeous day! I left camp at 7:55 and was up on the Wesser Bald lookout tower by 8:15.  The weather had called for ‘dense fog warnings.’  That clearly was for the valleys below because I was looking down on a sea of clouds, the mountains like islands and the rising sun illuminating the mountain tops.  It was amazing.
The colors in the woods is really pretty now, mostly yellows and golds. I enjoyed those colors and a nice view when I lunches at Copper Ridge Bad.  I called Jim from there to discuss the end-of-trek plans. I only have 7 more hiking days left!  Except for tomorrow, they will all be long ones.
I met several section hikers going NOBO today.  Also saw lots of tourists when I got to the Wayah Bald stone tower (about 2:30). You can drive up to this site.  The views were super there but not as spectacular as on Wesser.
The rest of the day was unremarkable. I listened to some music and started a new audiobook, ‘The Giver’.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624486,"Section hiker Mike rolled in about 8pm last night.  Luckily he set up his hammock and didn’t bother me too much.  I slept great.
I got on trail at 8 am.  I was not in too much of a hurry because I knew it was going to be a short day.
The recent storms have put a lot of fallen limbs and trees across the trail. I had to navigate those over the last couple of days. The storms also knocked off lots of leaves so I was getting peek-a-boo views through the trees, especially along the ridge to Panther Gap.
I had arranged for a shuttle into Franklin, NC by the hostel folks.  They were due at Rock Gap at noon.  I got there at 11am so I had an early lunch and chatted with a couple of HVAC guys who were taking a break in the parking area.
Once at the hostel I took a well needed shower and had my laundry done. Then I went down to the Motor Co. Grill for a wonderful black  bean burger done ‘teriyaki’ style (with pineapple and teriyaki sauce).  The sweet potato fries were super.  They were actual spears of sweet potato with the skins, lightly coated with some yummy stuff and fried, served with real maple syrup!  Yum!
I stopped at the outfitters where I bought a merino beanie (they give thru hikers a discount!)!  They will exchange my worn out pair of darned tough socks so I’ll stop back tomorrow.  They also have a taproom there so I treated myself to a Wayah lager and signed the 2019 thru hikers banner.","Silar Bald shelter

On the way back I purchased some homemade cheddar potato soup and a quava cheese pastry to have for lunch.
I spent most of the day reading Chances Are by Richard Russo, our next book club read. I’ll actually be home for book club this month!
I had a blueberry scone with coffee for second breakfast.  Even though  not hiking I’m packing on the calories for the last stretch.
In the evening I got a ride to Asian King for all-you-can-eat buffet.  I mananged 3 platefuls!
Then I ran over to Walmart (it was raining pretty hard at this point) for resupply. While I was there the sky opened up and bucket of water came down.  The parking lot was flooded! Luckily I was just watching this from inside.
My ride back to the hoste was delayed because they had a major roof leak they had to tend to.  When I finally got back, the basement had started to flood.  The bunkroom is down there so Zen (the hostel owner) had me move to an upstairs bunk.  It’s all part of the adventure!","Rock Gap, Gooder Grove Hostel

There was a few Irish things in there but they are sorted by region of Ireland and I don’t know where the name comes from.Then it was off to the outfitters to exchange my Darned Tough socks.  This is the second pair that I wore out on the trek.  Thankful they have a lifetime warrantee and can be exchanged for new ones!I waked back to the hostel and made lunch that I purchased yesterday (minestrone soup, cheese scone and a mango). I finished the Russo book in the afternoon and downloaded my next read from the library.  Some more hikers are showing up.  Birdman got here late this afternoon.  Last time I saw him was in the Smokies.  Zen just left to pick up a couple more hikers.I’m really looking to get back on the trail tomorrow morning!","Gooder Grove Hostel

I cruised along at a great pace and has done 10.5 miles by noon.  Before that I climbed the Albert Mtn fire tower.  The very top was locked but from the top most accessible landing the views were spectacular. The climb down from Albert Mtn was fairly steep and rocky, so a little slow going. The leaves that had come off the trees as a result of the storms were piled on the trail hiding rocks and roots. They also were a bit slick so the footing was treacherous. I took my tome and got down unscathed.
At 12:15 I was at a beautiful overlook for lunch.  I made this a fairly quick stop because I still had a long day ahead to make my 20 miles.
In the afternoon I passed several section hikers.  I had to ford a stream!   Most streams were no problem to rock hop across but one had no possibility of that.  So I took off my shoes and waded across.  Boy was that water cold!  Consider that there was ice in places along the trail that had not melted by late afternoon.
The air was great for hiking today; cool enough so I was not sweating. Unfortunately that means it’s likely to be frosty tonight!","Gooder Grove Hostel

Last night a hiker showed up at camp after I was in my tent and then they left before I was out of my tent this morning!  So I have no idea who it was. I left camp at 8:10 and noticed another camper that had come in later last night.
It stayed cold all day. I never took off my mittens! It was not cold enough to hike on a coat though. I was in a merino t shirt, midweight base layer and my hiking shirt for most of the day.
In the afternoon I entered Georgia, my 14th state! The hardest part of the day was the climb out of Dicks Creek Gap; it seemed to go on forever (though it was only about 3 miles).  It was steep in some sections. I honestly think I was just tired from my long day yesterday.  That said, a couple of section hikers  said I ‘flew’ past them when I saw them at camp later on.
There are several folks at the shelter tonight including a brother/sister pair (Henry and Alice).  I’m staying in my tent because I think it is warmer.","Standing Indian Shelter

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624719,"I woke up this morning and was immediately disoriented.  Why was it so light out?  Why did my alarm not go off?  I had forgotten that he clocks changed this morning!  I sort of panicked a little because I had scheduled a 22 mile day and I was concerned I would have to hike in the dark.  I really did not want to do that.  It was also really cold this morning.  I put my leggings on over my base layer and had on all my shirts and jackets!  Thank goodness for ‘hot hands’!  I put them in my mittens so my hands were toasty warm.
I worked quickly through morning chores: packing the tent, filtering water and eating breakfast.  I managed to be out of camp at 7:30am!
Because I was in a gap, I had to climb out of it first thing.  There were lots of people on the trail today.  One young man told me I was approaching the most beautiful part of Georgia: Tray Mtn and Blood Mtn.
I had lots of climbs: Kelly Knob, Tray Mtn, Rocky Mtn and Blue Mtn.  Tray Mtn was gorgeous with great views. There were also great views on Rocky Mtn.
The last 5 miles of trail today was on an old forest road bed so it was easy hiking... just long. I got to camp about 5 pm and found Greyhound and Rabbit.  I had met them in VT along with Giddyup and Fearless.  They had just left them a few days ago.  I was sorry to have missed them as I enjoyed their company.
There are 2 section hikers at the shelter as well. Because it seems like it is going to be warmer tonight I’ve decided to stay in the shelter","Deep Gap Shelter

Lady Dundee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624721,"I had fun in the shelter this morning.  Greyhound and Rabbit are super interesting.  She has an MS in biology and spent 15 years working in the Alaskan tundra in a regulatory capacity (though her degree is in molecular bio). We had fun taking about the tundra and our experiences there. He owned a restaurant.  They are both upbeat folks.
I left there at 8:15.  I took my time because my plan was to only walk 13.9 miles.  There were quite a few short steep climbs and many views along the way.  It was cloudy and cold though; never warming up.  I kept trying to take off my mittens but having to put them back on.
I was at Neel Gap about 2pm.  That’s where the famous tree full of boots is.  Many people that start NOBO quit here and throw their shoes/boots into the tree here.  It’s also where the trail goes right through a building that houses and outfitter.  I was all set to treat myself to a Mountain House Mac-n-cheese to have for dinner but they didn’t have any (in fact they had no vegetarian meals!) so I didn’t buy a thing... and just kept hiking!  I really feel I could have used a few more calories but nothing in the store was attracting me.
Blood Mtn was steep!  There were multiple Smooth rock outcrops with outstanding views.  The stone shelter at the top was interesting but a bit creepy.  It seemed dark and dank; certainly not a place I wanted to stay!  There was also no water nearby.  I had thought I’d collect water on the way up the mountain but the intermittent spring was dry. So I had no choice but to continue hiking until I found water and a camping spot.
It wasn’t all that far when I came to a good flow of water across the trail.  I collected 3 liters and decided to camp at the next decent site.  About 1 mile down there is a side trail to another shelter.  The area at the intersection was flat and there was already a section hiker (Brett) set up there.  
I set up camp as we chatted. It was really cold so we both retired early.  As soon as I got in my tent, a couple  of section hikers (Colt and Ron) who I had met earlier arrived.  They decided to camp here as well.  We have a nice little enclave.","Low Gap Shelter
