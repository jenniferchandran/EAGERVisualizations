Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621692,"After 40 years of dreaming and 5 months of planning, my Appalachian Trail adventure is about to begin. New tent, sleeping bag and backpack. Decisions on how to filter water, how to keep the bears away from my food, what to carry, I am just two hours of away from Amicola Falls State Park and the 8.5 mile trail that will take me to the real start. I always envisioned hiking the AT as a thru-hiker but I can’t do that until I retire and I am not quite ready for that. But I have managed to eke out 8 weeks from work so I am going to see how far I can make it this fall and then will pick up next year and carry on.",,View Entry,"Aug 25, Sun",0

After hiking the 675 steps to the falls en route to the AT Approach Trail, I discovered a parking lot where I could have been dropped off. Oh well, knowing me, even if I had known that, I probably would still have walked the stairs. Long, hard day to Summit Mountain but storms in the area so temperature in the 60s instead of 80s as expected.  Then rainy and windy my first night but my gear worked and kept me warm and dry.",,View Entry,"Aug 25, Sun",0
Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621975,"Day 1: Easy morning.  Stopped raining and cool temperatures again. No one else on the trail although I did run into a few people at Long Creek waterfall. Talked to a couple of the volunteer AT maintenance crew and they gave me some pointers and advice for the next couple of days. Made it to Hawks Mountain Shelter a little after 2:00. Kind of early to call it a day but I was tired and hungry and had made my 8 mile goal so decided to stop. Set up camp, had an early dinner and relaxing and reading my book. Looks like I am the only one in the campground. Now it is raining again. I still need to put my food in the bear box so hopefully the rain will not last. 


Day 2: Poured down rain all night and had to pack up in the rain this morning. Everything is wet and covered in mud. Discovered I had misplaced my map after I started hiking so sure hope I am going the right way. Then I ran into Jim who I had met the first night. Turns out I had not camped where I thought I was last night. I was at the campground and not the shelter. Met a guy heading southbound on his 1000 mile hike. He was almost done. He says no more rain for the next few days. Hiked with Jim this afternoon until we reached the Gooch Mountain Shelter. Met Double G and we talked and fixed dinner. Then Jim from Mississippi showed up. They are all sleeping in the shelter but I set up my tent. Everything is still wet and dirty but starting to dry out. I had  phone service very briefly at one point today so I called Gil. Now I am charging my devices to hold me to Neel Gap.


Day 3: The four of us hiked together today. Sunny and warmer. Hard day and we stopped at Lance Creek Restoration campsite after 8 miles. There is a stream here so I was able to clean up my muddy ground cloth and finally get everything dried out. I made cheese grits with chorizo for dinner but knocked over my stove and spilled the whole thing. These little stoves are not very stable (not because I am clumsy). I salvaged the chorizo off the ground and started over with another batch of grits. Then I caught my bandana on fire. But I finally got to eat. Louisiana Jim is getting off the trail in 2 days so he is doling out his extra food since he overpacked. Snicker and honey buns tomorrow. I am totally embracing my inner junk food persona starting tomorrow.


It has been fun hiking with a tramily (trail family). Louisiana Jim is 57, GG is 65 and Mississippi Jim is 72. We get along great, everyone is an experienced hiker and we are pretty comparable on our pace at this point. No one treats me different since I am a woman. 


Day 4: Another hard day up to Blood Mountain and then down to Neels Gap. Staying in the bunkhouse tonight at Mountain Crossing. $20 for a bunk and a shower and frozen Red Baron’s pizza. High living. 


Even though I am in shape and trained for this, it is still really hard, especially the climbs. I know it will get easier but I mailed a few things home to lighten my pack by a few pounds.","

Hogpen Gap to Blue Mountain Shelter (Mile 50): 12 miles today - 10 easy and the last 2 were big rocks and roots and no fun. But I got to eat a Snickers. First one in years but sometimes you need a little motivation to keep going.


Caught up to GG. Lots of people camping here tonight since locals are out for the holiday weekend. They are howling and blasting music. May be a long night.


When we were at Neels Gap, Bill from Mountain Crossings adjusted my pack for me. The pain in my left hip and lower back are almost gone. Still need to figure out how to fix the pressure on my left shoulder.


Lots of climbing tomorrow so probably only 8 miles. Trying to get to Dicks Creek Gap by Monday afternoon to get a ride to Hiawassee for a zero day.

Mile 50.1 to 58.2.  Tray Mountain Shelter 
Just as predicted, a hard day with lots of climbing. Good water source so I was able to rinse my hair and a couple of things. Eventually GG showed up and then the nice guy with a dog who we camped with last night. His girlfriend has joined him. He wanted to know if we planned on howling and playing loud music tonight. 


Another long day tomorrow with only one major climb but Grace the shuttle driver is picking me up take me to Hiawassee for a zero day - no miles. I can shower, wash clothes, eat good and resupply my food for the next section.


Mile 69.2 Dicks Creek Gap
11 miles with only one major climb but the heat has kicked in. I am beat. Met another woman from Texas and she said “oh, are you Elaine?” Amazing how word gets around on the trail.

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622321,"Pack weight: My pack without water weighed 28# at the start. Doable but not ideal for a 66 year old, 120# woman. When I was at Neels Gap, I mailed my brain back - no, not THAT brain. The zippered pouch/top of the pack is called the brain by some. It is a good place to store items you might need while hiking. I rearranged things and put my snacks and miscellaneous items in a small duffle bag instead and I like it better and saved some weight. I sent back my extra water bladder and a few other items and saved a couple of pounds. I like having camp shoes but my Chacos are too heavy. Need to find a substitute. To really cut down on weight will mean an ultralight tent and pack. But that means more $. Another heavy item is my electronics - iPhone, mini iPad, portable battery source to recharge between towns but I use my iPad for work (bummer) and to carry LOTS of books. Also let’s me check in with my husband when I can get cell phone coverage so non-negotiable. Just a word of warning to other hikers to really think hard on whether you need it.


Navigation: 1. The best option is to hike with someone else who knows where they are going, where to get water, where to camp, etc. That worked for a few days but then my hiking buddies left me so I am on my own. 2. AWOL’s book is best for planning your day or route, identifying water sources, etc. but sometimes you still don’t know where you are. 3. Guthook‘s app uses GPS so you know where you are at any given time. This helps when you find a water source, you know which one it is. 4. Information from other hikers. Southbounders are a good source for status of water or shelters. But take all advice with a grain of salt. A fellow hikers told us we would be crossing the Hiawassee “River”.  I walked right on past that small trickle not realizing it was the river.


Solo hiking: Some people, especially women seem very reluctant to solo hike. I usually hike or bicycle alone (unless I am with my superstar hiking partner Anne, my sister-in-law) so I am used to it. I am perfectly content to hike all day alone with the occasional conversation with hikers you meet along the way and then fine with camping alone so I can read my book after setting up camp and fixing dinner. At the same time, right off the bat, I hooked up with a some other hikers who I hiked and camped with for several days. It was great and I hope to find more opportunities to meet and hang with fellow hikers, as long as I still can get my alone time.","

Finished Georgia. One down and 12 more states to go. The trail will now wind back and forth between North Carolina and Tennessee. Reached Bly Gap (9 miles) at 3:00 and still felt good so continued on to Muskrat Creek Shelter for 12 miles today. Legs are tired but otherwise OK. Nights have been cool enough to sleep in sleeping bag but warm tonight. Caught up to GG. There a few others camped here tonight.


Got stung on the hand. I think it was a ground hornet. Lots of nests around this time of year. I took Benadryl immediately so sore and itching but not swollen. The breeze picked up so not too warm after all.


Muskrat Creek Shelter to Carter Gap Shelter (Mile 93.5)


My hand was swollen this morning but nothing to stop me from moving on. Climbed to Standing Indian Mountain on long switchbacks so not too hard. A lot of the water sources marked on the map are dry. The understory trees are all dead. I think they are rhododendrons. Someone said there was a fire. So now, tall flowering plants have taken over and are growing out over the trail so much you can’t even see the trail at times. I either got stung by bees or had a reaction to the plants because my arm is covered in red welts. Uphill the last couple of miles for a total of 12.5 miles. Should sleep good tonight. 


Carter Gap Shelter to Long Branch Shelter (Mile 102.2)


Very windy last night due to a cool front coming in. Kind of cool this morning but warmed up as soon as I started hiking. My mishap of the day occurred when I had to cross a rock slab that was wet and I slipped. I ended up with a wet butt and a banged up arm but otherwise OK. Easy morning until Albert Mountain. There was a section that required a combination of walking and climbing until you reach an old fire tower. No longer in use but you could climb up. Great views. Then more easy hiking. The rest of the group went on to the next Shelter but I decided to call it a day at almost 9 miles. 11 mile average over the last 3 days.


One couple I camped with the last couple of nights was carrying 30 days of food with them. But no sleeping bags or cold weather gear. They are getting off the trail because  they are worried rain from the hurricane is heading our way. Met another older couple getting water and the husband is carrying a 55 pound pack and the wife a 35 pound pack. They are filtering water and using chemical treatment. They are also very concerned about possible rain. Not sure why since they seem to be prepared for anything. Then in total contrast, young man camped at same shelter last night is subsisting on peanut butter, beef jerky and mixed nuts. Take all kinds.


Long Branch Shelter to Winding Stairs Gap (Mile 109.4)


Great morning. Easy trail to Rock Gap Shelter where rest of group moved on to yesterday. I intended to stop there to rest and eat a snack but steep trail down to Shelter so I passed. Some rough, hilly terrain after that. I called for a shuttle at the top. Good thing because no cell service when I got to the road. Beverly picked me up to take me to Franklin. We stopped and had lunch at Shoney’s then she took me to my hotel. Too far to walk to grocery store so she waited for me to shower then we went to laundromat and then grocery store. I was almost out of food. She was wonderful because I would have had a really long walk in the heat to get to groceries. Heading back to the trail in the morning.","

Since Beverly plays organ at the church on Sunday morning, I got a ride with Jim Granato, a very nice man. He gave me a couple of apples, much appreciated. Restocked with food, I got on the trail about 11:15. Shortly after heading out, I met a man and his dog on the trail. He immediately said he recognized me. He has been reading my trail journal. Amazing.  He thru hiked a few years back and now lives in the area. Almost no one on the trail today but a few day hikers. Hiked by Silar Bald around 2:00 but too hot to check it out much. Even with a late start, I did 11 miles. Getting stronger. I saw a nice camping area earlier but it was a little too close to a road. For safety reasons, several people recommended camping at least a mile from a road and that sounds like a good idea.  So I moved on to the next shelter. I am camping solo tonight, starting a new book. Perfect way to end the day.




Wayah Bald Shelter to Wesser Bald Shelter (Mile 131)


Easy morning, saw a couple of long distance hikers including Yellow Shoes, a thru hiker. He flip-flopped (started mid way, hiked to Mount Katahdin then back to the middle to do the first half south bound). He had come from Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) where he zeroed and thought they were open until 8:00. Then hot climb out of Tellicho Gap to Wesser Bald and an observation tower. I was thinking of plowing on through to NOC to get bunk, shower and eat at restaurant. At Wesser Bald, I was finally able to get a cell signal and called NOC but they close at 7:00. Not sure I could make it and waste of time to push through 17 miles and everything closed. Then I look up and here comes Mississippi Jim walking down from the observation tower. He had been hiking the Benton MacKay Trail but it was so overgrown that he abandoned it after 50 miles and headed back to the AT. So we both stopped at Wesser Bald Shelter to camp. Very warm night.


Wesser Bald Shelter to NOC to Sassafras Gap Shelter (Mile 143.8)


Six miles mostly downhill to NOC but several blow downs including one where to get around it, you have to get on a slope sliding on your butt and hanging on to to trees to keep from sliding down the hill. I was really tired of downhill (knees and toes) by time we made it to NOC. Ran into two couples from few days before and heard GG’s wife came and picked him up so he is off the trail. The others were leaving from NOC too. Ate lunch at restaurant. Cheeseburger with fries and 5 glasses of iced tea. I was in heaven. Then 7 miles almost all uphill to Sassafras Gap Shelter. Did not arrive until 6:30. Too tired to cook so just snacked. It was so warm that I was soaked from sweating so much. Hung everything up to dry and sleeping in the shelter instead of setting up tent. ","

Long day. Drenched again within 30 minutes of heading out. Cheoh Bald was was grassy and a nice place to rest but only on trail for 30 minutes so figured I better keep going. Not real easy or real hard but a long day. Did not see one other person on the trail. Trail crossed road mid day and I stopped at picnic table to eat lunch. Talked to two guys, one was a shuttle driver and one was associated with tourism is some way. They gave me a few pointers about Fontana Dam. Long climb in the heat. I ran into so many cobwebs, I figured I had spiders nesting in my hair, gnats buzzing in my ears, feeling filthy and disgusting, not a great day. I did stop at a shelter in the afternoon to replenish my water supply and just poured water over my head to cool off. Did a long day to set myself up for the Smokies after leaving Fontana Dam. “Skinny kid”, a flip flop thru hiker staying at shelter tonight. Got some good advice about water, or lack there of, in Smokies.


Cable Gap Shelter to Fontana Dam to Birch Spring Gap campsite (Mile 172.3)


Yesterday was a good example of why you don’t quit on a bad day. I don’t think I had recovered from the hard day before and I did not sleep well either. I was not enjoying myself. Last night was a little cooler and I slept great. Today I had a whole new attitude. Saw my first rattlesnake on the trail. He showed no willingness to concede his territory but fortunately it was level ground so I just went around him. Made it to the Fontana Hilton about noon, the shelter so named for its amenities. Very nice shelter with a charging station, bathrooms and a shower. No one there but me. I went in to the shower and pulled everything off and threw it in shower with me. Just finished shower when water cut off. Must be on a timer. So I went to sink and washed out my clothes. I felt like a homeless person washing clothes at the bus station. I put on my dress and hung everything up in the sun to dry. I sat in the shade and called Gil. A little while later, two guys came by and offered me a beer. I told them iced tea was what I had in mind. They were Crazy Korean and Woodpile. They had thru hiked a couple of years ago . Crazy Korean was working at NOC and Woodpile just finished hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). He was going to meet up with his friend on the AT and hike with him to Georgia. Young, footloose and worry free. So I stuffed my wet clothes in my pack and they drove me over to the Visitor Center to pick up my package of food I had mailed. Apparently it is unusual to mail stuff to the Visitor Center but they took good care of my package and had been on the lookout for me. The guys then drove me over to the restaurant which was a couple of miles away. Iced tea at last. People were looking at me a little strange in my dress and hiking shoes. Then I had to cram all the new food into my pack and changed to my still damp clothes. Then I got a ride from the shuttle driver back to the Visitor Center. I was glad to hear there was water at my intended campsite so I did not have to carry an extra two liters of water. Then walked across the Dam in the blazing heat and along the road to the trail into Smokey Mountain National Park. No cars on the road and no boats on the lake although I did see one man fishing from the bank. I had purchased my hiker permit before I left home. You fill in the date you enter the park and put it in the box. You have 7 days to get through the park. Another long uphill trail in the heat. Ran into Crazy Korean and Woodpile again  coming back from their hike to the fire tower. They insisted on topping off my water. Talked to “Legs”, another Southbound thru hiker. He is on track to finish in about 100 days. Amazing. By time I got to the turn off to the fire tower, it was 5:30. I really wanted to check it out but shuttle driver said bears get more active at night so I decided to keep moving to be sure I made it to camp in time to get set up and settled in by dark.


After I got settled in, I was in my tent reading a book when I felt a sting on my leg. Turned on my headlamp and found one of those ugly reddish brown millipedes I have been seeing on the trail. I had forgot to zip my tent up all the way.


Birch Spring Gap to Spence Field Shelter (Mile 183.7)


Seeing two or three southbound thru hikers every day. Big topic of conversation is where to find water. Got in my mind I could make it to Gatlinburg tomorrow so planned to do 17 miles. When I made it to Spence Field Shelter, I nixed that idea. Blue Brew from Michigan who I met at last night’s campsite and I were only ones at shelter. You have to stay at shelters in Smokies due to bears. Section hikers with reservations get first dibs. I have been very concerned about ending up at a shelter with a crowd thinking I will never get any sleep. But OK tonight.


Spence Field Shelter to Double Spring Gap Shelter (Mile 197.2)


Everyone said Smokies was ridge walking with views. Had a couple of views first thing this morning but that is it. Not real hard but not easy either. Tough trails and my feet hurt. Most of the time you are looking down to make sure you don’t trip over rocks or roots and the tree canopies are so high that you don’t always notice changes in the trees around you. I knew we had left the oaks behind because I was no longer seeing acorns on the ground. But looked up and realized there were completely different trees I did not recognize except for a few birches. I wish I knew more about the eastern trees.

OK, be careful what you wish for. I was so excited to have the shelter to myself. Little did I know what lurks in the night. Shelters have metal roofs and it is very noisy when an acorn drops on the roof. All night long, there were things dropping and then boom!, something large dropping. One time I counted 25 bangs in a row then a boom!  Just about to doze off and boom! The next morning, I found these brownish-orange pods hollowed out and half eaten littering the ground. So I assume the critter was biting off pieces and dropping them (25 times) then once finished eating the insides, dropping the fruit/seed pod. Needless to say, I did not get much sleep. I would love to know more about the tree species here but that is a lesson for another day.


But this morning was wonderful. Cool temps and on the trail by 8:00. Everything covered in moss. Pretty dark in the woods even at 8:00 am, kind of eerie like something out of Lord of the Rings. The trail up to Clingman’s Dome was not too hard since already at a pretty high elevation. Clingman’s Dome at 6658 feet is highest point on the trail. There is a spiral walkway up to an observation tower but I have been up in the past so skipped it this time. So continued on to Newfound Gap to get a ride into Gatlinburg for a zero day. Trail intersected with a road/parking lot at one point and I was talking to a couple there. At some point we realized we went to elementary school together in Houston and were in Girl Scouts together. Small world. I think Girl Scouts is where I first discovered my love of the outdoors.","

I conquered my biggest fear on the trail - hitchhiking. Took less than 5 minutes to get a ride into Gatlinburg and 5 - 10 minutes to get a ride back this morning. 


Temps are still nice and trail was medium hard today. Views from Charlie’s Bunion were best of the trip so far. And finally made it to the ridge walking that everyone was talking about. At the higher elevations, more conifers so smells nice. More views today then the whole trip so far.


Made it to the shelter only to find it is a half mile down a side trail. Oh well, alternative is to walk 5 more miles to next Shelter. A couple was already here and 2 young guys just showed up. Good water and word is to stock up before heading out in the morning. Several others showed up before dark so Shelter is fairly full.


Peck Corner Shelter to Cosby Knob Shelter (Mile 231.1)


OK, it is official. My trail name is Showtime. Kind of in the works for weeks but thru-hiker Joy officially christened me with my new name. And also discovered I am a LASHer - long ass section hiker. I like that.
Four others including cousins Ash and Spruce from last night’s shelter are here tonight so nice to visit with everyone. One of the young guys is just recovering from a broken leg so really hurting. I gave him some ibuprofen which he much appreciated. 


Peppermint and Jerry-atric showed up just before dark. They are 2 older men who struggled the 7 miles up from Davenport Gap. Both thru hiked in 2011 although Peppermint broke his leg and was not able to finish until 2014. They are a hoot - taking their meds and trying to figure out how their new filter works. This is their last hurrah and may be their last backpack trip.


Cosby Knob Shelter to Standing Bear Farm (Mile 241.8)


Since no tent to break down, I fixed breakfast of cheese grits and still was on the trail by 8:00. Made it to turn off to Mt Cammerer fire tower after 2.8 miles. Since it was a relatively easy day, I walked the 0.6 miles to the tower. Definitely worth it for the views. Ash and Spruce showed up shortly after I did. They both had cell service and called their wives. Of coarse, I did not have cell service. 


Back on the trail and stopped off at Davenport Gap Shelter for a quick bathroom break. It is the last “caged” shelter in the park. Chain link fencing across the front of the shelter to keep bears out. I assume because it is so close to I-40 that they get a lot of clueless people staying there who cook or store food in the shelter. I saw a plastic bin in the shelter so went in. It was various food items (sealed up so no smell) left by trail angels who thru hiked in 2017. Since I had nothing for dinner, I grabbed a dehydrated meal, Thai Curry. Thanks, guys!


Ran into Ash and Spruce and we walked the final couple of miles out of the park and down into the Gap, under I-40, up the multiple stone steps, onto a hot, dry section of the trail serenaded by I-40 traffic. But finally made it to Standing Bear Farm, a hiker hostel. It is a funky, little oasis on the trail. We decided to have a beer (or margarita in a can in my case) before showers and settling in. I had the treehouse booked. I was downstairs but right next to the creek. As I walked around checking out the place, I ran into Blue Brew who was zeroing. Of course, Ash and Spruce thought I was just wandering around making new friends already. Nope, just reuniting with old ones. Gradually more hikers came in, including a solo woman thru hiker from Dallas. It is a fun, cool place to spend some time.


Next morning, I went to kitchen to fix coffee and Ash and Spruce (and Locust who I discovered was another cousin) were all eating eggs and bacon. They had bought supplies and cooked breakfast before it was even 7:00 in the morning. A little while later, I wished everyone happy trails as they continued on but I am headed home (for two weeks due to work commitments) but will be back to hike the next section in October.","

6:00 am flight with connection through Atlanta. We were running late so I did not think I would make my connection. But I ran through the airport and made it. And was happy to see my pack made it too. Maria shuttled me to Standing Bear Farm where I got off the trail two weeks ago. And I was back on the the trail a little before 1:30.


It was a 4.5 mile climb uphill but not too bad. Lots of people when I arrived at the shelter. Five women and a young man staying in the shelter and 3 men from Texas camped near the shelter. Most solo women I have seen on the trail since I started. Two of the women were smokers and left their poles and boots all over the place. Hard to find room at the table to cook dinner with all of their gear.  Getting dark earlier now so settled in my tent by 7:30.


Groundhog Creek Shelter to Walnut Mountain Creek Shelter (Mile 261.8)


Decided to push it to 13 miles. It was a good day. I slept great. The morning was mostly walking along a ridge. Not too warm. Stopped at a shelter to eat lunch. Afternoon was lots of rhododendrons and crossing small creeks. It rained mid afternoon but I did not bother to get out my raincoat or pack cover.  Good thing since it did not last long. Foggy and a little cooler after that. Then a medium climb brought me to the shelter. Got my tent set up in time before it started raining again. 


Found out the young man at the shelter last night got sick and apparently called for help. The fire department showed up at 11:30 but he had left the shelter. I slept through it all. 


OK, major rain and wind. I quickly fixed dinner once it slacked off. Everything is muddy and temps are dropping. What I have been wishing for. Will find out how well my sleeping bag works. 


Walnut Mountain Creek Shelter to Hot Springs, NC (Mile 274.9)


Had to pack up my wet, muddy tent this morning. But rain had stopped. Hit the high point of the trail by 10:00 am. Mostly downhill after that. Pretty hike but my feet were feeling bruised by the end. Another 13 mile day but a bed and dinner in a restaurant at the end. The trail literally runs through the middle of town. Staying at the Laughing Heart Hostel. Took a shower, washed clothes and went out to dinner. Not much selection for food resupply though. I hit Dollar General and will check out the natural food store tomorrow.
Solo and Tie, the current managers, are previous AT hikers and were very welcoming and accommodating. Breakfast at Smoky Mountain Diner. Joined Peg and Gamel who I camped with the last couple of nights. Gamel has thru hiked and section hiked. She started her thru hike 3 days after retiring. Peg is doing sections now and Gamel is providing support for a few days. After they left, Eagle Eye showed up with her friend Murphy, a triple crowner, who now lives in Hot Springs and works as a guide in Hot Springs. 
Worked using the library as a base. Just had to pay a dollar and it was much easier and more efficient than working on my iPad. I found out the Hillbilly Market has a pretty good selection so I shopped for food supplies and am now ready to go in the morning.","

Nice morning. Not too hot. Trail wound back and forth around the mountain from north to south side so the flora kept changing with pines and hemlocks in addition to the usual trees. Unfortunately, the hemlocks are dying because they are being attacked by an insect imported from China with no known enemy. The afternoon was pretty monotonous because it was uphill and there were only a couple of kinds of trees with the undergrowth all dried out and brown. 


Made it  to Spring Mountain Shelter around 3:00. There was a couple from Florida already there. After checking out the map, I decided I wanted to go a little further so I don’t have so far to go tomorrow. That means camping without a water source so loaded up on water. By that time, several more people had showed up so I took off. I found a good spot to camp about an hour later. Another couple showed up at this site too and decided to camp here too because they were newbies and did not think they could make it to the shelter. They had seen a bear shortly before getting to camp. Even though the bear was running away, the woman was very concerned it would come into camp. She showed me this big can of bear spray she brought with her. 


Deep Gap to Jerry Cabin Shelter (Mile 301.8)


Whew! Long day. Only 14.1 miles but it seemed longer. I guess because late afternoon was a very difficult ridge. Giant boulders to maneuver and climb over. I averaged 1 mile an hour through that section. But nice views. Met an older gentleman with his little black and white dog, Geronimo. He says he had hiked and backpacked all his life until he developed a medical condition a while back. Doctor said he had to stop hiking which he did. Then he rescued Geronimo in 2016. He decided to take him for a hike. He was a natural so he said forget the doctor and they have been backpacking ever since. They were on Day 51 for this trip, although they were getting off at Hot Springs. 


Made it to the shelter at 5:20. I went to get water and there are 2 trails. First option was dry so I was very concerned but slow trickle at the other. Since no one here but me, I decided to sleep in the shelter instead of pitching my tent. Big mistake because I did not sleep well.","

15.5 miles, that may be my record. Uphill sections and Big Butt, another big boulder section, interspersed with easy trails. Lunch at the Flint Mountain Shelter. Nice shelter. Then a series of difficult uphill climbs. I lost the trail at one point and went up a forest road. I did not go too far but could not figure out where the trail was. It was a large ravine and everything was covered in leaves. I heard voices and walked in that direction until I could see some hikers up on the hill and eventually found the trail. Made it to the shelter tonight and it is very cool but nice. There is a couple here whose son is thru hiking and they are trying to meet up with him. I set up my tent. It is still shorts hiking weather but having to put on my coat when I get to camp. Hog back Ridge Shelter to Whistling Gap (Mile 330.9)


Bald Mountain Shelter was only 10 miles so I did not want to stop since I really want to get far enough today to make it to Uncle Johnnies Hotel in Erwin, TN tomorrow in time to make the 5:00 dinner shuttle. Priorities. I stopped and filled up on water at the shelter. And then had to carry it for 3.5 miles because the water source was listed as iffy at my planned campsite. There are signs for water when I arrived but I am not even going to check if there is any here because I don’t want to know if I carried the extra weight for nothing. Besides, I wanted to get far enough to be sure I make it to Uncle Johnnies tomorrow in time for the dinner shuttle to town at 5:00.


Interesting terrain today since it was constantly changing. Foggy when I went over Big Bald so no views today.  Nice camping spot and a full moon.","

Made it to Uncle Johnny’s. I had reserved a private cabin but they screwed up my reservation so they put me in the luxury cabin for same price. Probably would not have been rented anyway. After a shower and doing laundry, got the shuttle to dinner and Walmart for resupply.


I had heard mixed reviews of Johnny’s and must say I agree. Everyone is friendly and nice and they picked me up in town outside of the normal shuttle run today. But let’s just say I am glad I am not paying full price for the luxury cabin. The place is not stocked and it is dirty. I had to go ask for more toilet paper. A fairly well stocked kitchen but no paper towels or hand towels. Microwave does not work. No shampoo and only 3 in 1 men’s body wash, shampoo and conditioner all in one. Dirty - cobwebs everywhere, greasy foil on top of toaster oven, stove and refrigerator both have stuff spilled on them and coffee maker has seen better days. They are right off the trail and I am not sure there is a better location because the town is so spread out that you cannot get everywhere by walking. Oh well, the sheets are clean and I am back on the trail tomorrow, rain or shine. Rain and cooler temperatures are predicted. ","

Left Uncle Johnny’s in the rain around 8:15. I thought about sticking around until the rain quit but I needed to move so headed out. I have a 3500 foot climb to Unaka  Mountain so might as well get to it. 


Made it to Curly Maple Gap Shelter around 10:30 and stopped for a snack. The rain had quit so I considered putting my rain jacket and pack cover away but decided it was a little cool so I kept my jacket on. Good thing because around noon, it started pouring and the wind was blowing and temperature dropping. At Indian Grave Gap, I ran into a couple waiting on a shuttle to take them to Uncle Johnny’s. I only had 4 more miles to camp so kept on moving. Then I came across a group of 3 men also leaving the trail. Maybe I should have followed. By time I got to camp, I was soaked and freezing. I broke my rule of not camping near a road (gravel forest road) but I have no choice. It would be dangerous to keep on going. I filled up with water and struggled to set up my tent in the wind, shivering the whole time. It felt so good to get my jacket on and into my sleeping bag to thaw out. I cooked dinner from my sleeping bag. It will probably be close to freezing tonight so I am putting on layers.
There was a tent set up near the road when I came down the trail. Just now, there was an older gentleman getting water so it was probably him. He yelled down to ask if I was OK. So good to know there is someone else around.","

The trail immediately climbed which was a good thing since I needed to warm up. My book said Unaka Mountain was a dense Spruce forest. All I was thinking was something to break the wind but the trees were covered in frost and it was beautiful. But it was so cold that as soon as I took one picture, my phone shut off. I wore my rain suit and gloves for warmth all day because the wind never stopped blowing. I decided to spend the night at Greasy Creek Hostel. Unfortunately, I missed my turn and by time I realized it, it was closer to head to the next shelter than to backtrack.  When I got to the shelter, the couple I saw on the trail the day before in the rain were there so Sonia, David and I talk until it was so cold, we went to bed.","

I climbed all morning. There were icycles and ice on ground which I realized was the ice that had formed on the trees falling to the ground. Made it to the top where there was a big clearing where an old hotel used to be. The Cloudland  Hotel that straddled the TN and NC line. You could drink in one state only so had to keep on the right side of the line. I was going to sit in the sun and eat lunch but a couple of bear hunters with their dogs came through so I decided to keep on moving. A little later on, I found a place in the sun to eat lunch. It felt so good. As soon I got back on the trail, I was in the forest again and got cold again. I eventually made it to Carver Gap where to my surprise, there were cars and people everywhere. They were all hiking up very slowly. I passed everyone and people were collapsing on the side of the trail. I promise it was not very steep.


Long day, 16 miles. Finally made it to Overmountain Shelter. There is a big barn that was used as the shelter until recently when it was closed and condemned due to structural issues. There is a big clearing in front and it is filled with tents.

Not quite as cold as the last two days but the wind was picking up. As soon as I started up an open ridge, it started hitting me. When I hit Bradley Gap and Hump Mountain, the wind was brutal. There were good views but it was overcast and I just focused on getting up and over. I actually got blown off the trail a few times. There were hardly any white blazes and at one point, I stopped and waited for a group coming up behind me to make sure I was still on the AT.



The last few miles were not bad and I finally warmed up enough to take my rain suit off and put on my shorts. After the third person said I needed to check out the breakfast at Mountain Harbour, as soon as I could get a cell phone signal, I called to make a reservation. The only thing available was the Tree House so I reserved it. Got in around 2:30 and took a shower and did laundry. Started to rain shortly after I got in. The Tree House has no heat or electricity, so I hung out at the bunk house charging my electronics and using the WiFi to catch up on email. Marathon John (thru hiker, 2013) was staying there while passing through and doing some day hikes. He took me up to the Station at 19E to pick up my food package mailed from home. We then went to dinner at a Mexican restaurant (no margaritas because it is a dry county) and stopped at Dollar General so I could get a few more resupply items.
Jackpot, aka Jackie, one of the resident cats at the bunkhouse jumped in my lap every time I sat down to use my iPad which was fine with me. I borrowed a headlamp to find my way out to the Tree House when I was ready for bed. The bed was so comfortable and I slept great. Of course, I was up at 5:30. So I organized my food stash and then went over and made coffee at 6:00. Great way to start the day. Grizzly, a SOBO thru hiker was also staying there and had lots of stories to tell.  Everyone else was doing some short 2-3 day backpacking trips and this was a popular spot for shuttle pickups.


Sure enough, breakfast was awesome. Fruit, various cakes, muffins and pastries, egg soufflé, potatoes, sausage, breakfast tacos, French toast, biscuits and gravy. I ate until I was stuffed then packed up to head out.","

Some SOBO hikers said there we’re plenty of running streams after the rain with camping spots nearby so I headed out. I am camped right next to a stream. Very soothing.
Upper Laurel Fork to Dennis Cove Road, Black Bear Resort (Mile 419.9)


Rain due in around midnight with close to freezing temps so I was trying to figure out what to do. I wanted to do more than 12 miles but I slipped twice today on wet leaves and rocks and was feeling tired. I could go 2 more miles to the next shelter or hit a hostel. I talked to Earth Surfer, SOBO thru hiker, and his dog Cabra. After getting updated on the trail, I decided it definitely was time to quit for the day. When I got to the road, I met an interesting local who was getting ready to do his root and rock run (where I will be hiking tomorrow). We talked for awhile then I headed down the road to the Black Bear Resort. I had a shower, washed a couple of things by hand. Then had frozen pizza and a Corona. Very tasty! And I have a heater in my cabin. 


Dennis Cove Road to Hampton, TN, Boots Off Hostel (Mile 428.4)


Slept in until 6:30. No rain and still warm. Went and made coffee and a little later started packing up. Then it finally started to rain. The front is about 8 hours behind schedule so I worked out a plan. Linda is going to drive my pack to the Boots Off Hostel in Hampton and I will leave in a couple of hours after the rain slacks off and slack pack today. Who cares how wet, cold and slippery it is since I won’t have a pack and another warm bed waiting for me at the end. 


Got on the trail a little before noon, just as the rain moved out. There were supposedly 600 steep rock steps down to the river with several rock jumbles thrown in for fun. I slipped and fell once. I am really glad I did not have my pack. I borrowed a small daypack to carry water and lunch. There was a wonderful waterfall at the bottom. Then the the trail followed the river including a rock ledge along a large rock wall. When the river covers the ledge, there is a bypass trail. After 3 miles, a long climb up to Hampton. 


Made it to Boots Off around 4:30. I have a small private cabin that is wonderful. AC, electric including lights, coffee maker, mini fridge, and outlet to charge your electronics plus a space heater.

Sure enough, a good piped spring so I stocked up. The trail crossed through a farmer‘s pasture at one point so I communed with the cows. Not unusual for the trail to cross private property.

Another 16 mile day but that leaves just 10 miles to Damascus tomorrow. Ran into some people I met at Black Bear Resort. There was also a group of young people.

Lots of outfitters drop people off at the end of trail and they ride back to town. Planned to stop at Saunders Shelter to eat lunch but it was a quarter mile off trail so I found a rock to sit on instead. More climbing in the afternoon. I was thinking there were no easy sections today because of rocks and roots. Then the trail merged with the Creeper Trail along the river so there was one easy section. Quite a few cyclists on the trail too. There was conflicting information in Guthook about water at the shelter so about a mile before, I stopped and filled up at a stream to be sure I was covered. Then had to carry it uphill of course. There are several section hikers at the shelter so we talked while fixing dinner and I got the scoop on the upcoming trail and shelters. 
Lost Mountain Shelter to Thomas Knob Shelter (Mile 498.9)
Cold this morning but sunny and it warmed up by afternoon. Some more awesome fall leaves and then lots of climbing. Leaves have dropped at higher elevations. I actually wore my sunglasses quite a bit today. A couple of open areas with good views but mostly killer rocks and lots of water. Apparently it rained a lot here a couple of days ago and now there are small streams running across the trail everywhere. Not many level areas to pitch a tent but I squeezed in between some trees. There are 3 guys camped nearby and they are gathering and sawing wood for a fire. Seems too windy to me. I went to get water and it is a long, steep trek but good flow. We are near the the Grayson Highlands where wild ponies have been introduced to control the brush on the Balds. One of the ponies was nearby and we scoped each other out. I was getting water and rinsing out my bandana and felt something licking my leg. It was the pony. I wish I had my camera.

Woke up to water dripping and a wet tent. It was not raining but very foggy and the wind was blowing it onto my tent so only that side was wet. I packed up a wet tent and headed out. Because of the fog, I was sorry I had not not gone further yesterday because I did not think I would see any more of the ponies. But the trail was still very rocky - small rocks, medium rocks, rock steps, rock slabs - very slow going. Just as I crossed into the Grayson Highlands State Park, the sun broke through so I sat on a bench and soaked up the sun for a few minutes. And I did see a few more ponies. I did not reach the Wise Shelter until 11:30 so was really glad I did not attempt to make it there the night before. Another beautiful day with varied scenery. I made it to the Old Orchard Shelter a little before 3:00. It was bright and airy around the shelter and I was tempted to stop but decided to push on for a few more miles. Made it to Hurricane Mountain Shelter around 5:30. The stream is flowing well so plenty of water but it is down in a ravine so kind of damp and dark.

I love mornings because everything is fresh, you are rested, usually no one on the trail. I was cruising along thoroughly enjoying myself until I arrived at a forest road and realized I was no longer on the AT. Fortunately, I was only a half mile off so half mile back to get on track.  Then the trail detoured around Comers Creek because the bridge is out. Just as I headed down to the road, it started to rain. I stopped off at the Hurricane Creek Campground to get my pack cover and raincoat on before heading up the 1 and 1/2 mile paved road detour. All uphill of course. The rain was not heavy but it was windy and temps were dropping.  I made it to Trimpi Shelter around 1:00. I ate lunch and checked out the water supply. Only 10 miles tomorrow to Partnership Shelter so the sensible thing is to stop for the day although it pains me to stop so early. I got out of my wet socks and shoes and into my sleeping bag. The rain has picked up and it feels good to be dry and warm while watching the rain falling and the leaves blowing in the wind. I am the only one here so I read all afternoon. There are not many thru hikers still on the trail and the short section hikers are probably avoiding the bad weather.


Trimpi Shelter to Mount Rogers Visitor Center (Mile 534.2)


Almost done and I am ready to go home. I woke up at 5:00 and the rain was gone and the stars were out. I waited until about 5:30 and made coffee then started packing up in the dark. Just feeling anxious and ready to move. By time it was light, the clouds were back and I headed out. There were a few rain showers then the sun came out and it was pretty warm.  I slipped and fell a couple of times today and thought of a couple of people I met on the trail, Sir Falls A Lot and Slip and Slide. I can relate. The trail followed a valley and you could see roads and farms for quite a while. Further south, you were more removed from civilization but now the trail winds closer to towns. The Partnership Shelter is right across from the Mount Rogers Visitor Center and when I saw the weather forecast for rain, heavy winds and temps near freezing plus a tornado warning, I decided to take the shuttle (50 cents) to town (Marion, VA) to get a hotel.  Checked in and got to my room about 5 seconds before the rain hit. It poured for hours and I did not want to go out in it so I decided to get pizza delivery. Just 12 miles left for this leg of of my journey. It has been fun but I am ready to go home.

My right knee is bothering me some so I was concerned about this last section. When I realized we would be going right by Marion on the way to the airport, I decided to slack pack this last 12 miles. I left my pack at the hotel, took the shuttle back to the visitor center and headed out a little before 9:00. Yesterday, I hiked in shorts and short sleeves and today it is freezing. It was low 30s and the shuttle driver was concerned I did not have warm enough clothes. Tights, long sleeve shirt, puffy jacket and gloves. I was fine as long as I kept moving. The morning was just repetitive up and down, leaves mostly dropped, not too interesting. It was snowing when I made it to the top of Glade Mountain. Made it to to the Chatfield Shelter at noon so I stopping and fixed a PBJ sandwich and ate quickly. Even though the sun was out by then, I got cold so had to get moving again. Hit long rhododendron tunnels then once again skirting farms in the valley. At one point, I thought the trail was adjacent to someone’s backyard but it was actually the Settler’s Museum. I checked out an old one room classroom from the late 1800s. Made it to the highway a little before 2:00. One quarter of the trail complete. I am done for now! Rambunny, my shuttle driver picked me up. We swing by to pick up my pack and she dropped me off at the hotel near the airport.

When the governor of VA started opening up the state and I figured there was minimal risk to myself and to others I come in contact with, I decided to head out. I want to hike but also support the trail community that has been hit hard in the last couple of months.


Not an auspicious start to my hike. My flight arrived in Roanoke around 9:15 pm. Flights were not too full but quite a few people were not wearing masks. When I went to pick up my rental car, they informed me my drop off location had been changed to Abingdon which is about 30 miles further from the trail. I don’t know how I am going to get to the trail now. Then I lost my mask while lugging my gear to the rental car in the pouring rain. No dinner options other than drive thru fast food so I hit Taco Bell on the way to my hotel. Unloaded half my stuff then locked myself out of my room. When I finally got to bed, could not sleep for thinking about how am I going to get to the trail. 

Next morning, after many phone calls, discovered I could still drop car off in Marion even though they are closed and drop keys in Drop Box. Taxi that I had arranged picked me up and we headed to to the trail. Not quite sure where I needed to be since the trail runs underneath the freeway here but then I saw the white blazes. I am so excited to finally be back. Starting out about 1:00.
Rural Retreat trailhead (Mile 546) to Crawfish Trail (Mile 552.3)


Last year I never once thought I needed sunscreen because you are usually under a tree canopy. The first 45 minutes were hot and sunny. I started to take a side trail to check out the Davis Cemetery but encountered  a flooded trail so back to the main trail. Then about 15 minutes later, the AT was flooded. So soaking wet shoes and socks right off the bat. But then the trail moved into the forest that I am used to. About two hours in, passed a sign saying I am 1/4 of the way from Georgia to Maine. There was a light rain the last hour or so but the trail wound through rhododendrons in bloom and temps cooled off so not bad. I passed one other hiker heading south and he gave me the scoop on the trail ahead. Said there was a group of 5 northbound thru hikers ahead of me. 


Made it to to my planned camping spot near a stream. About 7 miles total for the day. There is one other camper here. I waved and said hi but he ignored me. Unusual because most hikers are friendly. Got set up and rain picked up some so laid here and read my book. Eventually fixed dinner and discovered my water filter is not working. I cleaned it when I got off the trail last fall but did not check it before leaving. So saved the water I had for drinking and cooked with the stream water. It will be several days before I have an opportunity to buy a replacement. I have heard of people not filtering their water but I would hate to get sick from giardia. Laying here reading with a background of a running stream and some very vocal birds. A movement caught my eye. It was a deer browsing nearby.
Crawfish Trail to Lick Creek (Mile 564) 


Headed out about 7:45.  Asked the other camper which direction he was headed since I wanted to find out about a spring listed on the map. Spud is heading north like me and was very friendly and shared his water filter. I guess he did not hear me last night when I greeted him. 


After a few hours, the trail cut through a cow pasture and I apparently took one of the cow paths by mistake and lost the trail. At least there were lots of red winged blackbirds keeping me company. By time I made it back to the AT, Spud had caught up so we hiked together to the Knot Maul Branch Shelter where we stopped to rest and eat lunch. It was only 1:00 so too early to stop so pushed on. We heard the Lick Creek bridge was washed out so I was glad to be hiking with someone if we had to ford the stream. Sure enough, the water was about a foot deep and running pretty quick. I decided my cheap plastic camp shoes  were not a good idea so crossed in my shoes and socks. Yuck, wet shoes and socks again. By then it was 5:00 and there were some good camping spots nearby so decided to stop for the day. Almost 12 miles. So much for easing into this. Long climb tomorrow morning. As I am lying here writing, a hiker came by and called out apparently looking for his friends then moved on. We had not seen anyone else on the trail today.


Lick Creek to VA623 (Mile 575.9)


Next morning, had a 5 mile climb up to Chestnut Knob. The shelter is completely enclosed, apparently to protect you from the weather since it is very windy and no trees for protection. Suddenly there were several groups of people. Turns out, there is a parking area just a few miles down the hill and day trippers are out for the Memorial Day weekend. We finally made it to a road crossing after 12 miles or so and I was beat. My feet were killing me. The damp shoes and socks are really irritating them. Someone had left jugs of water which was great because there is no water source and I was low. Even though there were no good camping spots, there were storms in the area and we did not relish the the thought of 4 more uphill miles to the next shelter. So we scrounged around until we found some reasonably level areas to pitch our tents. Got set up and fixed dinner. I cleaned up and got in my tent just in time before a major storm hit.


VA623  to US 52 (Mile 591.7) 


Next morning, found a big puddle in the foot of my tent where the wind blew the rain up under my rain fly. So packed up a wet tent and sleeping bag. My feet felt better so headed out. The trail was great, no rocks and fairly flat although I had to stop and tape some hot spots on my feet but made it to Jenkins Shelter in 4.5 miles. It was really pretty and peaceful there and I was tempted to stop for the day and let my feet have time to heal. But it was only 10:30 so headed out.  My feet got progressively worse over the next few  miles and I eventually took off my hiking shoes and hiked in in my camp shoes when the trail headed downhill. Made it to Laurel Creek which was more a raging river. I soaked my feet in the icy water and bandaged up my feet good and headed out. We had already hiked 8.5 miles but the next shelter was still 11 miles away. My feet kept getting worse but there was no water and no decent camping spots along the trail. I know how to push through being tired and exhausted but not sure how to deal with throbbing feet. I hobbled along for another 7 miles and finally made it to the road into Bland. Spud was waiting for me but I decided I had to get off the trail. I just hurt too much and was looking for a shuttle driver since town was 3 miles away. Found Weary Feet Hostel and they said they would come pick me up. I got dinner and a shower and tomorrow will do laundry. I am thinking I must have contact dermatitis from the wet wool or something because I wore these same shoes and socks last year with no problems. I put antibiotic ointment on my feet and will figure out what to do next in the morning.


US 52 to VA 606 (Mile 609.7) 


I promise this is the last I will talk about my feet. They feel much better and I think I have solved the mystery. I realized it looked like poison oak I got when living in California and then had my eureka moment. Because I am getting into Lyme disease territory, I treated my clothes including my socks with permethrin (as recommended) to keep the ticks away. I am having a reaction to the insecticide. I got a ride into Dollar General and bought some cortisone cream and some new socks. Also bought batteries since the ones in my headlamp are almost dead. By dinner, I was feeling better so made plans to slackpack (hike without a pack) the next day to see how I do.


The hostel shuttled me back to the trailhead where I got off the trail. Had  a pretty good climb up from the road but then a nice trail through a spring green tunnel with lots of ridge walking and cool temps. A few light showers in the afternoon. And my feet felt great. It was about 15 miles to get back to the trail to the hostel. I was aiming for Mile 606 so when I made it to 606.5 and no signs, I texted for directions. Turns out I need highway 606. Still 3 more miles to go. I was tired but just started walking. A couple of miles later, I came across a massive blowdown. The tree was huge and I had to climb down the hill over large branches, dead trees, thorny vines grabbing at me. It took at least 10 - 15 minutes to work my way back onto the trail. Then it really started to rain. But I finally made it back, 18 miles later.  Feeling good after a shower and dinner and sitting here listening to the rain. 
VA 606 to Woods Hole Hostel (Mile 625.3)


It rained all night and when I looked out this morning, the river was up and running fast. The platform next to the river was submerged. Since the map showed streams and footbridges the first 9 miles of the trail, I am apprehensive of how safe the trail will be. I decided to walk the road to the trail but it was under water so headed back to the side trail that takes you up to the AT. It was a short hike to the suspension bridge and the river was up over the steps to the bridge. There was a hiker who had camped near the bridge who was getting ready to cross so I followed him. The river was not moving fast but was knee high getting to the steps. After I crossed, the steps down put me out into water up to my thighs. Later I realized my phone was in my shorts pocket and got wet. It is not working right but at least it is still working.


When I got to the road, I decided to walk the half mile to Trent’s Grocery for a breakfast sandwich. Was it worth walking a mile for a sausage and egg biscuit? Yep.


When I got back to trail, there was a young guy walking to his camp at Dismal Falls so we hiked and talked for the first couple of miles. About 75% of the trail was underwater. It was like walking up a stream or in a lake. All of the footbridges were in place but you had to wade through a stream to get to one and another dropped you off in a lake. I could not even tell where the trail was at first. I reached Wapiti Shelter after 8 miles. Ran into a group of hikers I met at the hostel the night before. 


I thought the worst was over but there was still a mile and a half climb through an icy stream. The sun was out and it was getting warm so the icy water kept you cool. There were a couple of streams with no footbridges that were kind of scary. You had to study it and figure out the best place to cross. Took me several tries on one stream.


I was having trouble locking my phone so random apps kept opening. At one point, music started playing but I decided it was a nice addition to a crappy day - as long as my battery lasted.


Finally made it to Woods Hole Hostel. It is one of the oldest hostels on the trail. Neville took it over in 2009 after her grandmother died. She was teaching a yoga class on the porch when I arrived so I quickly pulled off my wet shoes and socks and joined in. She has livestock and an organic garden. Her lettuce and greens looked great. 



The group of hikers from lunch were staying in the bunkhouse and I had the main house to myself. It was great to drink coffee on the porch swing watching the sun come up the next morning. It was a great place to rest and relax.
Woods Hole Hostel to Pearisburg, VA (Mile 637)


Trail was wet and muddy but not as bad as yesterday. Most of the morning was hiking through rhododendron tunnels which are dark and cool. The forest opened up in the afternoon. It’s amazing how a change in elevation of just a few hundred feet makes a difference in whether the trees are leafed out yet.  Temps are warming up,so I want as much shade as possible. There were a couple of views of the valley below. I stopped at Angels Rest which is a big rock with a view of the town below. Then a long wet and muddy descent to the road. I am taking a zero day tomorrow at Angels Rest Hiker Haven Hostel. Time to rest my legs and resupply since I am almost out of food.","

Zero day at Angels Rest Hiker Hostel. I talked to a couple of guys I met at Trent’s Grocery when I walked over to the laundry room. They are staying in the bunkhouse but once again, I have the main house to myself. Walked over to the grocery store for a bottle of wine and had pizza delivered. I spent the next day working on work emails. Unfortunately, the library is closed so I have to work on my mini iPad which takes twice as long to do anything. I walked over to Mexican restaurant for lunch and later went to the grocery store to resupply my food. 


Pearisburg to VA 365/Stony Creek (Mile 657. 3) 



Slackpacking today to rack up some miles. The shuttle driver picked me up at 7:30 and dropped me off back at the trailhead. I am doing a 20 mile slackpack and he will bring me my pack late this afternoon. 


The first mile or so is along the highway on a bridge that goes over the railroad tracks and the river then skirts a chemical plant. When you get back into the woods, there is a easy uphill until you reach the landfill. Then a medium climb until you get to the ridge. I saw several deer. Last year, I saw only one deer in over 500 miles. I think I have seem them every single day this year. I don’t know if it is the time of the year or that there are fewer people on the trail.
I got into a rhythm in spite of the climb and was feeling a little homesick when I heard some crashing in the woods and it was my first bear siting on the AT, a mama bear and two cubs a little ways off the trail. I tried to take pictures but typical kids, they would not be still. They climbed a tree then came down and ran to another and climbed it. And the whole time mama was keeping an eye on me. I finally raised my arms high and loudly said I am coming through now. She quickly turned and headed down the hill at that point. Definitely the high point of my day. 



The trail followed the ridge for several miles then the trail cut through a big thicket with lots of blackberries in bloom. The plant life became really dense on the forest floor. Then the trail turned into rock slabs which are awkward to maneuver through so I get real slow. There were two trail volunteers clearing some of the growth over the trail through this section. A little later, a big black snake startled me. He moved really quick and it was apparent he was not happy with me but no big deal, not one of the poisonous ones. The trail eventually headed downhill cross multiple streams but there were lots of blowdowns so a little tricky getting around them. The trail volunteers have not been out much in the last few months to clear the trails. Makes you appreciate what they do. Finally made it to the road and Broccoli, the shuttle driver was waiting for me with my pack. After 20 miles, I was beat so found a place to camp next to the river.
Stony Creek to War Spur Shelter (Mile 669)


It was 45 degrees last night. Great sleeping weather after that long day. I crashed by 8:30. When I headed out, the trail wound around up and down along the river then a steep 2 mile climb followed by more rock jumbles. When the trail headed downhill, it was washed out with big ruts and loose rock. Met quite a few women on the trail today. There were other section hikers like me and one woman I met a few days ago. She is doing a series of slackpack hikes. There is a guy who specializes in helping people coordinate their hikes. I planned to stop at Wind Rock which has a view but there were several kids already staking a claim and talking about partying and getting drunk so I moved on. When I made it to the shelter, two sisters I met this morning were already there. They are sleeping in the shelter but I set up my tent. There is a wooden bench next to my camping spot. I have never seen that before. It is a real nice area and I can hear the creek nearby.  I always sleep better when camped by a stream.


War Spur Shelter to Sarver Hollow Shelter (Mile 681.2)


Great morning. On the trail by 7:45. Started out with an easy trail then a moderate uphill through a tunnel of laurels in full bloom. The trail eventually followed an old fire or forest road that was very steep but when you reached the top, it was a nice walk a ridge. Made it to the Laurel Creek Shelter about noon and stopped for lunch. About a minute after leaving, hit Laurel Creek so stocked up on water since no water sources listed on the map for the afternoon. 


After such a great morning, it went downhill. The trail cut through several meadows that were just a swath mowed through it. Exposed to the sun and it was really warming up. Came to a road and the map was confusing so turned on the road. After about 5 minutes, it did not seem right so checked Guthooks and sure enough, I was off the trail. I backtracked and got back on the trail. The next hour or so was meadows, brief respites of woods, then power lines right of way. And then another steep uphill. Eventually made it to the ridge and an easy trail but so tired and hot at that point, it did not matter. Finally made it to the shelter but it was 0.4 mile down a steep path. No choice though because I am almost out of water. It is a nice shelter area but very rocky and down another steep path to the spring. Dee and Dawn showed up and they are as beat as me. Then a college kid showed up so full house tonight. And now there is a crazy loud bird serenading us. Very distinctive call but no idea what it is. Later decided it was a whip-poor-will.


Sarver Hollow Shelter to Pickle Branch Shelter (Mile 697.3)


On the trail at 7:40 but it is cruel and unusual punishment to have to immediately start a steep climb. Once I got back to the AT, the trail followed the ridge with small ups and downs but multiple sections of slanted slabs of rock. They are kind of fun to maneuver but a little tricky keeping your balance with a pack. I would hate to hit this section in the rain.  I would probably just get down and scoot on my butt. Made it to the Niday Shelter and rested and had lunch with Dee and Dawn. The miles before and after the shelter were some of the prettiest I have seen on the trail so far. Lots of different types of trees including pines that smell really good. And lots of laurels still blooming. We crossed a road and a series of streams with footbridges. Stocked up on water for the climb ahead.


Then we hit the 3 mile uphill climb. The first third was pretty and gentle switchbacks. The next third more moderate and the final third was a killer. And by then it was really hot. When you finally break out on top, there is a wooden bench which I promptly claimed so I could eat a snack to fuel me for the next section. The trail is a swath through the woods that is hot and sunny. About a half mile later, there is a memorial to Audie Murphy. He died in a plane crash nearby. The trail finally moves back into the woods with more ups and downs. I discovered there is a parking lot nearby for people visiting the memorial hence the series of benches.


Dee and Dawn decided to stop and camp along the way but I decided to go 4 more miles to Pickle Branch Shelter so I could I could get water for dinner and coffee in the morning.


Hit Trout Creek and filled my liter bottle with water for just in case no water at the shelter scenario. Then a one mile steep climb. I did not make it to the shelter until almost 7:00. That last mile uphill was a killer. First thing I did was check out the water situation. It was a fast running stream so I rinsed out my hair and cleaned and filled up. 


Since no one else was here I decided to sleep in the shelter. It is pretty warm so I hope i can sleep. As I was fixing dinner, the college kid I met last night showed up. He is camped up at the top of the hill so apparently I walked right past him. He had not seen anyone all day so happy to hang out and talk. He left when it started to get dark. After going to bed, I started getting bit by gnats or something. Another reason I don’t like shelters. There was no where nearby to set up a tent so I set mine up inside the shelter. Problem solved. I heard rustling which probably was mice but my pack is hung up so should be OK.


Pickle Branch Shelter to VA 624 (Mile 704)


Took my time since a short day and I am in no hurry. Little did I know. Started with easy trail then moderate climb to the ridge. Rocky up and down then more climbing. I kept thinking I was at top but always another uphill. Finally made it to Dragon’s Tooth with big jagged rocks that look like teeth and then the fun began. There are sections called the Ledges. The slabs that were tilted before are now completely on their side and you walk and climb on the edges of the slabs. Many times you have to drop your poles so you can use your hands to hang on. There were steel rungs embedded in the rock a couple of times to help you across large spans of rock. I learned that sometimes it is easier to climb butt first. If you can get your butt up on a ledge and then pull your legs up and over, it is easier than trying to step up on a rock three to four feet high. Then reverse the process going down. Then it went from really, really hard to just really hard then just plain hard. And the whole section is in the sun so it is really hot. I started getting nauseated as I always do when overexerting myself in the heat. Eventually the trail moves back into the forest and continues to have some really difficult rocky sections interspersed on the trail. Finally the last mile or so is just normal switchbacks to the road. I am heading to Four Pines Hostel to shower and wash clothes. Then to the Catawba Store for a cheeseburger. 
The hostel is pretty primitive, set up in someone’s garage. Jim and Donna are nice and hospitable but the place runs on donations and is kind of a hobby I guess. Ti am OK with primitive but the place was dirty. Most hostels provide shampoo and body wash for the shower. This one just had a big bottle of liquid hand soap and no towels so I dried off (sort of) with my dirty and bloody bandana (caught my arm on a jagged branch when climbing on the ledges). Just about to do laundry when a downpour started but moved through pretty quickly. I washed clothes but the spin cycle did not work so ended up with a pile of sopping clothes and no dryer. Rung them out and hung them on the clothesline but by then it had clouded up so not sure if they will dry. Just before dark, I brought my clothes in and hung them inside. No one else here tonight but one hiker and his dog.


VA 624 to Laurel Meadows Shelter (Mile 720.3)


Fairly easy morning except that it is so hot and muggy. Stopped at Johns Spring  Shelter and rested and had a snack. Made it to McAfee Knob which is one of the most famous landmarks on the trail. Ran into Traveling Man and Compass and the dog, Stella Blue who I also met briefly at 4 Pines. It started to rain so did not stay long. I headed to the Campbell Shelter and stopped for lunch and to refill my water. The rain stopped but lots of thunder all around. I decided to push on for 6 more miles so I have a shorter day tomorrow to get to Daleville. About 10 minutes after I got back on the trail, the storm hit. I saw a rock ledge and squeezed me and my pack under it. I was able to sit on a rock and keep a little bit protected while it is thunder and lightning all around me. Crazy loud and scary because it was right on top of me. I am sure glad I was not out on the trail totally exposed. After 20 minutes or so, back on the trail and shoes and socks are soaked again. 


Eventually made it to the Tinker Cliffs, giant rock formations that drop off forming cliffs but covered in lots of trees and foliage. Pretty cool. These last 3 sections (Dragons’s Tooth, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs) are called the Triple Crown. I did not get to the shelter until 7:40. It was tempting to stay in the shelter since it was already late. But mosquitoes came out after the rain and I am afraid they will be out in full force. So I scouted around and discovered there were good camping spots next to the creek around the bend. So I set up camp in the mud. Had to cook dinner by headlamp. But the rain had cooled things down and the sound of the creek was so soothing that I slept great.


Lamberts Meadow Shelter to VA 220 (Mile 729.7)


I woke around 6:30 but it was raining so I dozed off until 7:45. Only 10 miles today so no rush to get going. I did not leave camp until 9:45. I discovered another minute or two down the trail, there was an even better camping spot with a picnic table and bear box. The first 6 miles were pretty easy then I hit more rock piles that were a little more challenging. The rain flattened out the grass in places and washed piles of leaves over the trail so it was sometimes hard to find the trail. I ended up on hands and knees on one slippery rock ledge when I discovered I was way off course and had to climb back up the slope.  It is a really pretty trail through here and quite a few day hikers out since it is the weekend. The last mile or two was easy switchbacks. Finally made it to the highway around 3:00. Had to to walk almost a mile along busy streets to get to my hotel.  But a shower, ice water and food waiting for me is worth it.


Tomorrow is a zero day in Daleville/Troutville, not sure where one town ends and the other starts. ","

18.5 miles plus the 0.9 miles to get from the hotel to the trail. I am glad I did not know going in that was what I was going to do.





The morning was nice and easy. The first part of the trail followed along the highway so even though walking in the woods, I was serenaded by traffic noise. But finally left the city behind and had one open meadow to transverse. Stopped at Fullhardt Knob Shelter to rest and have a snack. There was a young couple there who said they resupplied in Daleville and hiked the 5 miles to this shelter yesterday. It was around 11:15 and they were working on getting started for the day. Then they both smoked a cigarette and then fired up the bong. Not sure if they will ever get going.
There were lots of stream crossings mid day with a little more ups and downs. Then the trail intersects with the Blue Ridge Parkway, crisscrossing a couple of times. There is not much traffic on the parkway but there usually isn’t when I have been here in the past. Then the trail got really rocky for awhile, either small rocks that hurt your feet or bigger ones to maneuver over. Often the trail runs through clearings on the side of the mountain where trees were cleared to provide overlooks on the parkway. Around 5:30, I hit an overlook with a picnic table so I stopped and rested and checked out the view. It was shady with a nice breeze. 
I still had 2.5 miles more to go so back on the trail. The trail smoothed out at that point and was not too bad. The trail headed downhill as I got closer to the shelter and then there was a 0.2 mile side trail downhill even more. All I was thinking was how hot it’s going to be at this low elevation. Finally got here at 7:10. My tent was packed up damp the other day so I put up the rainfly to dry off but I may take it off after it dries to get what little breeze there is. No rain expected until Wednesday.


While I fixed dinner, there was a doe browsing nearby. She did not seem to be concerned about me at all. Very quiet now except for the birds.


Bobblets Gap Shelter to Bryant Ridge Shelter (Mile 761.7)


Even though it was warmer than I like, I slept good. I guess if you are tired enough. Headed about about 8:00. Heavy fog so no views from the overlooks. The morning was a repeat of yesterday afternoon except a few areas of laurels in bloom. Stopped at Cove Mountain Shelter Shelter for lunch. Then easy trail to Jennings Creek. Nice place to swim. Talked to a guy who has hiked in the area a lot and he said in a normal year, there would be a ton of hikers there on a hot day like this. 

There is a climb as you leave the creek and there must have been 4 or 5 large trees down in the first quarter mile or so which I had to scramble over, under or around. It was recent because the leaves are still green. I guess it was from a storm because some of the trees topple over and the entire root ball pulls out of the ground. The climb up to Fork Mountain is about a mile and a half and with the heat, it about did me in. I arrived at Bryant Ridge Shelter about 4:30. I was hoping to make it to the next shelter but it is 5 more miles uphill in the heat. That is not an option.
I checked the weather when I was up on the mountain and chance of rain starting in the morning. So I set up my tent without the rainfly to get more air. I could hear thunder while fixing dinner and there were a few very light showers so put up the rainfly after all. And it is really hot. Now I wish it would storm and cool things down.


An older couple (like me) showed up while I was cooking dinner. They set up their hammock and tent inside the shelter. A couple of people I met on the trail raved about the shelter because it is two story. I am just happy with my tent. I enjoyed talking to them before heading to bed.


Bryant Ridge Shelter to campsite at Mile 775.1


Started the long climb first thing but as much as I dreaded it, I made good time. After seeing very other hikers on the trail, I saw several people going southbound as I started getting closer to the Cornelius Creek Shelter. One was a woman lying on the ground. She said she did not have room to put her pack inside her tent last night so everything got wet and now her pack was too heavy. So she had carried her pack a ways up the trail and left it and was laying in the sun with the rest of her stuff trying to dry it  out. She said she was giving up and heading back to her car and going home to Pennsylvania. I also saw one of of the women slackpackers I keep running in to. She said Dee and Dawn had camped at Jennings Creek last night. So they are only a few miles behind me.


I stopped at Cornelius Creek Shelter for lunch. There was a young man doing trail magic. He had sodas, beer, candy and ice cream. My first trail magic so far. I was excited to get something cold to drink. I grabbed what I thought was a sparkling water but it turned out to be a lime flavored beer. Oh well, it sure made my cheese and crackers taste better. Then an ice cream sandwich for dessert. He is a grad student at Virginia Tech and kind of in limbo for the summer since jobs and internships have dried up. He said he prefers day hiking. I told him my favorite thing is to stay at National Park Lodges, hike all day and come back to my room for a shower and a glass of wine. So what am I doing here?


Back on the trail. Some more climbing, more rocks, rhododendrons in bloom but lots of variety. There were some cool dark and damp sections where all the rocks are covered in moss and lichens. Since I spend a lot of time looking down, I also see lots of little critters. I am not too fond of the centipedes but I enjoy seeing the bright orange newts, lizards, lots of different sizes of frogs and turtles. Today, I saw a turtle kind of half way tilted in whole. Not sure if it was intentional or he was stuck, but I pulled him out and put him back on the trail. He can go back if he wants.


Made it to Thunder Hill Shelter around 3:00. I did not want to stop yet but wanted to know what the weather was going to do. I walked back up the trail uphill a ways and got a signal. A chance of rain this afternoon and tonight but looks like rain all day tomorrow. I decided to get in a few more miles while the weather is good so less time hiking in the rain tomorrow since I am heading to a hostel in Glasgow. I need at least one resupply to get me to Waynesboro. My hiker hunger has definitely kicked in. I need more food for my lunches.


Of course, it started to rain about 30 minutes after I headed out. But just light showers. I was headed to a spring with some camp sites near by. I was really glad to get here because there was absolutely nowhere else to camp along the way. It is super windy so I checked for widow makers since I don’t want any trees or limbs crashing down on me. I can hear trees creaking and branches breaking in the wind which is a little unnerving but nothing I can do about it.


Mile 775.1 to James River Bridge (Mile 786.5)


Woke up to light rain, dosed for awhile. When I got up, wind and rain were gone. Nice trail most of the day but always a few rocky sections. Could not not find a spot to stop for lunch so sat on a mossy area on the side of the trail. Then a long downhill to the James River. Those long downhills kill my knee. I an staying at Stanimal Hostel in Glasgow tonight. Charlie picked me up at the footbridge. As always, it feels so good to get a shower and wash clothes. ","

Another milestone, 800 miles.
Since the trail has a lot of uphills today and my pack is heavy after resupplying, I decided to slackpack today. I am going to hike 11 miles to Punchbowl Mountain Overlook on the BRP and Charlie will bring me my pack at 2:00. Maybe I overdid it with the town food because I was not feeling too good when I started out. It was a beautiful day, cool and sunny but I had to make a couple of emergency stops and then got really hot and was sweating like crazy. I thought I maybe had food poisoning. I stopped around noon and ate a little snack and then started feeling better.
At one point, the trail was really grown up and I wondered if I was still on the trail. I checked Guthooks and it showed I was off the trail. There were no white blazes so I backtracked to a big rock slab and scouted all over for blazes. Nothing so decided I must be on the right trail after all. When I got back to where I turned back, Guthooks still showed me as off trail. I tapped the app to refresh and suddenly, oh sorry, you really are on the trail. Thanks a lot. I made it to the overlook right at 2:00 and talked to a guy who was heading out southbound. His daughter and grandkids were his shuttle. Then Charlie showed up with my pack and I headed out. Just 4 miles to a campsite near the river.
I made it to the river and after I crossed the bridge, there were signs saying no camping next to reservoir. I checked my map and it said the campsite was 0.2 mile back so I backtracked but could not find anything that looked suitable for camping. I ended up walking about 10 minutes back to the spring to get water. Slow flow so I only got a little over a liter. When I headed back up the trail, I saw a spot that was less than ideal but decided it would work since it was almost 6:00 by then.
Just finished a book by a woman who read Cheryl Strayed’s book “Wild” and decided at age 69 to do a thru hike of the AT. Even though she had never hiked, never camped, did not like the outdoors and had an extreme, irrational fear of bears and other wildlife. Go figure. She did not finish but did make it about to where I am now on the trail so not bad. I hear a lot of people decide to hike the AT or PCT after reading “Wild” or Bill Bryson’s “A Walk in the Woods” (or more likely seeing the movies made from these books).
Pedlar River Bridge to Hog Camp Gap (Mile 814.8)
Since the spot where I camped was not real level, I slid around in my tent and had to rearrange myself several times. And it was a little challenging to find a flat spot to set up my stove but I managed. Headed out about 7:45. About 10 minutes past the bridge I saw a good camping spot. Maybe AWOL’s guide said south instead of north of the bridge by mistake.
Fairly easy morning, crossing several streams. Made it to Brown Mountain Creek Shelter at 10:20. Kind of early for lunch but a long climb coming up so I needed to eat. There was a large stream close by so I also stocked up on water. This area was once a settlement of freed slaves who grew crops such as corn, wheat and oats. The forest must have been much less dense back then. I saw remnants of old rock walls and rock foundations. They sold the land to the forest service in the 1920s.
When I left the shelter, the trail was a moderate uphill followed the creek. I saw a section with lots and lots of small pine trees, 1 - 2 feet high up to 12 feet or so. I know pines need fire for the pine cones to pop and disperse its seeds. I did not see any evidence of a fire but there could have been one years back.
There are trees down across the trail regularly. The goal is to get by without taking off your pack. Some you step over. You have to straddle the bigger ones and some are so big, you look for a rock or root to boost your butt up so you can swing your legs up and over. Some are high enough you can walk under. Then there are the ones you can walk under bent over at the waist and hope you don’t snag your pack and the final option is to do the limbo under it. But doing the limbo with a pack on your back and a bad knee does not work well unless the tree is small enough to grab hold of to support your weight as you pull through. If none of the above are an option then hopefully you can go around.
Today I came upon a large tree down with with its root ball blocking the trail right as the switchback crossed a stream on a hill. Going over was not an option. The only way to get through was push your pack under the tree and then get down on the ground and shimmy through. I did not want to do that so it became a contest to see if I could get around this tree without taking off my pack. I had to find a large root to use as a handhold that would not give way when I hoisted myself up. Then step up on rocks that were embedded in the rootball without giving way. I made it over and realized there was a second tree or trunk that I needed to get over so repeated the process. But victory, I did it.
The trail started a long climb for about 4 miles. It seems like these steep climbs never get easier. And there were several false summits. I was certain I was at the top then another hill. When I finally made it to the real top of the mountain, I ate a snack and checked the weather since I had cell service. A chance of rain in the next few days but cooler temperatures too. Woohoo!
Some more ups and downs. Quite a few people out since it is Saturday. I made it to Hog Camp Gap that has a big meadow along side a forest service road with camping spots. There are a couple of groups already set up. I found a small clearing and dropped my pack just as a few raindrops started but I got my tent up and everything in it just as the rain picked up. Since I did not have a chance to go and get water at the spring, I am collecting rain water as it runs off my tent to use for fixing dinner. I was hoping the rain would stop but gave up and cooked dinner from my tent around 6:00. The rain finally stopped at 7:30 but everything has a layer of dirt or mud on it now. About 8:15, I decided to go and get water for tomorrow. When I unzipped my tent, I discovered the group camping across me from had packed up and left. I had 0.3 mile trek to get water but better to get it out of the way tonight.
Hog Camp Gap to Priest Mountain Shelter (Mile 829.1)
No more rain during the night and nice cool temperatures. The trail headed out across the meadow. Although my shoes were dry when I started, within a short time my shoes and socks were soaking wet from the wet grass and plants along the trail. But the trail was pretty easy all morning. I stopped at Seeley-Woolworth Shelter for lunch. 58 degrees and overcast plus sitting on a damp picnic bench chilled me so I ate lunch and headed out to get warm. There was a section of blooming laurels and rhododendrons that was very nice. After I crossed Spy Rock Road, the trail was steep and rocky for a half a mile until the cut off to Spy Rock. I heard it had good views so I took the side trail. About half way, the trail got steep with high rock steps. So I dropped my pack and hurried to the end. The trail eventually crosses over a huge rock face. Great panoramic view at top. I did not stay long because rain expected again late this afternoon.
The last 5 miles were a little more difficult but made it to the Priest Mountain Shelter at 4:30. I was considering staying in the shelter since rain was expected. There was a pack in the shelter so I wondered who it belonged to. There was a stream right by the shelter so I collected water and filtered it. Then I walked back up the trail to the ridge to see if I could get a phone signal to check the weather. No luck. When I got back, no one had showed up to claim the pack. Then I noticed the floor of the shelter was level with my waist. To get in or out, I would have to step up or down on to the picnic bench at least a two foot drop or leap onto the picnic table. There was a disaster in the making if (not if, when) I had to get up during the night. Two SOBO hikers showed up to rest and fix dinner before getting in a few more miles and we talked for awhile. They thought the abandoned pack was strange too so late in the day. I decided I was not at all comfortable staying at the shelter. I had seen a spot up top on the other side of the trail, so I hiked back up and set up my tent here. I heard the 2 hikers leave but otherwise very quiet. Fog is rolling in but no rain so far.
Priest Mountain Shelter to Maupin Field Shelter (Mile 842.9)
No rain during the night and the fog was gone. The trail headed up and over the peak before starting downhill for about 4 miles. It was rocky at first but settled in to moderate switchbacks down to VA 56 and a suspension bridge over the Tye River. Another short climb and I made it to Harpers Creek Shelter by noon for lunch.
The trail started climbing right away when I left the shelter. And then there were rocks! A huge rock slide caused big rock jumbles. My pace really slowed down and then it started to drizzle. Great, now there are wet, slippery rocks. Actually the rain held off until I got close to the top. I did not want to put on my raincoat because it gets too hot. But when I finally reached the top, the rain and wind chilled me so I stopped and put on my raincoat and pack cover. Of course, it stopped raining then. But going downhill, I needed it to keep warm. And the rocks continued on the downhill. I was really sick of rocks. The last mile or so was not too bad but then it had started to rain again. I hear Pennsylvania is know for its rocks. Can’t wait!
When I got to the shelter at 5:30, there were a few tents set up but no one in the shelter. I was tempted to stay in the shelter to avoid setting up my tent in the rain. So I sat and ate a snack and contemplated what to do. A man and his kids that were camping nearby came by and said they were going to come over and cook in the shelter. I then had an idea. I setup my tent in the shelter then moved it to a camping spot outside. Then moved my gear inside so it did not get wet. I collected and filtered water from the creek and fixed dinner while talking to these people. And finally moved in and got in my sleeping bag to get warm.
One thing I have learned is that no matter how difficult a day you have or how miserable you are, the next morning is a clean slate and you forget about yesterday and start over with a fresh attitude. I think the only people who stay on the trail for a lengthy time are those who think like that. A good philosophy for life in general too.
Some more hikers have showed up. There was a guy yelling so I thought it was a rowdy bunch but he just told me there was a bear circling around on the ridge above of us and he was just trying to get him to move on.
Maupin Field Shelter to Paul Wolfe Shelter (Mile 858.7)
Overcast but no rain when I woke up. As I was heading out, I talked to the guy who was yelling at the bear. He said they fixed dinner and the bear watched them the entire time they were eating. After he yelled, the bear moved over to the creek but did not leave. So they picked up camp and moved up the hill to get further away. I was oblivious so slept just fine in spite of our visitor. 
The first few miles to the Three Ridges Overlook were easy but my legs were feeling a little tired. That is unusual then I realized this was my 9th straight day of hiking since I did not take a zero this week. And yesterday was a little challenging. When I got to the overlook, I saw a trashcan and decided to empty out 5 days of trash and eat a snack. Ended up talking to the bear guys from camp last night, plus a man and his son I saw on the trail yesterday, plus a couple of men and their dog who were hiking to look at plants. Then a guy came by on bicycle. He is on day 6 of a cross country bicycle trip from Yorktown, VA to Oregon. He said he was frustrated at how aggressive and unfriendly the drivers were on the roads so far although the parkway was fine. I got back on the trail feeling all energized. I love the solitude of the trail and having a lot of alone time but with such few hikers out this year, I realize I have had a little too much alone time.
At this point the trail turned into mostly rocks. Every kind and size of rock. I did stop at Cedar Cliffs for lunch and sit on a big rock slab with a great view. After awhile it started to rain a little and the rest of the afternoon was light rain showers or drizzle off and on but nothing major. When I made it to the trail cut off to Humpback Rock, I decided to check it out since it was only .25 mile but the trail quickly became quite steep going down so changed my mind. It was 3:30 and I still had 5.4 miles to go. I thought there was another climb but I was mistaken and the last 5 miles were easy with only a few rocks. Thank goodness. I got to a large, fast running stream. There were lots of rock crossing options but the rocks were wet and I was tired so a little stressful getting across. And then when I looked up, I realized I was at the shelter. It was after 6:00 and the rain was starting to pick up so I dropped my pack off and collected water. The shelter is nice and the picnic table is under cover. And the rain had really picked up so decision made. Even though I had seen several notices about bear activity at this shelter, I decided to stay here in the shelter since I am the only one here. No wet and muddy tent to pack up in the morning. A little while later a woman walked by with her dog so maybe someone else is camped nearby.
Paul Wolfe Shelter to Rock Fish Gap (Mile 863.7)
It rained off and on all night but no bear sitings. After having coffee, it is hard to get out of my sleeping bag and get moving. It is so calm and beautiful looking out at the dripping trees and I can hear the creek which is just a short way down the hill. I saw the woman and dog again. No hurry since only 5 miles today to Rock Fish Gap to get a ride into Waynesboro. My original plan was to make it to Waynesboro this section. If I made good time, I might push through Shenandoah National Park. I did make good time, but the park is just opening up and not all facilities are are operating in full mode. Part of the appeal of the Shenandoahs is being able buy meals and snacks at the waypoints so you don’t need to carry a weeks worth of food. Not everything is completely open. Plus, I have not been as productive for work as intended with the libraries being closed so feel like I need to get back to work. And I miss my husband and my dogs and I am ready to go home. Hope to be back again in the fall to do some more miles. When I made it to the road, I called Stanimal’s Hostel and they are coming to pick me up. Hot shower, clean clothes and food here I come.

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631276,"-----Forwarded Message----->Day 1: Rockfish Gap (863.7) to Calf Mountain Shelter (871.4) = 7.7 miles>Flew into Charlottesville last night and got an Uber to Stanimal’s hostel in Waynesboro. Dropped off at the trail in Rockfish Gap a little before 11:00. Met David walking to the trailhead at the southern end of Shenandoah National Park so we hiked together to the shelter with a brief stop for lunch. Arrived around 3:30. By time it got dark around 7:30, there were around 15 people camped here.>>Calf Mountain Shelter to Blackrock Hut (884.4) = 13 miles>Trail is not too difficult. Cool temps and trees are starting to turn color. Lots of day hikers. About 2 miles from the shelter, I tripped and did a face plant. I could tell I had a smashed nose and busted lip but laid there a minute to assess the damage. Besides I was trapped under my pack. When I saw the puddle of blood under my nose, I decided I better get up. It was a real struggle to get turned over and get my arms out of the pack straps. But eventually accomplished that and discovered both of my forearms are scraped up pretty good but otherwise doing good. I stopped my nose bleed and started to clean up but discovered my water bottle has fallen down the hill so had to retrieve it. Time to carry on. Arrived at the shelter about 3:45. A group of hikers from last night are camped here tonight. While fixing dinner, tons more people showed and started setting up camp. This place can accommodate a lot of campers but most seem like a quiet bunch.>>Blackrock Hut (884.4) to Pinefield Hut(897.6) = 13.2 miles>A brief shower last night and cooler this morning so decided to swap my shorts and t-shirt for long pants and long sleeves today. I slept good last night so up at 5:30. There was cell service so read the paper while I drank my coffee. The first mile was uphill to Trayfoot Mountain then mostly easy trails criss crossing Skyland Drive this morning. Most of the day trippers are gone but still quite a few backpackers. The trail skirted the Loft Mountain camp store so stopped in and had a tuna sandwich and potato chips for lunch. I was already getting burned out on PBJ on a whole wheat tortilla. The trail was a little more challenging after lunch but there were several rock outcroppings with views of the valley so I stopped and rested and enjoyed the view at one point. No falls today so made it to camp about 3:45. There are only 6 campsites and all were taken so set up on a not quite level section near some trees. There is a squirrel who I think is intentionally dropping acorns on the two of us camped here. There is a young kid who just got out of the marine who is thru hiking SB. I told him he just skewed the average age of hikers this week which seems to be around mid 60s.>>Pinefield Hut (897.6) to flat spot near South River Picnic Area (912.3) = 14.7 miles>A little warmer today so back to shorts and a T-shirt. Ups and downs are harder too. Although the tree canopy stays about the same, the undergrowth thickens then thins out. Some parts of the trail are almost covered in tal grasses. Met a 70 year old man training for a week long trip down into the Grand Canyon. Then next year a circumnavigation of Mont Blanc.  I hope I have many more hikes in store like him. Made it to Hightop Hut for lunch and water refill at the spring. Several hikers including a grizzled old man with a long white beard also stopped by. The old man had been reading in his chair behind the shelter and came out when he heard voices. He is local and knows all of the trails. Good thing because he nixed my plan for getting water tonight at the picnic area because the taps are turned off. No shelters for camping tonight so I stopped at the creek near the Highway 33 crossing to get water before putting in a few more miles. I came upon a whole slew of hikers who set up camp in a relatively flat area near the picnic area since there are no official camping spots for many more miles. Hope it is more level than last night.>>Mile 912.3 to Big Meadows Campground (Mile 926.6) = 14.3 miles>Slept great. Woke up at 5:00 and read while I had coffee. As soon as it started to get light, I started packing up and was on trail at 7:40. Fairly easy climb to Baldface Mountain then nice trail to Lewis Mountain Campground. Arrived around 10:00. Bought a sausage biscuit and a sandwich for lunch. For $1.00, you can get a 5 minute shower so I took a shower and washed out a pair of socks, underwear and my bandanas in the sink. Headed out feeling refreshed. The trail was a variety of easy with ups and downs and some rocky patches. About 4 or 5 miles later, I tripped over some rocks and did another face plant. I immediately knew this one was worse than a few days ago. My sunglasses were cracked, I had a gash on my forehead and my head was throbbing. I checked Guthooks and it was 0.8 miles to a parking area on the Skyland Drive so headed out. When I got there, I did not have a cell phone signal but was not feeling any worse so decided to keep moving. I had about a mile climb then found a spot at top to rest and eat lunch. My head had stopped hurting so headed on to Big Meadows even though I did not have a reservation for the campground and it said they were full. About 5 minutes from the cut off, I nearly stepped on a rattlesnake which rattled to alert me. After I jumped about 3 feet, I took his picture while he continued to rattle and he coiled back up to scare the next person coming down the trail. I made it to campground around 4:00 and got a campsite and the campground guy called the ranger/medic to come and looks at my head. She thought I should go to Luray to the emergency clinic which I declined since I did not know how I would get there. So she doctored me up with some antibiotic ointment and guaze and I have a pretty impressive black eye now. I asked her to drop me off at the wayside but the grill was closed so I bought a salad, a can of chicken soup and cookie for dinner. This campground is a busy place but quiet hours start at 10:00 and it already is starting to quiet down.>>Big Meadows to Bird Nest #3 Hut (Mile 940.8) = 14.2 miles>Plus 2 miles to and from Wayside>Plus 0.6 miles to spring>>A long but good day. I took my time packing up this morning then walked to the Wayside to get breakfast and enough food supplies to last until Front Royal. That added a couple of miles to my day. The trail between Big Meadows and Skyland is really pretty. The trail up to Hawksbill Mountain switched back and forth from moderate climbs to easy uphills that wind around the mountain and then easy flat trail. Seem like no time at all to make it to the top. It got rocky after that with a couple of rock falls to maneuver but not too bad. When I got to Skyland, there was a detour with big plastic barrier but no directions of where to go. A couple of men in a truck saw me with a perplexed look and told me to go up the hill to the aptly named Stony Mountain Trail. Along the way, I detoured to the lodge to have lunch at the restaurant - hamburger, french fries and blackberry cobbler with ice cream. Then back on the trail for 7 more miles. Lots of rocks and drier terrain but a lot of rock outcroppings with views. I saw the ropes of some climbers but it was too scary to see over the edge to follow them. Lots of day hikers on the trail all day since we are so close to the lodges. The last two miles were a struggle with the rocks and inclines. Finally made it to the shelter a little before 6:00. There are quite a few campers with very few decent campsites. I am beginning to think the park does not really want to encourage hikers on the AT but we have no choice if we stay on the trail. But I finally set my tent up on a thicket of plants since the half way cleared spot was right under a dead limb. I got in my tent and sunk into a low spot. Looks like I am going to have to sleep turned around. I would rather have my feet in the low spot. Then I went to get water and discovered it is a 0.3 mile walk downhill to the spring. At least the spring was flowing really well. By time I got back to my tent, it was starting g to get dark. I am not hungry after that big lunch so at least I don’t have to fix dinner. ","

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631402,"Bird Nest #3 Hut (Mile 940.8) to 211 (Mile 943.8) = 3 miles>When I had climbed enough to get cell service, I called Mountain Home to see if I could get a bunk for Saturday night. I had no idea it was a holiday weekend and they are completely full. She did confirm my package had arrived. I needed to resupply with dinner items so called Open Arms Hostel in Luray. She has room but was out shuttling someone so said to wait at the Panorama picnic area. I had about an hour to wait so checked my emails. Then when Allison arrived, she said we needed to wait for one more hiker. Mike had camped at the same shelter as me but apparently was slow getting going but finally showed up about 15 minutes later. When we got to the house, the usual town stuff - shower, laundry, ride to town for lunch and resupply at the grocery store. Was able to get some work done on the house computer.>>211 to Gravel Springs Hut (Mile 958.1) = 14.3 miles>Dropped Mike and I off at the trail around 8:15. Nice day with lots of ups and downs but nothing real hard. I talked to a hiker and he said he had stayed at the shelter with a guy who thru hiked in the past and had lots of interesting stories. I got to thinking it might be N.Y. guy who has camped at same shelter last several nights and split off from the AT after we left Big Meadows. And sure enough, a little while later, here he comes. He had done a loop over to Old Rag Mountain. Lots of day hikers, backpackers and one trail runner on the trail. Stopped at Elk Wallow Gap wayside for lunch. Lots of people. I saw a line and thought it was the grill line but, no, it was women waiting in line for the bathroom. Made it to the shelter around 5:00. A group of kids had a fire going but were bailing because rain headed our way from the remnants of Hurricane Delta. They left behind some roasted corn on the cob. It was great. It looks like quite a few people are camped here but we are all spread among the trees and hills so that you can’t see them. Found out NY. guy’s trail name is Clean Cut. We talked for awhile then he went to bed. I was sitting by the fire and started talking to another group. One used to live in Austin, another was a pediatric oncology nurse and and another was working on phase 2 clinical trials. Lots in common to talk about. Went to bed around 8:30 so I can get an early start. Rain due in around 8:00 am. May not be able avoid it but would like to get packed up before it starts. I hate packing up a wet or muddy tent.>>Gravel Springs Hut to 522 (Front Royal - Mile 971.5) = 13.4 miles>On the trail by 7:50. Gradual climbs in the morning. Signs of fall with lots of yellow and gold leaves. Stopped a little after 11:00 for lunch on some big rocks. Lots of day hikers on the trail. Around 12:30, it finally started to rain but just a light rain. It was a long gradual downhill to Front Royal. I made it to Mountain House about 3:00 and they had a cancellation in the main house so I am staying for the night. After I showered, Lisa took me into town to get a few more food supplies and to pick up dinner at a Thai restaurant. Still light rain so good to be inside. It is supposed to rain all night and tomorrow morning.>>Front Royal to Whiskey Hollow Shelter (Mile 986.7) = 15.2 miles>Headed out in a light rain at 9:00 am. Fairly easy trails in the morning in a steady rain. A good hiker adage says the good thing about getting your feet wet is you don’t have to worry any longer about getting your feet wet. Saw a few hikers that looked like they were heading home after the long weekend. Made it to to the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter at 11:30. Not really hungry but if I want a dry spot to eat lunch, this is it until the next shelter in 5 more miles. This is a pretty fancy shelter. Good size deck with porch chairs. A separate covered area with a picnic table. Horseshoes. A sign said “shower” but I did not check it out. There was an Ursack, cook pot and water bladder on the picnic table. I figured someone was holed up in their tent back in the woods waiting out the rain. The next 5 miles were more challenging and noisy with train and highway traffic noise. Dropped down and crossed over the train tracks then a little later, the trail crossed under the freeway. As soon as the trail climbed out of the gap, it got quiet again. Made it to the Manassus Shelter around 3:00 and stopped just long enough for a quick snack. Still raining. The last third of the trail was easier but tired of the rain so I decided to listen to my podcasts while hiking. Made it to the shelter about 5:00. I had the place to myself so will sleep in the shelter instead of setting up my tent in the rain. There is a stream just a little ways down from the shelter. While getting water, a young couple showed up. They are SB thru hikers from New Hampshire. Oh well, room to share. They are taking the top level and I get the bottom. There is a covered picnic table so we fixed dinner and hung up our packs and food bags to keep the mice out. Supposed to stop raining by tomorrow morning. Sure hope so.>>Whiskey Hollow Shelter to Sam Moore Shelter (Mile 1002) = 15.3 miles>Up at 5:50 and made coffee. Rain has stopped and stars are out. The other couple said they wanted to get an early start and their alarm went off at 6:00 a but they were still asleep when I left at 7:45. By that time, it had clouded up and was very foggy. The trail looked kind of eerie but very pretty in the fog but then turned into a tunnel cut through heavy brush. Trail was pretty easy and made it 9 miles to the Rod Hollow Shelter by noon. Ate lunch and headed out. I soon hit the roller coaster described as tight ascents and descents. They forgot to mention the rocks. It basically kicked my butt with the steep climbs and the downhills that were steep, rocky and covered in wet leaves so I did not make any better time going downhill than I did going up. I did not get to the shelter until almost 6:00. There were several comments in Guthooks about spiders in the shelter. I could see lots of cobwebs. I can deal with snakes and bears but not spiders. Since I am the only one here, I set my tent up on the front porch of the shelter under the overhang. No rain fly or stakes needed but spider free. Went to get water from the spring next to the shelter and had to fish leaves out which stirred up a bunch of sediment so walked a little ways down the trail to the creek instead. By time I got settled in and made dinner, it was getting dark so ate by the light of my headlamp. After getting settled in my tent, I can hear coyotes nearby. Stars are out and the temperature is dropping. Feels wonderful.>>Sam Moore Shelter to David Lesser Memorial Shelter (Mile 1016.2) = 14.2 miles>Another long, hard day. Headed out at 7:50 to tackle the rest of the roller coaster. Around 10:00, made it to the Bear Den Hostel, which is an old rock house that now serves as a hiker hostel. Except it is closed for groups. You can only camp or get water. And the hiker store is only open from 5:00 - 9:00 pm. So moved on. Had to cross a highway which was nerve racking trying to cross 4 lanes of 18 wheeler traffic. Finally made it to the Rave Rocks which was big rock slabs with great views. I found a isolated spot in the shade and ate lunch and rested a little before I headed out with 8 more miles to go. One last section of the roller coaster then the trail was finally flat for miles but the undergrowth was dead and dried out with lots of dead trees. Not very pretty. It warmed up and I finally had to stop and dig out my short sleeve T-shirt and change clothes. Plus I was out of water. About 3 miles from the shelter, there is a 0.2 mile trail to the Blackburn AT center, downhill of course, where I could get water. They rent cabins but it is closed except for camping. It was nice and cool there and I stayed and talked to Moxie, the caretaker for a while but then time to get back on the trail. Steep uphill climb back to the AT, my punishment for running out of water. Although the last 3 miles were fairly easy trail, I was worn out. Finally arrived. There is a girl who set up her tent on the deck of the shelter. There are several of us camped in the camping area. It is a nice shelter area with a large deck and covered picnic table. Most of the campsites have a bench. But also a lot of dead vegetation that needs to be cleared. The trails this section are maintained by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club and they actually do a great job. And I already have water so I don’t need to take the downhill trail to the spring. Tomorrow only 10 miles to Harpers Ferry, WV. Easy day.","

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631554,"David Lesser Memorial Shelter to Harpers Ferry (Mile 1025.5) = 9.3 miles>Only 10 miles to town but out of water so made the long, steep trek to the spring before heading out. Good thing it was well marked or I would never have found it. The first few miles were flat and easy then some challenging sections then more flat. About 2 and a 1/2 miles from town, started a descent that quickly became steep and gnarly. Met a man who thru hiked and did trail maintenance in the past. He was trying out his new knee replacement for an upcoming trip. Finally saw the Shenandoah River through the trees. Big wide and beautiful. The trail takes you on the very long car bridge over the river. At least the pedestrian walkway has a strong concrete divider between us and the cars. When you get across, the trail cuts over a ridge and takes you to the old town section of the city. After I got there, I discovered my hotel was 2 blocks from where I started up the ridge. Oh well, I had to walk that section at some point. So I walked 1.2 miles to the hotel on city streets. I checked the status of my package I mailed to the hotel with my duffle bag and travel backpack for the flight home. It appears it is lost in transit so I submitted a claim to the post office.I am several days ahead of schedule so the plan is to get shuttled up the trail to the MD/PA line and hike back to Harpers Ferry so I can check Maryland off of the list. After I showered and washed out a few things, I made the 1.2 mile trek back to the city center in search of supplies. I went to the Outfitter and Laura had everything I needed - fuel, batteries and she can shuttle me up the trail tomorrow to extend my hike. Had lunch at an outdoor table at Almost Heaven then 1.2 miles back to the Quality Inn. So much for just a 10 mile day. I need to get the train to DC to catch my flight when I return to Harpers Ferry. If I leave from the hotel on the commuter train that leaves at 6:50 am, I will have to walk in the dark (1.2 miles) to the train station. And my headlamp is fried. So I planned mileage that will get me back to town in time on Sunday to get Amtrak that leaves at 11:30 to get me to DC to catch an afternoon flight. The Ed Garvey Shelter is 6 miles out so as long as I make it there my last night, I should be good.>>Pen-Mar Park (1063.3) to Pine Hut Shelter (Mile 1048.4)>Laura dropped me off about 9:00am. Pretty chilly but I warmed upped after I started walking. Fall colors, cool temps and a pretty easy trail with rocky intervals. No one else on the trail for several miles then ran into several others. There are several of us who are playing leap frog, one group stops to rest and you pass them and then I stopped for lunch and they pass me. I met Sunflower, a young man, at a stream getting water and then we were kind of in sync as we walked. He starting asking me how I was doing, when I stopped to set my pack down, he asked if I was OK. I explained I was just getting my raincoat out because I was cold. Later he wanted to know if I was warm. He was starting to get annoying but the kicker was when several of us stopped at a spring to get water, he started giving me advice on how to get water from the shallow spring. I told him that I had made it over 1000 miles so far and was pretty sure I knew what i was doing. I am sure he means well but he is driving me crazy. By late afternoon, there were a ton of people walking towards me on the trail. There is a parking lot not too far away and it is Friday night so lots of people out for the weekend either hiking or backpacking. Apparently, most of them were headed to Annapolis Rocks to camp but I headed on to the next shelter since I have a timetable to meet. After I got my tent set up and was about to start dinner, Sunflower showed up. Later, after he got set up, he headed to the picnic table at the shelter to fix dinner and asked if I was going to join him. I told him I was cooking dinner from my tent which is what I do when it is cold. Later, I started feeling really achy so took some Advil. As soon as it kicked in, I crashed only to wake up later burning up. I slept fitfully all night and then around 6:00 am, diarrhea kicked in. After that I just got back in my tent and crashed for another two hours. At that point, I knew my plan to check MD off the list was over and I needed to get off the trail because I was extremely miserable and did not know if I had Covid or what the problem was. Fortunately, I had cell service and was only about a half mile from a trail to a parking lot so called for a shuttle driver to pick me up.Update: After a few miserable days, final made it home and to an Urgent Care Clinic. I have giardia and after a couple days of antibiotics, I am seeing an improvement. I have been filtering my water so will need to think about what I can do better next year when I return because I don’t ever want to go through this experience again. ","

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637236,"Day 1: Harpers Ferry to Crampton Gap Shelter (Mile 1036.4) = 11.3 miles
 

Headed out about 9:30. Perfect weather - 50 degrees and sunny. Crossed over the Potomac River and followed the C & O towpath for a few miles. Then the trail climbed for awhile and I stopped at the Ed Garvey Shelter for lunch. Talked to a girl from Baltimore out for a day hike. Easy rolling hills after lunch and even with stopping to talk to a couple of local hikers, made it to Crampton Gap Shelter a little before 4:00. Quite a few people camped here but lots of tenting spots so we are not on top of each other. Sure feels good to be back on the trail but really tired. Fighting to stay awake until it gets dark.
 

Day 2: Crampton Gap Shelter to Pine Knob Shelter (Mile 1048.9) = 12.5 miles

Nice morning, temperatures a little cooler than yesterday, trail alternating between easy and some moderate rocky sections. That Azaleas are starting to bloom. Saw a bunch of turkeys on the trail. Stopped at Rocky Run Shelter for an early lunch. Arrived at the Dahlgren Backpack Campground so stopped to use the restroom and it started a light rain so I stayed for a little while on a bench next to the bathrooms under cover and answered work emails. Checked the weather and good chance for rain later in the afternoon so decided to get moving to beat it before stopping for the day. Did not quite make it so set up my tent in a light rain but not too bad. Crossed over I-70 to get here and can hear the traffic from camp. But warm and dry now so I am good.
 

Day 3: Pine Knob Shelter to Ravens Rock Shelter (Mile 1062.0) = 13.1 miles

Today was a little of everything. It stopped raining the previous evening but started again around 6:00 am. After I had coffee and read for awhile, saw that rain was supposed to stop around 8:00. So started packing up. Went to the bathroom and filtered my water over at the shelter out of the rain. By time I got back to my tent, I was freezing. 38 degrees and now rain sticking round until 9:00 or 10:00. Decided to get back in my sleeping to warm up. Rain finally stopped so headed out about 9:45. The trail was part flat and easy, part moderate hills and one long section of really gnarly rocks. If this is a preview of what to expect in PA then I am not looking forward to it. Talked to Rev who was moving kind of slow because he twisted his ankle on the roller coaster a few days earlier. Later ran into Random and Draker, buddies of Rev, who are all veterans who met on the trail last year. Stopped at Ensign Cowall Shelter for a quick lunch. A young woman was there with her dog trying to warm up. Started to rain lightly so decided to get moving since 5 more miles to go. It would get dark and thunder but never really rain then the sun would come out for 5 minutes. Met a couple who warned me about a creek crossing coming up where the water was fast and high. When I got there, a guy on the other side was trying to figure out the best place to cross so we walked back and forth looking for the best spot and I finally started across on some rocks. I slipped and fell in and dropped my poles but fortunately on the upstream side so made it across with wet feet and just a few scrapes. He decided on a different place to cross and did just fine. Then had to climb a mile long hill to finally make it to the shelter. Put up my tent so it could dry out and then a .3 of a mile downhill trek for water. But sun finally came out and stayed out. Glad to be warm and dry and settled in for the night.
 

Day 4: Ravens Rock Shelter to Tumbling Run Shelter (Mile 1075.2) = 13.2 miles

I was warm enough during the night but by time I broke camp, my hands and feet were really cold. But warm again after 15 or so of walking. Trail pretty easy today but a light rain started mid morning. Arrived at Pen-Mar Park which is for day use only. Nice bathrooms and a covered pavilion but it was deserted except for a few of us hikers. Too cold to stick around so headed out again. Arrived at Deer Luck Shelters (two of them side by side) around 2:00, had a snack and once again too cold to stand still so headed out. Easy trail for the last few miles to Tumbling Run Shelters. Two of them again plus a really nice covered picnic table but I set up and cooked from my tent to stay warm. I would like to socialize more with a few of the other hikers that are on the same schedule as me. A couple of young thru-hikers left us in the dirt. After finishing half of the trail, they are probably doing 20 – 25 miles per day. Heading to town tomorrow to resupply and charge my electronics. I have had good cell phone service most of the week and checking emails and working quite a bit (it sucks, I know!). Charged my iPad and phone with my Anker Power Charger but everything is running low. I read every night for a couple of hours so hate the thought of no power for reading material.  

Day 5: Tumbling Run Shelter to Fayetteville, PA (Mile 1084.8) = 9.6 miles

Rained again some during the night but not quite as cold. Headed out about 8:30 and the trail headed uphill immediately. At the top, I noticed the trees were just starting to leaf out. There was a side trail to Chimney Rocks. I usually skip these side trails because I have enough distance to cover but figured why not, only 10 miles today so no hurry. I dropped my pack towards the top and it was fun to scramble up the rocks without the extra weight. The view was nice, no sign of civilization as far as I could see. The second half of the trail was a series of short climbs over rocky ridges with pine trees growing in addition to the usual broadleaf trees. More rock scrambling but kind of fun. I was going to stop at a Shelter along the way for a quick lunch but it was .3 of a mile downhill so settled for a big rock near the trail. A couple I met from NYC stopped too. Hope to see them somewhere down the trail. A few more easy miles to the highway which goes into Fayetteville. 0.8 mile walk to the Trail of Hope hiker hostel. A very impressive place, part church, part food pantry/part thrift shop with a hiker hostel added in and obviously set up to help a lot of people. Pastor Bob showed me around then drove me to the Dollar General so I could resupply. By time we got back, Chipper and Lizard, two woman I met on the trail had arrived so we are sharing the bunk room. We showered did laundry, and fixed pizza and macaroni and cheese for dinner.
 

Day 6: Fayetteville to Birch Run Shelter (Mile 1094.8) = 10 miles

Up at 6:00 but my companions were sleeping in so I drank coffee and read the paper until 8:00. Another short 10 mile day so no rush. The trail paralleled the road for awhile then cut through Caledonia State Park before climbing again. Most of the trees are just budding out so looks like I have walked far enough north that spring has just arrived. Kind of an average day, average scenery. I did pass a section of pine trees with a few other conifers that was kind of strange. The trees were so thick that it was very dark and very little undergrowth, kind of eery. A little later, back to the usual tree canopy but very thinned out like they had been logging or something. Made it to the Birch Run Shelter and trying to decide if I should stay or push on. But it is a nice area with lots of camping spots and I don’t want to push myself so decided to stay. Red is here but meeting her husband tonight and Lizard and Chipper showed up too along with a couple of other groups. Getting cold again tonight, high 30s or 40 degrees.
 

Day 7: Birch Run Shelter to James Fry Shelter (Mile 1111.9) = 17.1 miles

Chipper and Lizard were still in bed when I headed out a little after 8:00. A little over 6 miles of easy trail to the Tom Run Shelter. Along the way, at Mile 1096.5, hit the AT Midpoint for 2021. Woohoo! Half way! Figured out the sparse forest. They have been doing prescribed burns for forest rehabilitation. Stopped for a short break and a small snack at the shelter but I am saving myself for the grill at Pine Grove Furnace State Park which just opened up this past weekend. Just a few more miles. Talked to some hikers who did 24 miles yesterday but are hurting now. It was a pretty walk into the park. Very pretty large park with camping, pavilions, hiking and best of all a grill. I had a California Burger that was awesome. It is also the location of the Half Gallon Challenge. There is no way I could eat a half gallon of ice cream and if I did, I would be sick afterwards. But I watched Draker, Random and another hiker eat their half gallon. I settled for an ice cream sandwich. Still 7 more miles to go for a total of 17 for the day. I was beat when I reached the James Fry Shelter. Happy to see NYC couple are here and it was warm enough to hang out by the fire and talk instead of getting in my sleeping bag to warm up. Another couple of section hikers I met earlier also showed up.

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637944,"Day 8: James Fry Shelter to Boiling Springs, PA (Mil3 1123.9) = 12 miles

Another cold night so headed out about 8:00 am with cold hands and feet. I intended to walk over to the Green Mountain Store for breakfast when I hit Hwy PA 74 but got confused and missed my turn. Before long it was warm enough to take off my rain jacket. About mid day, I hit a major rock ridge that took some maneuvering over and around giant boulders. At one point, I got out on a ledge that scared me so had to backtrack but eventually made it through. After you pass Boiling Springs, there is no camping allowed for 14 miles as the trail moves through the Cumberland Valley so it was a good place to stop. But the only backpacker campground is right next to the railroad tracks and not recommended. So I called Lisa’s Hostel but she only had tent camping left. That will do. After a hard morning of ups and downs and rocks, the trail finally headed downhill. Then about an hour of skirting farmland exposed to the sun until you get into Boiling Springs. I had an hour and a half before Lisa was coming to pick me up so went to lunch at Caffe 101. Ran into some other hikers and they invited me to join them – No Filter, Snoop Dog and Crinkles. They are also going to Lisa’s. Lisa picked us up at 4:30. She is like a whirlwind and runs a tight ship but it was a nice place. I was able to get a shower at the hostel and hang out around a fire with the others including Pop-tart, Grinder and Cheesehead so sleeping in my tent is no big deal. And I got to use real pillow instead of my little blow up pillow. And I did not have to cook or filter water. Relaxing evening.
 

Day 9: Boiling Springs to Darlington Shelter (Mile 1138.2) = 14.3 miles

Another cold night but slept great. No coffee though. Lisa drove us back to town at 7:25 am on her way to work. Went to Caffe 101 for coffee and a great breakfast. Stopped at the ATC for water because supposedly not much available on the trail. The trail through the Cumberland Valley winds through farmland but fortunately they have maintained a strip of woods for the trail so mostly shady until you get to Carlyle. Then a few miles in open farmland and then the last few miles back into the woods. I passed three young Amish women hiking in their their traditional dresses who were out backpacking for a couple of nights. A mile from the shelter, a sign says to get water at the spring because iffy at the shelter. So carried an extra 2 liters up the steep hill. Nice shelter area with lots of campsites. Good thing because there a ton of people here. Just about everyone I have met along the trail so far is here. I am learning that this section of the hike is a whole different experience than the others so far. With the first of the thru-hikers coming through and a lot of flip floppers starting in Harpers Ferry around May 1, there are lots of people on the trail. This is not going to be as much of a solo experience.  

Day 10: Darlington Shelter to Duncannon, PA (Mile 1149.5) = 11.3 miles

Woke up early and could hear others up and about by 6:00 am which is not normal. When I headed out at 7:10 am, almost everyone was gone. The trail started out easy but turned into rocks about half way. I was on a mission to get to town so did not hardly stop and hit town a little after noon. Staying at the Doyle Hotel. The manager is taking off about 1:30 to go get her Covid vaccine and I wanted to get there and check in before she takes off. The hotel is old and run down but it will do. Took a shower and got a ride to the grocery store to resupply. The I went to dinner at Sorrentos. Ran into some hiker friends so joined them for dinner and wine. The food was very good. Then Birdman, after a few drinks, decided to come join our table and started spouting off that thru hikers are superior to flip floppers. I can only imagine what he thinks of section hikers like me. I decided I was not in the mood to listen to an asshole so paid my bill and went back to the hotel.
 

Day 11: Zero day in Duncannon, PA

Went out around 6:00 am in search of coffee. Nothing close by so walked about 4 or 5 blocks to the Sunoco. Went back to my room and read the paper online then headed over to Goodies for breakfast. Blueberry pancakes with eggs and sausage. Yummy! Crinkles showed up and joined me. After breakfast went back and packed up my food I bought at the grocery store yesterday and sorted out everything in my pack and got ready to go. I am moving to the Red Carpet Inn for my day off so I can get WiFi because I cannot get decent internet access at The Doyle to work.  


Day 12: Duncannon to Peters Mountain Shelter (Mile 1160.5) = 11 miles

Cool and foggy when I headed back to Duncannon. Mailed my package at the post office and back on the trail at 8:45. It was 45 minutes of walking on roads through town then on the shoulder of a busy highway. I could see a wall of trees ahead of me so I knew switchbacks were in my future. When I finally made it back into the woods, it was fairly steep switchbacks, then steep, rocky switchbacks then a long stretch along a rocky ridge. Stopped and had lunch on a big boulder then Derby came by. We played leapfrog all afternoon on fairly easy trails. I finally had my first mishap of this section when I tripped on the rocks. Scraped my knee and side of my face, sprained my index finger, broke my sunglasses and broke one of my hiking poles but nothing too major. I rely on my bifocal sunglasses to read my maps and was able to pop the lens back in and salvage them for that but I don’t think I will be able to wear them while hiking. Derby and I made it to the shelter about 3:30. I set up my tent and headed down the very steep trail to get water since I was out. By time I climbed back up the trail, the rest of his gang had arrived. Eventually others showed up. They are planning more 10 mile days but I would really like to up my mileage over the next few days.
 

Day 13: Peters Mountain Shelter to Rausch Gap Shelter (Mile 1178.4) = 17.9 miles

Up early and headed out at 7:00 am, a record for me. Going to try for the next shelter which is 18 miles. Shorts and t-shirt weather, easy trail, the sound of birds, a nice start. The trail eventually dropped down to Hwy PA325 and Clarks Creek. Derby was already there and I stopped for a snack. It was tempting to just sit and chill by the river but have to keep moving. The trail starts to climb after you cross the river and about a half mile later it got kind of steep. Then I looked up and saw a red blaze. Darn, I am not even on the AT anymore. I backtracked about 10 minutes and apparently I took a quick trip to Jupiter because I don’t see how I could have possibly missed my turn with such well marked signs and blazes. Oh well, carry on. The trail climbed over a couple of miles but was not too steep and eventually leveled off. I stopped along a creek for a late lunch and soaked my feet in the cold water. The trail after that was basically flat and not too bad but I was hurting by time I made it to the turn off to the shelter at 5:00. There are some campsites along a creek right before you turn down the 0.3 mile long trail to the shelter. The campsites are next to the creek and has everything I need including solitude so I am stopping here for the night. The sound of rushing water is so soothing and calming. 
Day 14: Rausch Gap Shelter to William Penn Shelter (Mile 1191.9) = 13.5 miles

A little cool this morning due to the dampness from the creek but once I started moving, it got warm quick. About a mile after leaving camp, the trail was flooded due to a beaver dam. The map warns you have to walk through water but there were enough trees and branches laid out to get through. I had put on clean socks this morning and with my track record when crossing water, I put my dirty socks back on before heading across. My broken pole was sort of working but as soon as I planted it in the beaver pond muck, the sections would separate. So each step, I pushed it back together, it pulled apart, over and over until I got across - with dry feet. Then apparently I was visiting Jupiter again because I missed my turn again. Went a half mile or more before realizing it. When I backtracked, I saw the trees branches that I stepped over that were put there to warn you that you are on the wrong track. Onward. Very warm and after climbing up to a ridge, a bunch of the trees were dead so hiking in the sun. I later learned they are Ash trees killed by a borer. Then the trail traversed a big field before crossing several roads. A man and his dog were waiting for his wife who was thru hiking. He gave me a couple of clementines and topped off my water. Much appreciated. Eventually the trail goes under I-81 and I missed my turn again. That one was not really my fault, just hard to follow because the blazes are up high on the concrete pillars so hard to see but I picked up on it pretty quickly. I wanted to stop for lunch where I could not hear or see the traffic. I had to settle for being out of site of the traffic but still listening to the traffic because I was starting a long climb and needed to rest and refuel. Once I made it up to the ridge, it followed along the ridge for the rest of the afternoon in and out of the sun. Made it to camp about 4:15. I rinsed off a little when I got water but still really warm. Some hikers I met last night came in and gave me duct tape to hopefully hold my pole together until I can see about a replacement. Fewer miles today but still a hard day. The ratio of rocks to dirt is picking up. And it looks like the crowds are more dispersed now so not so many people camping at one spot.","

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637949,"Day 15: William Penn Shelter to Sand Spring (Mile 1210.4) = 18.5 miles
 

Long day ahead so on the trail at 7:00. My duct taped hiking pole is holding up except it does not telescope out so about 3 inches shorter than the right one. First 5 miles were nice and easy. 19 miles to next Shelter so plan to stop every 5 miles. 501 Shelter is near road PA 501 with solar shower and flush toilets but too far off of the trail so I kept on moving. Made it to a really nice camping spot near a stream for lunch at 10 miles. A group of 5 hikers stopped and they were fun to talk to. 4 are relatives and Reroute is a thru hiker who just joined the group, one is long section hiking like me and the rest just out for a week. They came from Oregon, CA and TX. I stocked up on water since it is so warm and headed out. Decided to stop at Sand Spring, about a half mile before the shelter because my feet are killing me. The last half hour just about did me in. The trail was very rocky and the undergrowth was waist to head high so not very pleasant walking. Signs say they are going to do a prescribed burn this summer. It needs it. The last couple of miles of trail were nicer but very few blazes. I need confirmation I am on the right trail. At one point, I was standing there wondering if I was still on the right trail when a southbound hiker I saw yesterday showed up. He assured me I was on right trail. He is doing the trail as out and back day hikes. By time he finishes, he will have done the entire trail twice. The short trail to the spring was so rocky and washed out that I had second thoughts of continuing but found a good place to camp and plenty of water. Short day tomorrow. 9.5 miles to Port Clinton then heading to the Microtel hotel in Hamburg for resupply, shower and laundry. Need to cut it back a little and rest. Hearing lots of complaints about foot problems. So far, I am good after a night’s rest but don’t want to overdue it. I am wearing trail runners instead of sturdier boots or hiking shoes. They were fine last year on much easier trails but I am feeling it more with all of these rocks. My hiking pole is holding up pretty good except now 6 inches shorter than other one. And falling apart at another joint. Maybe I can find some new ones in town.
 

Day 16: Sand Spring to Port Clinton (Mile 1219.9) = 9.5 miles
 

Cooler temperatures last night plus I was so tired, I slept great. Pretty easy day and trail was easy mixed with rocks except the last bit of trail was very steep and scary. Could hear the gang of 5 ahead of me on the trail. They are a noisy bunch but just having fun. When I made it to road, thought I might be able to get an Uber to the hotel but no such luck. Walked the 2 miles along a busy highway. Stopped at Taco Bell next to the hotel and got lunch. Worked all afternoon and washed my clothes by hand and hung them up then headed over to Walmart to resupply. Checked out their hiking poles but they were basically junk so bought a 99 cent roll of duct tape to hopefully keep my current ones going for a little while longer. Saw Reroute at Walmart and she is having feet trouble too. Decided to eat dinner at the pub connected to the hotel but when I got there, the music was so loud, I said never mind and walked across the highway, again, to Red Robin and had a large salad and a chocolate milkshake. Perfect.
 

Day 17: Port Clinton to Mile 1228.2 = 8.3.miles
 

Hanging out until check out time at noon so I can rest up some more. Ran into Pop-tart at breakfast. Last saw her at Boiling Springs. Got some work done and packed up my food supply. Some places have Hiker Boxes so you can leave unused or unwanted items that others might want. I think some hikers buy a box with 6 protein bars but plan their next resupply in 4 days so leave 2 in the box so they don’t have to carry them. I was thinking of doing that but no Hiker Box here at the hotel. Still going to leave my roll of duct behind although I wound some extra on one of my poles. Let’s see. Lunch options before heading out are Wendy’s or Taco Bell again. Texted a shuttle driver last night but he did not respond so looks like I will have to walk the mile and a half to the northbound trail junction. It was 30 minutes on that awful highway with lots of roadkill. When I crossed over the Schuylkill River, I could see some kayakers and a really pretty cliff in the distance. Unfortunately it was covered in graffiti, a very common thing the last couple of weeks. I don’t understand why people think it is OK to deface nature that way. But finally back on the trail. Since i had to climb down into town, I now had to climb back up. The trail was steep but then followed a ridge with ups and downs but nice trail and very pretty. Ran into Pop-tart on the trail. She is headed to the shelter at 6 miles but I feel good and want to do a little more. Just before the shelter, the trail intersects with Reservoir Road and a nearby parking lot so a ton of day hikers were heading to Pulpit Rock. I thought I would do a couple of more miles then look for a place to camp. Best laid plans. It was a steep climb with lots of rocks. After 2.5 miles, it was almost 6:00 and I was getting pretty discouraged because no decent camping spots anywhere but still feeling good so figure I could go another couple of miles. A woman ahead of me paused to look around and I figured she was also looking for a campsite. I checked out the same site she did but took a few steps past a big tree and could see a fire ring someone had made. So someone had camped here before. Once I walked a little further, I saw a decent spot under a tree almost hidden from the trail and decided that would work just fine. Still pretty warm so hope it cools off later. I am laying here in my tent reading a good book, a peaceful, leafy view and bird sounds. I start and end the day with the sounds of birds but different sounds, so different birds I assume. As usual, I don’t recognize most of them although this week I have seen blue jays, robins and a rufous-sided towhee. OK, I recognize the sound of one of the birds, a woodpecker of some sort.
 

Day 18: Mile 1228.2 to Mile 1244.6 = 16.4 miles
 

The first part of the trail was rocky on the way to The Pinnacle. I dropped my pack and walked out to the edge. It was a very nice view. My 99 cent fix is working and my hiking pole is holding up fine. Trail not bad and around 11:00, I made it to a creek and camping spot. Filled up with water and ate lunch. Then a long, hot climb which turned into rocks, all afternoon. I stopped a couple of times to just sit and rest because I was wiped out. When I got to the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter around 4:00, it sounded like a crowd was already there so decided to move on. There is supposed to be a campsite in 2.3 miles. I stopped at the spring near the shelter and collected 3 liters of water and moved on. It was kind of risky because I am not sure how I would have managed 2 more miles of rocks. Fortunately, the trail was fairly easy and I found the campsite and was set up by 6:00. Supposed to be a little bit cooler tomorrow.
 

Day 19: Mile 1244.6 to George Outerbridge Shelter (Mile 1259.1) = 14.4 miles
 

Awesome morning. Easy trail, 60 degrees high for the day. Then met Foxtrot on the trail. I mentioned that I forgot to buy fuel in Hamburg. He gave me his fuel canister since he is stopping in Palmerton and can get a new one. He also took my almost empty one to throw away in town. What a great guy! Then at one of the first road crossings, there was some trail magic – bananas, oatmeal crème pies and sodas in a cooler. I settled for a banana. Then more rocks! I have been hearing about the rocks in PA (aka Rocksylvania) since the beginning of the trail and I am finally experiencing the stuff of legends. Yesterday was bad but today was much worse. Giant piles of rock slabs that you have to walk, climb, and balance on. Sometimes I just sat and slid down. After I finally made it through the first one at a glacial pace, there was some reasonable trail and then another rock pile, and another rock pile. On the fourth rock pile, Wrong Way passed me and offered to carry my poles through a section where I needed my hands to hold on. Finally made it through and stopped and had lunch at Bake Oven Knob Shelter with her and her boyfriend. Then they hurried off to make it to town because he had a job interview via Zoom at 5:00. At least the afternoon rocks were more manageable. Met Hawkeye on the trail and we made it to the George Outerbridge Shelter about an hour later along with Jules, a southbound hiker about 4:30. Found the spring but the shelter is on a rocky hill and we could not find any campsites. Hawkeye has a hammock and Jules is staying in the shelter so I set up my tent on a small grassy area near the shelter that is not very level. Going to have to make do but will probably be rolling down the hill. Per Jules, northbound is more rocks tomorrow.
 

Day 20: George Outerbridge Shelter to Delps Trail campsite (Mile 1270) = 10.9 miles
 

Walked out of camp with Hawkeye as far as the road into Palmerton where he was headed. Started to climb up another rock mountain after that. Yesterday’s was all about balancing on those big rock slabs. Today was hands and feet to climb up the rock slabs. I would toss my poles ahead of me then climb a section and repeat. If you followed the white blazes, it guided you to the best routes. But I eventually hit a spot where I really did not think I could get up because the handholds were so limited and the step up was so high. I studied two separate routes for several minutes and both seemed impossible. I even thought about taking my pack off but realized I would never be able to get it off and lifted up above me. When I eventually went for it, it was not that difficult after all. Once through the rocks, the trail detoured around the Palmerton Zinc Pile Superfind Site. It was an easy walk over Blue Mountain Ridge which was deforested from the zinc smelting but is being remediated. You can see the old smelter and large piles of dirt in the town below. You are warned not to drink the water from the spring on the ridge. The forest is much younger than the surrounding areas so the trail is exposed to the sun more but thankfully not too hot. Then it was miles of just plain old rocky trail. There is no water directly on the trail for 20 miles after the last shelter. Locals often leave jugs of water at road crossings and I was able to top off my bottle a few times in the last few days. When I reached the Delps Trail at 10.9 miles, there was a good camping spot so I decided to stop for the day. I climbed 0.4 miles down a steep, rocky trail to an “unreliable” spring. It was barely running so took me 15 minutes to collect 2 liters of water. I am stopping in Wind Gap tomorrow for a zero day so no reason to go any further today. I thought it was 8 miles from this campsite to town but closer to 11. It does not matter, I am glad to be off of my feet.
 

Day 21: Delps Trail campsite to Wind Gap, PA (Mile 1280.6) = 10.6 miles
 

While packing up this morning, I found a tick on my leg so removed it right away. Does not look like the deer ticks that cause Lyme Disease but will have to monitor it. I need to be more vigilant in using bug repellent. Trail was not too bad the first few miles then a little before half way, miles of rocky trail. At least there were no rock mountains. I passed the Leroy Smith Shelter and was going to stop but the trail to the shelter was downhill so just stopped at the campsites and rested. It has been 10 straight days of hiking and I am really ready for a rest. The final mile was switchbacks that were not too bad and made it to the highway around 12:30. Staying at the Gateway Hotel. It is a small, local hotel. Nothing fancy but close to the trail. I was greeted by Max, a big german shepherd. He even came by my room and scoped it out for me. I guess it passed his inspection because he wandered off after that. I took a shower then walked 20 minutes to the laundromat and put my clothes in the washer, went down to the Café on Broadway to get a sandwich and iced tea, picked up my box at the PO, retrieved my washed clothes and trekked back to the hotel to hang up my clothes. Finally time to get off of my feet. No hiking tomorrow. And then only 16 miles and Pennsylvania is done.","

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638543,"Day 22: Zero day in Wind Gap

Worked all morning then walked to town to get lunch and a few resupply items at the convenience store. Ran into Mona Lisa. The trail skirts towns consistently over the next week so don’t need to carry a bunch of food. I am keeping an eye on the nest of baby birds on top of the fire extinguisher right outside my door. Momma bird tried to distract me and lead me away from them yesterday. They look about ready to head out on their own. Found a pizza place that delivers so no need to walk into town tonight for dinner.
 

Day 23: Wind Gap to Delaware Water Gap (Mile 1296.1) = 15.5 miles

The baby birds were very vocal this morning but they had flown the coop by time I left this morning. One last time to walk to town to get breakfast and mail my package then on the trail a little after 9:00. As expected, a climb out of the gap then more rocky trail. Stopped at Wolf Rocks for lunch. They were rock cliffs that segued into a rock mountain but not too hard or too steep, just slow going. Then more rocky trail until I made it to Kirkridge Shelter at 2:15. Rain in the forecast buy 6.5 miles to Delaware Water Gap. Should I stay or go for it? Seems kind of early to stop and feeling pretty good. 6 more hours of daylight so decided to keep moving. Rain off and on starting about 4:15 then I missed my turn and spent about 45 minutes on the wrong trail. I guess I was being extra careful not to slip on the wet rocks that I was not looking for white blazes. Really started raining by time I got back on the correct trail which was steep, narrow and rocky. When I finally found a place to camp, I was already soaking wet and only 1.6 miles to town so nothing to do but keep on going. Made it to the Church of the Mountain hostel and so glad to get into warm, dry clothes. Only top bunks left so I claimed one of the couches. Skywalker, a woman around my age who I met briefly in Duncannon is here. We visited and ate dinner then Beau who I met in Wind Gap showed up obviously very drunk. He passed out on one of the couches quickly and started snoring. Then the rest of the group of people staying here gradually showed up. Beau woke up and along with a couple of party animals proceeded to play some loud, very bad guitar and be overall obnoxious. It may be a long night.  
Day 24: Delaware Water Gap to Mohican Outdoor Center (Mile 1308.2) = 12.1 miles

Still raining when I finally got up around 6:00 to make my coffee outside on the picnic table. Some people were packing up but then looks like everyone is waiting for the rain to stop before heading out. That is my plan. Besides nothing really opens until about 8:00 so need to wait if I want to get breakfast. One hiker “9 to 5” is working while thru hiking so I am not the only one doing that. Finally walked down to the Village Famer and Bakery for a breakfast sandwich and a large cinnamon roll. Rain was slowing down so headed out about 10:45. Trail left town then crossed the Delaware River by crossing the I-80 bridge. Halfway across was the PA-NJ border. Finished with PA at last! Trail was not too bad at first but eventually turned rocky. No escape from the rocks just yet. Skirted Sunfish Lake. Would be OK on a sunny day but not when it is cold, wet and windy. Started out sloshing through puddles on narrow trail then lots of rocks. Eventually the trail joined a gravel road as it led into the Mohican Outdoor Center, which is campsites and cabins for rent. Everything is booked and the bunkhouse is closed but they let thru hikers camp in the overflow area. We set up camp then went back up to the grill and rec room to hang out by the fire and dry our shoes and socks and gloves. Ordered dinner then more hikers showed up and we hung out until almost 9:00 before back to our tents.  

Day 25: Mohican Outdoor Center to Brink Shelter (Mile 1321) = 12.8 miles

It rained some during the night and those of us camping were all up at 5:00 this morning but I drank coffee and took my time because I wanted to get breakfast before heading out and the grill opens at 8:00. 9 to 5 and his buddies hung out in the rec room all night because they either did not have a tent or warm clothes. Some hikers were convinced summer had arrived and sent extraneous clothes and equipment home. Hiked all day in the cold and rain (what we call winter weather in TX). Stopped only for a quick snack a couple of times because you get too cold if you stop. Hawkeye and I planned to hike to Branchville to eat dinner at Gyp’s Tavern then move a little further down the trail to camp. By time we made it to the shelter at 4:30 with soaking wet shoes and so cold our hands did not work, we knew that was not happening. There were several tents and people in the shelter so looks like quite a few had the same idea. It was lightly raining but by time I got my tent set up and inside, the rain picked up. I had to get in my sleeping bag to warm up before fixing dinner. I did not bring gloves and when I had a chance to pick some up in Duncannon, I figured the worst of the cold weather was done. I tried an experiment of not using a pack cover since I use a plastic trash bag liner to keep my stuff dry in my pack. Big mistake because that means putting a wet pack into my tent which just makes a mess. Rain almost stopped by 8:00 so I ventured out to get water. Supposed to clear up and temps up to 70 degrees tomorrow.
 

Day 26: Brink Shelter to Mashipacong Shelter (Mile 1333.5) = 12.5 miles

Although rain had stopped, still wet, cold and windy so took our time getting going this morning. Hit Branchville about 11:30 so stopped at Gyp’s Tavern for lunch. It is a hiker friendly place right on a lake. Bar was open but kitchen closed because they have food trucks come in on Monday. Hung out for a couple of hours having lunch then back on the trail. Beautiful afternoon with high around 70 although trail still rocky. We saw a fawn curled up right next to the trail. Made it to the shelter a little before 7:00. Nice camping area. Two brothers who camped at Brink Shelter last night are here. I never saw them last night but recognized their tents.
 

Day 27: Mashipacong Shelter to Unionville, NY (Mile 1347.8) = 14.3 miles

Early start. Morning was good but then more rocks but nice weather. PA terrain was kind of monotonous and often dry but NJ has lots of creeks and marshy, boggy areas with boardwalks so a nice change. Walked into Unionville, NY about 3:00. The trail in NJ is near the NY border so we often end up in towns in NY. They allow hikers to camp behind the village office so we set up camp then headed over to Wit’s End Tavern for early dinner - wings, burgers and beer. Later went over to Horler’s General Store for ice cream. Pretty easy day for a change.
 

Day 28: Unionville to Wawayanda Shelter (Mile 1364.6) = 16.8 miles

Stopped at Horler’s General Store for breakfast sandwiches then back on the trail. Easy morning then some challenging sections. Made it to the boardwalks and it started to rain. Pretty good downpour so wet and muddy again. When we made it to Vernon, NJ, we planned to get something to eat at Mitch’s Roadside Grill and stay at the hostel to get a shower. But Mitch’s was not open. We walked over to the Heaven Hill Farm but all they has was produce, bakery stuff and ice cream. I had an ice cream cone although I was hoping for dinner. Rain was forecast for tomorrow morning. A very challenging section was coming up so decided to tackle it today instead of in the rain tomorrow. It is not a good sign when the trail has a name like Stairway to Heaven and it was definitely difficult. Rock steps which turned into rock jumbles. Finally made it to the shelter at 7:15. By time I set up camp, fixed dinner and cleaned up, it was dark. Long day.
 

Day 29: Wawayanda Shelter to Wildcat Shelter (Mile 1376.8) = 12.2 miles

Hawkeye headed out early since he wanted to hitch into Warwick to resupply. It was 15% chance of rain when I headed out at 7:30 and by 8:30 it was pouring rain. I found some big trees to get under which blocked some of the rain but finally had to put on my rain coat. When it slacked off some, I got going again. Mosquitoes are bad in the low spots and near the creeks so when rain stopped and I climbed up to some higher rocks around 10:00, I stopped for lunch even though it was early because I was starving. Just as I finished up, Hawkeye caught up so we headed out. Guthooks repeatedly showed “rocky outcrop” as waypoints on the map and it was not kidding. Just one after another of huge rocks to walk and climb over. Wet rocks that were very slippery. We both slipped and fell more than once. Hawkeye got pretty banged up and broke one of his poles. So we resorted to sliding down on our butts in some spots. We stopped to rest and a couple of guys we met previously came by. One of them has multiple single poles in his truck from breaking the other one of the pair so he gave one of his poles to Hawkeye since he only had a couple more miles to go for the day. When we got to Peters Mountain, we headed over to the Hot Dog Stand but just like yesterday, it was closed. So we crossed the road to the Bellvale Creamery and got ice cream sundaes instead. It is a hiker friendly place with a charging station and a water spigot. Plus great ice cream with a bench to sit and watch the view. A couple of guys we met in the parking lot gave me a ride to the deli at the bottom of the hill and back up to get a sandwich while Hawkeye stayed with the packs. Then back on the trail for more rocks. At some point, passed the NJ/NY state line. Another state checked off. It was starting to rain a little so when a bypass trail around the last group of rocks was available, I decided I had enough and took the easy route so I could get done and make it to the shelter in one piece. This is a very nice shelter area. Lots of camping spots, a nice shelter, a bear box, and water close by. Met a through hiker doing 20 – 25 miles a day because he is ready to go home and just trying to get done. And another hiker I have been seeing off and on the last several days getting off the trail due to a leg injury. Got set up and ate my sandwich and now light rain falling.
 

Day 30: Wildcat Shelter Highway NY 17 (Mile 1386.7) = 9.9 miles

Last day on the trail for this go round. Lots of ups and downs and varied rocks, pretty slow going. Rocks in the sun are dry but still wet when you get in the trees. And lots of mosquitos with the rain and warmer weather. A couple of miles before I was getting off trail, Hawkeye decided to push on since he had 7 more miles to the next shelter and rain on its way. I wished him luck. The last section is called the Angry Grind. It was really tough. Scary tough. At one point, it just looked like a big chute full of rocks that I had to get down. Kind of wondering what I was doing there but I made it through OK. I could have continued on one more day since my flight is not until Sunday but NY 17 seemed like a better option to get to the train station if I have trouble getting a taxi or Uber. Worst case scenario, I could walk if necessary.  

When I made it to the road, there was an older gentleman with trail magic. Quarts of ice cold Gatorade and homemade sweets - banana bread, applesauce spice cake and brownies. I had both applesauce spice cake and a brownie. He says he has been there every day except two since April. I told him I was headed to the Tuxedo Motel about 2 miles down the road. He was about to shut it down since almost 3:00 and rain on its way so he gave me a ride. Great finish to a difficult day. Time to give my feet, ankles and knees a rest. And first shower in a week so I am presentable to get on the train tomorrow. Metro North to Secaucus then taxi or Uber to hotel so I can make my flight home on Sunday. Total of 360.7 miles in a month and I would consider this the hardest section so far but I plan to be back to carry on.","

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644457,"Day 1 VT 9 to power lines (Mile 1613.9 to 1604.4 = 9.5 miles)
 

My initial plan was to fly into Newark and take the train to Harriman to get back on the trail at NY17 where I got off in June. I was not looking forward to hitting Bear Mountain on a holiday weekend but I had to fit this into the time that worked. Apparently Bear Mountain is very popular on the weekend with people from NYC. Then one thing after another seemed to stack the cards against me.
 

I discovered the early morning train to Harriman does not run on weekends so I would get a late start. Then they closed a shelter a few miles in from NY17 due to excess bear activity. Then wells along that stretch were “closed due to contamination. Not sure if that would affect me since I always get water from streams or springs. But the clincher was about 0.4 miles after I got on the trail, the bridge over Hwy 87 was closed because of unsafe conditions and required an 8.5 mile detour. So I decided to change my plans and start in Vermont and head south back to NY. Maybe by time I get to NY, all of these issues will be resolved. Then the week before heading out, Hurricane Ida came through. Although Vermont got rain too, it looked like NY was worse. So here I am outside Bennington, VT heading south.
 

I knew my plan to make it 11.5 miles to the Seth Warner Shelter was overly ambitious for my first day but I figured I could make it. The trail had other plans. I knew there was a steep climb from the road and my shuttle driver referred to it as stairs. That implies some sort of even, consistent steps but it was more like rocks with a few steps mixed in. I met a guy about my age right off the bat who was 2.5 days into his hike on the Long Trail (which follows the AT along this section) and he was getting off because he was not enjoying himself due to the ups and downs and the mud. The ups and downs are just part of experience and I knew there would be mud with all the rain. Turns out the ups and downs were not out of the ordinary but he was right on about the mud. Stopped at Cogdon shelter for lunch. It was damp and dreary so did not stay long. I did read the trail register to see if anyone I hiked with back in May had made it this far. AT Positive and Ballpark are the only ones I recognized. I tried to avoid the mud as much as possible by walking on the edges of the trail but sometimes you could not avoid it or slipped on a rock and ended up in it anyway. Nothing like being up to your ankles in mud. Or having the mud suck your shoes off your feet. Then it started raining about 2:00. Between the wet rocks, roots, mud and sections of trail that are under water, I was making really lousy time. When I made it to the beaver pond, I met a guy who had stopped to camp in a flat area. There was room for one more tent and I considered stopping but decided to push on. I was still 2 miles from the shelter when I hit the power lines at 5:00. The rain had stopped and there was a flat grassy area right next to the trail and I decided it was a good place to stop. The area is surrounded by a sea of ferns, goldenrod and asters with a nice breeze and socked in with fog. Feeling cozy. A young guy hiked by about 7:00 pm. It is now raining again so looks like he will be hiking in the dark and the rain.
 
 
 

Power lines to Wilbur Clearing Shelter (Mile 1604 to 1592.5 = 11.5 miles)
 

Woke up to rain around midnight. Then the wind picked up. There was only a shallow layer of soil over the rock so I did not get my rainfly staked down as well as I would have liked. So it was flapping in the wind which was very annoying but eventually I went back to sleep. A young woman and her dog coming from the shelter walked by while I was packing up this morning. The sun started to break through and i could see the hills but it was socked in again by time I left. I passed a bunch of more hikers that had stayed at the shelter. Plus I learned it was a very muddy 0.2 mile trail to the shelter. Glad I camped where I did.
 

The trail was still really muddy the first couple of hours but got better. Normal mud instead of soul sucking mud. At some point, I left VT and moved into Mass. Almost immediately, the foliage cleared out some and I realized the section through VT was really oppressive with thick foliage and tree canopy that pressed in all around you. Half way to tonight’s shelter, the sun came out and I found a big rock to sit on while I ate lunch. After I ate lunch, the trail headed downhill. Then there was a sign for a Bad Weather Bypass Trail. That means something bad is ahead. Turned out to be a giant rock pile that I had navigate down. Glad it was dry and sunny. The trail then drops down into North Adams, MA so I walked through a residential area until the trail heads back into the woods. Then a 2.5 mile killer climb up to Mount Prospect. Due to work obligations and the Texas heat, I did not do as much training as I should have for this section. I hope I get my trail legs soon. The climbs don’t get easy but they do get easier. Then the trail immediately headed back down hill to the cutoff to the shelter. It is a nice shelter with lots of tent sites and the intermittent stream is flowing very well. And I have it all to myself. Looks like all of the weekend hikers have gone home and I left the Long Trail hikers behind in VT. After I got water, I put on my camp shoes to walk back to the stream so I could wash some of the mud off of me and my shoes. Walking in these cheap plastic shoes is less than ideal and I tripped over a branch or something and fell. Just a few minor scrapes and bruises.
 

Wilbur Clearing Shelter to Cheshire, MA (Mile1592.5 to 1580.9 = 14.6 miles)
 

Awesome morning. Cool temps, easy trail mixed with some uphills. No one else on the trail. The trail got really steep the last 1/2 mile or so up to Mount Greylock, highest spot in MA. Nice views and a war memorial on top. I had hoped to stay in the bunk room at Bascom Lodge or get a meal at the restaurant. But the lodge is closed on Monday and Tuesday and apparently the restaurant is not open at all. At least there was picnic table with a nice view so I stopped and rested and ate a snack. Then a steep downhill. Stopped for lunch and the trail was better after that. Got into Cheshire about 4:30 and headed to Father Tom’s campground. Fortunately I ran into two women hikers who told me I was going the wrong way. I was looking forward to dinner at the seafood restaurant but of course, it was closed on Tuesday. So stopped at Dottie’s Twist across the street and bought a sandwich. The campground was great. A grassy lot for tents with water, a port a potty, bicycles to borrow and a bank of charging stations. There were 4 other section hikers and one thru hiker camped there so hung out and visited. Father Tom was an avid hiker and AT thru hiker who hosted hikers at the church. After he died a few years ago, the church decided they could not continue the tradition so the local hiking club worked with the city to create this nice campground.
 

Cheshire to Dalton (Mile 1580.9 to 1572.2 = 8.7 miles)
 

Overall, easiest day this week. No one on trail until mid day. Made it to Dalton by 1:30. Stopped at the library to use their computer and the nice lady working there helped me download and print the bus schedule. I checked my work email and worked until I was kicked oit since they only had one computer and someone else needed it. Caught the bus for a $1.00 to my hotel. It was 2 miles on a busy road so did not want to walk. Not impressed with the Econo Lodge. Laundry facilities but no soap, no breakfast as promised, less than stellar customer service. So I washed everything by hand and hung it up in the bathroom. Then walked to the grocery store to resupply and ate dinner at Applebee’s.
 

Dalton to October Mountain Shelter (Mile 1572.2 to 1560.4 = 11.8 miles)
 

Put on still damp clothes and walked over to McDonald’s for breakfast. Got the bus back to town and walked about a mile before getting back into the woods. It rained last tonight so back to the mud and pools of water. Climbed out of town for a few miles but then pretty easy trail. Light rain that cleared up by late morning. No one on the trail until mid day. I stopped on Warner Hill for lunch and sat on a rocky outcrop which was nicer then stopping in the damp, dark woods. The highlight of my afternoon was seeing a beautiful owl. She watched me the entire time I moved around the tree trying to find the best spot to take a picture but did not fly off. I looked it up later and think it was a Barred Owl.
 

Made it to the shelter a little before 5:00 and pretty tired. Pretty nice shelter area. Letterman, a NOBO thru hiker showed up shortly after I did. I said aren’t you a little late? since it is probably too late to make it to Katahdin before the park closes. He said yes because he had to get off the trail for a month due to an injury but is getting off in Dalton to work out the logistics of getting up to Baxter State Park to summit Katahdin then head SOBO to finish. Then a couple I met on the road in North Adams a few days back showed up. Letterman said he planned and researched gear for 10 years and watched about a 1000 you tube videos to prepare for this hike. I prepared in about 4 months and probably watched around 15 videos. Seems to be working reasonable well.
 

October Mountain Shelter to Goose Pond Road (Mile 1560.4 to 1548.9 = 11.5 miles)
 

Rain is gone but overcast. Trail more of the same - roots, rocks, mud and an occasional rock jumble. Stopped mid day on Becket Mountain to eat lunch. There is the foundation of an old fire tower there. Can’t imagine anything burning around here as wet as it is. Trail better in the afternoon with long section of dry trail mixed with sloppy stuff. Crossed 3 roads including the Mass Turnpike but very few people on the trail. Then it happened so quickly, I stepped on a cross piece of the boardwalk just like a 100 time that day and slipped and went flying. Wet and muddy with a few scrapes and bruises but nothing too major. MA makes a big deal of only camping in designated places but then there are big gaps of places to camp. It was only 8/9 miles to Goose Pond Cabin which is closed but you can camp there but it was too early to stop. So I moved on and found a flat spot to camp in the trees just before Goose Pond Road. Stealth camping will have to do because it is 7.5 miles to the next shelter. Got set up and discovered I have a crisis. My iPad has gone wonky and says I have no books downloaded and nothing in my Kindle library. Unless Amazon has shut down that is crazy. But no cell phone service so I cannot sync my account. I panicked at the thought of nothing to read. Oh well, I can work on my trail journal. Good news, I found a book downloaded on my iPhone. Less than ideal but something to read. It is 7:00 pm and no way I can go to sleep yet.
 

Goose Pond Road to Mt Wilcox South Shelter (Mile 1548.9 to 1535.6 = 13.3 miles)
 

Overall, not a bad day. Around 48-50 degrees starting out but quickly warmed up on the climbs. A little of everything - some rock jumbles in the morning, a lot of small and medium ups and downs, some mud, some easy trail. Late afternoon I finally had a cell phone signal so got my books downloaded again. Decided not to get water even though I was completely out since map showed 2 water sources at the shelter. The spring was close but it was a dud. I could barely reach the water level down between the rocks and as soon as you tried to scoop it up, you stirred up a lot of sediment. So walked a ways down the trail to a stream that was running good. While down there, Blue Valley and Mary that I camped with in Cheshire showed up. They had just seen a really big bear on the trail a few minutes before. Long day and I am really tired so I did not worry about bears for long.
 

Mt Wilcox South Shelter to Great Barrington, MA (Mile 1535.6 to 1523.9 = 11.7 miles)
 

Mix of easy and some steep up and dows but not too long. Hit the Ledges with a view.
Had lunch near Tom Leanard Shelter on rocky outcrop overlooking the shelter. As you get close to town, the trail runs through some pastures then alongside cornfields. You come out on a road and cross the river on a bridge. I called Joe, my shuttle driver to tell him I was almost to the pick up spot and not paying attention so missed the white blazes telling me turn. When I realized what I did I walked back and some guys on bicycles told me where to go which just confused me more and I had no idea where I was supposed to go. I finally called Joe back and came and picked me up at the bridge. Heading to the Days Inn for a zero. Joe gave me and another couple of hikers a ride to the laundromat so I washed my clothes, picked up pizza and wine at the grocery store and walked the mile back to the hotel. Rest day tomorrow.","

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644551,"Great Barrington to Laurel Ridge Campsite (Mile 1523.9 to 1510.8 = 13.1 miles)
 

While I was taking my day off, I checked the mileage I had left to see how I was doing. Apparently, I miscalculated when I made my plans because I will have to average 14 miles per day with no more days off to get back to NY17 in time to make my scheduled flight home. That is not going to happen unless I just really push myself. That would not be fun and is not likely to happen. Oh well, I will just keep going and see what happens.  

Did not get started until a little after 9:00 since Joe had another shuttle before ours. I could have walked the 3 miles but decided there was no point in that so I waited for my ride. When I got to my trail, I had to walk across a field and met a woman with long pants, long sleeves and bug net over her head with mosquitoes swarming all around. I am in shorts and short sleeves but no problem. I have been using Picaridin which repels ticks since this is prime lyme disease country. Checked the label and it also works for mosquitoes. I am impressed. I also treated my clothes before I came with Permethrin for ticks too.
 

First 4 miles easiest of trip but lots of mosquitoes in boggy areas. Met a woman out walking with her dogs. She does trail maintenance and said the boggy area coming up was under 4 feet of water in July. A little later I received some trail magic from a woman waiting for husband who was slack packing. Strawberry lemonade tasted awesome. I passed on the Girl Scout cookies since I just resupplied with food and did not want any more weight in my pack. The next part was a fun section, hard enough to be challenging but not so hard you have to stop and rest to catch your breath, you climb up to a ridge, there are rock slabs but lots of trees, very pretty. I stopped for lunch on a rocky outcrop and met a trail maintenance guy. He said they were getting ready to redo the white blazes through that area which is needed among all of the rocks. Then a steep climb up Mt Everett and steep down on rock slabs. Another one of those where I sure am glad it was not raining. Then over Mt Race and ledges with awesome views, mostly trees with a few small clearings. Then more rocky trail. I am really tired of rocks. I stopped for water 0.2 miles from campsite since I wanted to be sure I had water when I arrived and did not want to walk any more steps than necessary. It is a nice campsite and I am the only one here.
 

Laurel Ridge Campsite to Limestone Spring Shelter (Mile 1510.8 to 1498.5 = 12.3 miles)
 

Early start. Easy trail for a few miles then a blip on the map, showing a steep incline but not real long. Little did I know. It was one of those mountains of rock slabs that require more climbing then walking. And it was so humid, the rocks were sweating. Just what I needed, slippery rocks. At one point, I took off my pack and pushed it up over the rocks so I could climb easier. Still could not do it so backed down and tried a different route. Finally retrieved my pack and poles and carried on. Repeat. Going down on the other side was not as bad but still hard and very slow. At least I was done with the worst of the trail by 10:00 am. Found a nice, rocky outcrop with a view that was mosquito free so stopped for early lunch. Nothing but mountains and trees as far as you can see. I needed to stop in Salisbury, CT to pick up a package at the post office. The PO is closed from 1:00 - 2:00 so of course I arrived at 1:30. I grabbed a snack and soda from the market and hung out in the hikers square - shady picnic tables, electrical outlets and trash cans. Once I retrieved my package with some food items, I packed my food bag and threw out the items I bought a few days before that I really didn’t like such as the peanut butter crackers. It is a nice little town and I thought about spending the night since rain is forecast. But no hotel, just a couple of people who rent rooms. Decided to move on to try and beat the rain. It is really warm today, low 80s, plus very humid. I stopped for water when I got close to the cut off to the shelter and poured water over my head to rinse my hair. If VT and MA were all about the mud then CT is definitely all about the mosquitoes. The shelter is a half mile off the trail, and a really steep trail at times. I figured no one would be here. But there were two guys already there with their tents set up in the shelter to get away from the mosquitos and two other hikers showed up right before dark. Chance of rain has decreased but I set up my tent on one of the wooden platforms so at least my tent won’t be muddy if it does rain.
 

Limestone Spring Shelter to Cesar Brook Campsite (Mile 1498.5 to 1483.9 = 14.6 miles)
 

Light rain last night then woke up about 2:00 am to heavy rain. As usual, my tent leaks from the bottom when there is heavy rain. Packed up a wet tent and gear and headed out. Easy trail first half of the day. Detoured about a quarter mile to Falls Village, CT for a late breakfast at Falls Village Cafe. Very good. Then back on the trail. Warm this afternoon and quite a bit of road walking then the tree canopy was kind of sparse so lack of shade made it even warmer. Seems like anytime I start sweating a lot, I really start dragging. I hear people talk about using electrolytes in their water so I think I will try them next time. Lots of ups and downs until I reached Pine Swamp Brook Shelter a little before 4:00. Decided to move on and do a few more miles although it is always a crap shoot with the trail. The map showed some hills but there were also boulder fields and a large crevice I had to climb down. Map does not show that. Finally made it to camp a little after 6:00. My legs are shot.  

Cesar Brook Campsite to Mt Argo Shelter (Mile 1483.9 to 1469.9 = 14 miles)
 

Early start since I want to make it to Kent, CT for a shower and food resupply. Felt cool when I started out but started sweating as soon as the trail climbed. I was thinking that the streams are all running really well here in CT. Then I hit a stream just before CT 4 that was running a little too well. It was so high that I was concerned about getting across. The young couple I had camped with the last couple of nights had already crossed but they waited for me. Tim yelled and motioned that I needed to take off my shoes and socks to ford it. The water was not real cold but I was still pretty nervous once I started across. Tim coaxed me across and steered me to the shallow sections. It’s not likely I would have been swept away but the water was moving really fast and it definitely would have involved wet gear and bruises if I fell. I was relieved when I finally got across. I learned something too. I was focusing on crossing the section where there were some rocks I could walk on but then I had to step off into deep, swift running water. I needed to focus on crossing in the calm, shallow water since I am already in the water so who cares if there are no rocks to step on. Later, I discovered there was a high water detour noted on the map if it really was too dangerous to cross. After a couple of hours, the trail runs adjacent to the Housatonic River and is a flat easy trail for miles. Very nice. But then there are “stairs” climbing up from the river. Stairs if you are 8 feet tall but climbing if you are short like me. Then more ups and downs. When I finally made it to the road that goes into Kent, it was after 5:30 so I made the steep climb up to the shelter instead so I could get set up and fix dinner before dark. I will leave my pack up here and climb down and walk into town in the morning. It is really warm so may be hard to sleep tonight.
 

Mt Argo Shelter to Ten Mile River Shelter (Mile 1469.9 to 1461.5 = 8.4 miles)
 

Packed up most of my gear and put it in my tent then headed to Kent. Stopped at the Bakery for breakfast. Then over to the Welcome Center where they have a coin operated shower - $2.00 for a 4 minute hot shower. They also have electrical outlets to charge your electronics. Then over to the grocery store to stock up. By the time I walked back (and up the steep hill) to the shelter and finished packing up, I did not leave camp until 11:00. Lots of ups and down and very warm, bugs are bad, morale is bad. The last few miles before Shelter were downhill then detoured to Bullis Bridge Country Store via one of the remaining covered bridges in CT. Gatorade and an ice cream bar. Now my morale has improved. Then just 1.2 miles to shelter. Visited with a guy from Manhattan out for the weekend fishing and camping out.
 

Ten Mile River Shelter to Telephone Pioneers Shelter (Mile 1461.5 to 1448.7 = 12.8 miles)
 

Today was a good day. I turned the wrong way as soon as I came off the trail to the shelter back onto the AT. I figured it out within 5 minutes and got to see a great blue heron down by the river so not all bad. Cooler temps today, some hills in the early part, then an early lunch at Wiley Shelter with Manhattan. A little after we left there, I looked up and saw some turkeys crossing the trail. I counted 15 turkeys walking single file across the trail, about half adults and half this year’s new chicks about half grown, then each walked up a dead tree laying along the trail, looked around then jumped down, one turkey taking up the rear, I guess as a sentry because he was definitely keeping an eye on me. The trail winds in and out of CT and NY during this stretch. CT had much nicer privies and bear boxes at each campsite plus better blazes and signage on the trail. Easy trail in afternoon, then pastures and boardwalks although got off course in the nature preserve without many blazes. I later met a woman who said she got lost at the same spot. When I hit the road at NY 22, I was thinking of walking a half mile down to Toni’s Deli but decided I should move on. I settled on stopping at the Garden Center for a Gatorade. Crossed the train tracks at the official Appalachian Trail Station to take the train to NYC. Actually, just a platform with a sign. Still three more miles to go. There was a steep climb the last half mile to shelter but it was a nice setting, surrounded by rock like an amphitheater. There were no level spots so I set up in the best spot I could find. There was a dead tree with a big branch about 40 – 50 feet away but I figured it would be OK. There was a full moon and I had the place to myself. Then in the middle of the night, I woke to loud cracking and heard a tree come crashing down. Very scary. The next day I could see it was that dead tree and it had snapped right in the middle and the top half of the tree crashed down. Maybe I better set up a little farther away next time I see a dead tree nearby.
 

Telephone Pioneers Shelter to Hwy 52 (Mile 1448.7 to 1437 = 11.7 miles)   

When I made coffee this morning, I used twigs to level my stove since the ground was so sloped. Still managed to spill my boiling water and had to start all over using a fairly flat rock the second time to support my stove. An easy morning then the trail skirted around Nuclear Lake. No houses, no boat docks, no boats. I researched it later and learned there was research with plutonium done here and some type of explosion so the research facility lost its permit. Glad I just kept on moving through the area. Rocks and mosquitoes were on the menu for mid day but I did find a sunny rock without mosquitoes to eat lunch. I could see a couple of trees with leaves that had turned red but very little signs of fall yet. Just a few trees starting to turn yellow. Made it to NY 52 and walked the half mile from the trail to Mountain Top Deli and Market where I heard you could camp. I got there around 3:00 and sure enough the owner has a grassy field behind his business and is fine with you camping there. There is water and an electrical outlet so I took it easy and rested, having pizza, beer and ice cream for dinner.
 

Hwy 52 to Clarence Fahnestock State Park (Mile 1437 to 1426.9 = 10.1 miles)
 

Heavy dew this morning so packed up a wet tent. A breakfast sandwich and a pastrami sandwich to go for dinner and I was ready to go. Another easy day. Stopped at RPH Shelter for an early lunch. One of the trail volunteers who looks kind of like Sam Elliot was doing some maintenance on the Shelter there and we talked for awhile. Then I headed out. The trail was noisy with traffic from nearby highways. Made it to the State Park and then started following a half mile side trail to the campsite. It was extremely loud with highway traffic and shooting from a nearby gun range. The trail was really steep and rocky so I turned back. There was not much information about camping here in either AWOL or Guthooks. I followed the AT and then found a different trail that leads to a beach next to the lake and you follow a gravel road to the camping area. There is a brand new shelter just finished a few days ago but I set up my tent so it could dry out. Visited with a 21 y.o. young man until the mosquitoes drove us to our tents. He was a small person and carrying a 45 pound pack with stuff like a fold up chair and a huge fuel cannister like you use for car camping. He was frustrated that he could not seem to go more than 10 miles per day. He will learn.  

CFSP to Graymoor Spiritual Living Center  (1426.9 to 1413.1 = 13.8 miles)  

I had left the vestibule open on my tent to get some air circulation since it was so warm. I woke to rain so closed it. I did not stake out my rain fly since only 25% chance of rain. Woke to heavy rain and water seeping into my tent getting everything wet. At 3:00 am, got up and moved tent and all my gear into the shelter since no one there and managed to get another couple of hours of sleep. My tent had mostly dried by time I packed up but my sleeping bag and sleeping bag liner were wet.
 

The trail was harder today, mostly rock. Plus the rocks and roots were wet and slippery so slow going. Mosquitoes are the worst yet. To eat lunch, I put on my rain coat with the hood up to keep them off as much as possible but did not stay long. Warm and muggy. Maybe I sweated all my insect repellent off because it is not working today. After lunch, I stopped at a stream and rinsed my hair out. Maybe with the sweat rinsed off, my head will not be so attractive to the bugs. Finally made it to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center run by Franciscan Friars where they let you camp at the baseball field. While walking down the road, I was looking around and caught the edge of the pavement and fell. Now my left wrist and knee are sore. I managed to limp into the camping area and get set up. There are electrical outlets to charge stuff and there is also an outdoor shower. A little too cold to get all the way in but still managed to get cleaned up pretty good. Fixed dinner and even though I had on long pants and long sleeves, the mosquitoes were driving me crazy so I ate in my tent. Rain due in later tonight.
 

Graymoor Spiritual Living Center to US 9/NY 403 (Mile 1413.1 to 1412.5 = 0.6 miles)
 

Last day on the trail. Dodged a bullet since it was not raining yet and I don’t have to pack up wet gear before flying home. Packed up and headed out by 7:00 am. Feeling good thanks to ibuprofen. Warm, muggy and mosquitos out in full force. After a little more than half a mile, the trail crosses US 9/NY 403 into Peekskill. Stopped at the Appalachian deli for a breakfast sandwich. Met a couple who are yo-yoing, completed their NOBO thru hike so now returning and doing another thru hike SOBO. I was planning to go 6 miles and cross the Hudson River to Bear Mountain State Park and get a taxi to the Harriman train station. Looked like I should make it before the rain arrives but this is a major storm ahead of the first cold front of the year. Since I am already short about 20 miles of my goal and will have to swing by NY later to complete those miles at some point, decided to bail here and make it 26 miles left in NY. Got an Uber to the train station in Peekskill which will take me into Grand Central Station where I can a bus over to Newark.  
I have to say this was my least favorite section of the trail so far. The mud and mosquitos and warmer than normal temperatures were really demoralizing. Just bad timing I guess since they had record amounts of rainfall this year. Too bad they can’t send it to the west coast. Until next year.","
","Week 2+: Great Barrington, MA to NY","Sep 25, Sat",0
Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656643,"Picked up my rental car in Albany, NY and drove south to hike a section I missed last fall. I drove around last night to scope out options for parking and getting a ride to my starting point. My first choice for parking on the road into Bear Mountain Park was nixed because I could not get cell service. So I checked out Pallisades Parkway. This is where they rerouted where the trail crosses the road because people keep getting killed by motorists when crossing the road. I get it because speed limit is 55, I was driving 60 while searching for a spot to turn around and go north and I was about run off the road by people going 70+ and weaving in and out of traffic.
Headed over to park off Palisades Parkway on Thursday morning and scheduled Uber to give me a ride over to the Appalachian Market, where I got off the trail last fall. Daryl in his Cadillac gave me a ride. I bought a breakfast sandwich at the market and talked to some guys who bicycled up from the Bronx. Brave souls from what I see about drivers around here.
Trail was nice first thing but I got dizzy and nauseated on the first climb so knew it was going to be a long, hot hike. Some people embrace the heat or at least tolerate it but even with training in the Texas heat the last few months, I am no better prepared for these hot days. Crossed the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge after a few hours then lost the trail like I always seem to do when I walk on roads. Finally saw a sign for Bear Mountain Park so headed that way. I missed the trail side zoo that I should have passed but no big loss from what I hear.
I was able to buy a cold Powerade at the snack bar near Bear Mountain Inn which was good since I was too hot to eat. The climb up Bear Mountain was on lots of stone steps from the CCC era. There is a parking lot at top for those who drive up to the Perkins Memorial Tower and vending machines so able to stock up on water for the final stretch. I was really dragging by time I made it back to my car around 4:30. I thought it was 12 miles but checking the map again, it shows 14 miles for the stretch I just completed. But mission accomplished and now onward to Vermont to start my last section.

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656645,"Day 1 VT9, Bennington to Goddard Shelter - Mile 1613.9 to 1624 = 10.1 miles
Got a ride to the trail on the first shuttle out at 8:15. On the trail by 8:40. Immediately crossed a stream on a footbridge so good to know the heat has not dried up the water sources. A long climb for about 2.5 miles. Not as warm as N.Y. but more humid so totally drenched within a few minutes. The trail is wet with a few mud holes but nothing like the ankle deep mud I had when hiking this area last fall. I stopped at an overlook around 12:30 and ate lunch and rested and cooled off for about an hour. Met Kronos, a hiker from New Braunfels near where I live. The afternoon was not too bad until the climb up to the shelter. A great water source so quite a few hikers were stocking up and moving on a little further up the hill to the lookout tower on Glastonbury Mountain to watch the sunset and camp. But I am beat so set up my tent and rested a while before fixing dinner and visiting with some other hikers staying in the shelter. It’s sprinkling rain off and on so decided to get in bed and read in case big rains come in.
Day 2 Goddard Shelter to IP Logging Road - Mile 1624 to 1638 = 14 miles
Temperatures cooled down and I went to bed at 8:30 and slept great. Woke up at 5:30, made coffee and started packing up. I have a morning routine but with a new pack, I seemed off and it seemed to take forever to get packed up. But still hit the trail a little after 7:00. It was not any lighter than when I got up at 5:30. Made the short climb to the tower but it was socked in with fog and clouds so no point in climbing the tower for the view. All the campers who headed up last night were gone. Most likely when it got cloudy and started thundering last night, they decided to get off the mountain and head for lower ground.
I should know now not to judge the trail by the elevation profile but I thought it was going to be an easy day since there were not a lot of steep climbs. Instead there were so many rocks, roots, mud and puddles that it was not easy at all in spite of the minimal ups and downs. Intermittent rain showers started mid day but the tree canopy kept me fairly dry. It eventually started raining pretty good. I did not care about getting wet since I was already drenched in sweat but I did not have a pack cover and did not want my gear to get wet. I previously used a trash compactor bag as a pack liner but switched to a Nylofume bag since it less bulky. But it is also shorter and does not quite cover the stuff at the top of my pack very good. I stopped to check my app to see how far the shelter was and looked up and saw it through the trees. Quite a few people had already taken refuge but I got out of the rain and ate lunch. In about 15 minutes the rain had ended so everyone started heading back out. I had gone 9 miles but it was only 2:00 so I moved on too.
The trail was easier with less rocks and roots but more mud at that point. I came to a nice area by the river and should have stopped and camped there but decided to get in a few more miles. I crossed Kelly Stand Road and their was another great camping spot right by the river but I don’t think it is a good idea to camp alone near a road. It was a gravel road but a couple of cars had already gone by. There were a couple of guys I camped with last night that were behind me so I thought about hanging around for awhile to see if they showed up but decided to keep moving. A mile and a half later I found a good spot by a logging road. It’s obvious this road is not used much. I think it is mostly used by mountain bikers. A long day so I set up camp. It is warm and muggy tonight so probably won’t sleep as well as last night.
Day 3 Logging road to William Douglas Shelter - 1638 to 1648.2 = 10.2 miles
Number one reason I don’t sleep in shelters. A guy walked by while I was packing up and said he had stayed at the cabin up on the mountain but had almost no sleep because of someone snoring so bad. He finally gave up at 3:30 and was on the trail by 4:00 am. I did not sleep well either because it was so warm. I read for a while then tossed and turned while listing to loud strange bird calls in the night. That’s the other reason I don’t like shelters because I feel like I am bothering others when I can’t sleep. I suppose if you can sleep through snoring then my iPad light is not going to keep you up.
Good thing I stopped when I did last night because because I immediately started a difficult climb up to Stratton Mountain. When I reached the fire tower, I climbed about half way to confirm what I already knew. No views because of the fog. But the wind sure felt good. Once I made it through the descent off the mountain, the trail was much easier than the last couple of days.
I made it to Stratton Pond at noon and stopped for lunch. It was very nice. I took off my shoes and socks and soaked my feet in the water. There was a nice breeze so I cooled off and let the sweat dry. The trail was not too bad in the afternoon and then the rain started about 2:30. Just like yesterday, it rain pretty good but it was over in about 15 - 20 minutes. I had a choice of 10 miles or 13 miles to a shelter. I am thinking of going into Manchester tomorrow so opted for 10 miles since that leaves just 6 miles to town. The William Douglas Shelter is 0.5 miles off the main trail but level trail although muddy due to the rain. I am the only one here so I guess no one wanted to make the trek off of the main trail.
My old pack, an Osprey Aura, really bothered my shoulders and it took constant adjustments and use of some old shoulder pads to cushion my shoulder straps to keep the pain at bay. A couple of people told me the pack was too big so maybe that contributed but I think it just did not fit me well. So I bought a Gossamer Gear Mariposa pack for this section. Yesterday, same problem, my left shoulder hurt so bad, I was contemplating having Gil mail me my old pack or buying something new. So today I packed things differently to move some of the weight off the left side and used my homemade foam pad shoulder cushions from the start instead of waiting until my shoulder started hurting. It was not perfect but much better today so maybe there is hope.
Storms moved through the area, no rain but it cooled things off so much more comfortable than when I arrived in camp.
Day 4 William Douglas Shelter to VT Rote 11/30 - 1648.2 to 1654 = 5.8 miles
Rain started around 8:00 but I was settled in so read for a while and then listened to the rain which just put me to sleep. Up at 6:00 but no hurry since just 6 miles today to get to town for much needed shower, laundry and resupply. My tent leaked a little so sleeping bag a little wet. I like my REI one man Quarter Dome but I think it has a design flaw. The rainfly does not cover the corners so it leaks on the side opposite from the vestibule. I patched a small hole and treated the bathtub bottom with sealer before I headed out which helped but it still leaks a little. Another wet and muddy day but made it to the highway before noon. I was told this was an easy place to hitchhike but I am not comfortable with that and it is a really busy road so I tried Uber. No drivers. Not interested in walking 3.5 miles so called the EconoLodge where I am staying and they gave me a ride for $10. Took a shower and walked next door to Bob’s Diner for lunch while my clothes washed. Tried Uber again for ride to town. No luck. Taxi was $15 for 2 miles to town so I decided to walk to the grocery store. Fortunately it clouded up so not too hot. The grocery store was open but I am learning that shops and restaurants are often not open or not open during posted times. I went to a gas station/market but when I opened the door, it was just a big open room, no market.","

VT Route 11/30 (Manchester) to Peru Peak Shelter 1654 - 1664.1 = 10.1 miles  
Leisurely morning since my ride to trail is at 9:00. When I walked outside, I could not believe how cool it felt. Fairly gradual climb for about 2 miles and I visited with a couple from California out for a day hike. Then a steep climb for about a half a mile. A bus load of students were also out for a hike and every few minutes I would pull over for a group of 10 - 15 to go by. Then the trail came out onto a wide grassy slope. When I saw the snow making machine, I realized Bromley Mountain was a ski area. I did not stick around since there were so many people but I read later that hikers can sleep overnight in the ski warming hut.
Trail dropped down to Mad Tom Notch with a gravel road. I decided it was a good time to stop for lunch. Jeff from Green Mountain House, a hostel near Manchester came by to replenish the cache of water jugs he maintains since there are no natural water sources in the area. I met Doppler and Queu an older couple heading to Maine too as well as a few other hikers. I am seeing one or two NOBO thru hikers a day. So far, all started in Georgia in April except one couple from Alaska started in March. Also seeing some SOBOs too that started at Katahdin in June. Everyone is moving quicker than me.
Another climb to Styles Peak and then Peru Peak. Slow going this afternoon. Then about a quarter mile before I reached the Peru Peak Shelter, I slipped and fell. Right knee and left hand banged up a little but nothing major. While I am sitting there on the ground trying to get motivated to get moving again, I figured I would take an Advil to get ahead of the pain I knew was coming. When I made it to the shelter, Doppler and Queu decided to go another half mile to the campground at Griffith Lake. I have a spot next to a stream so very peaceful. And I am alone once again. I was hoping for some company tonight but everyone that has come by is pushing on to get in more miles. Just heard someone walk up and I can hear them talking about the tent sites. And they are moving on too. Alone again. 

 Day 6 
Peru Peak Shelter to Greenwall Shelter - 1664.1 to 1678.6 = 14.5 miles 
Hit the trail by 7:30 and was at Griffith Lake in about 10 minutes. Nice tent sites there. Ran into Doppler and Queu and ate breakfast with them next to the lake. Nice and easy trail for the first few hours. At one point, I realized I was humming a song but not paying any attention. Then realized it was Kane Brown’s “Homesick”. I was feeling kind of homesick, missing Gil and the dogs. And the chickens. But I know from experience I usually feel that way at the begin of a trip then I am fine after I get into the groove of things. Hit a real gnarly set of rocks at Baker Peak that required climbing more than walking. Stopped at Little Rock Pond for lunch around 1:30. Very nice shelter and tent sites there too. I was really tempted to stay for the night but it was only 2:00 so kept moving. The trail was much more difficult in the afternoon. The climb was not too bad but lots of rocks and roots. Decided to try for Greenwall Shelter but Far Out says the water source is dry so stocked up on water at a stream 3.5 miles back. About a half a mile before the shelter, the wind picked up, it cooled down and got really dark. There was a hilly trail into the shelter and I was just trying to make it before the rain came. I got my tent set up and settled in and was getting my dinner stuff together to go over to the picnic table when major rain started. Now everything is wet and spattered with mud and leaf litter. But much cooler so I am a happy camper.
 
Day 7 
Greenwall Shelter to Hwy 103 1678.6 - 1686.4 = 7.8 miles 
Cool enough to put on long sleeves this morning especially since I will be stopping in 0.8 miles to get water at the stream and can change. Best trail so far this trip. If you have to climb a mountain then the climb to Bear Mountain is how it should be. Long sweeping switchbacks on almost rock free trails. Still hard and slow but as good as it can be. Just one really gnarly section of rock slabs at the very top. Made it to Hwy 103 where maybe there is a bus to Rutland and maybe not. I walked about a half mile to where it is supposed to pick up but saw nothing to indicate a bus stop so headed back to trail. Ran into the hikers from Maine and they also wanted to go into town so Timber tracked down a shuttle driver to take us to the Yellow Deli Hostel. This place is very controversial and considered a cult by some people but it appears to just be a faith based group of hippie type people who live a communal type life. They are nice and friendly and run the Yellow Deli which had awesome sandwiches and the hiker hostel during peak hiker season. Men’s bunks on Floor 2 and Women’s on Floor 3. Raven and I have a bunk room to ourselves. There is a nice bathroom with showers, washer/dryer and a common area with kitchen.
After getting settled in, I had to make a work call then walked over to Walmart for a few resupply items. Ate dinner across the street and finally showered and did laundry. We were able to hang our wet tents over the water pipe running over our heads in the common room so got everything covered. 
Day 8 
Hwy 4 to Hwy 103 - 1686.4 - 1704.1 = 17.7 miles
First one up at 5:30 so made coffee. Settled in with my coffee and my online newspaper and within 5 minutes, one of the other women sat down and started sorting and repackaging her resupply items. So much for a quiet start to my morning. Timber, Raven, Socrates (TRS) and I are slackpacking today. The buses in Vermont are free and the bus station is one block away and will drop us off at Hwy 4 and we will hike back to Hwy 103 where we got off trail yesterday. Just 17.7 miles. We got on the 7:15 bus but Timber accidentally said we we were heading to Hwy 103 instead of Hwy 4 so bus driver said we were on wrong bus. After we got off, we realized what happened but now we had to wait for the 8:15 bus. I decided to go back to the hostel to get my headlamp in case we did not get done before dark. Made it to the trail and made the 6 mile climb up to Killington Peak where the ski area is. Climbed the 0.2 mile wicked, steep final section to the top where there is a great view and food. The others were almost finished eating by time I got there but I got a sandwich and we watched the mountain bikers get off the gondola with their bikes after riding up so they can ride down the mountain. Then back down the wicked, steep section to start the final 12 miles. About 5 minutes after I got back on the trail, I realized my wallet was missing. I could not fathom having to make that steep climb up to the top one more time. I just started back up when I remembered I had put my puffy jacket on at top and sure enough, it was in my jacket pocket.
Then I started thinking what the hell was I thinking when I decided to slackpack with a group of people half my age. I am going as fast as I can but cannot come close to keeping up. They promised they would wait for me so I only took a couple of quick breaks and kept pushing on. They were waiting at the final lookout before the end of the trail and called the shuttle driver as soon as I got there. Only another half mile down a steep rock scramble and it was almost dark. But I made it and survived. When we got back to the hostel, we walked down the block for pizza but they refused to let us order because they were closing in 20 minutes. So ordered Dominos for delivery. Very long day and now the hostel is packed. Even the top bunks in our room are taken.

Hwy 4 to Stony Brook Shelter - 1704.1 - 1714.1 = 10 miles
Slept in until 6:00. Made coffee and read the paper before packing up. Hiker breakfast available at 8:00 in the Yellow Deli. Scrambled eggs with cheese, scoop of brown rice, apples, and the most awesome homemade scones made with spelt flour, apples and cinnamon. Caught the 9:15 bus back to the same trailhead as yesterday but heading north this time. Only 10 miles today. Long climb in the morning up to Sherburne Pass. The trail cuts through Gifford Woods State Park. A pretty, peaceful place so I stopped and sat at picnic table to eat a snack and watch the chickadees. Started to warm up but 70s warm instead of 80-90s warm. Then a steep climb up to Quimby Mountain. These steep uphills just kill me and never seem to get any easier. I was concerned because Far Out did not have any comments about water status in about a week and I was just about out. The stream was no longer running but there was a good size pool to dip from. Last two late nights are catching up to me so I I sure did not want to keep hiking in search of water. 
Day 10 
Stony Brook Shelter to Ascutney Mountain - 1714.1 - 1726.6 = 12.5 miles
I heard lots of people coming into camp last night and when I went to get my food bag from the Bear Box, it was jam packed so lots of people camped here last night. Saw a couple camped down by the water and then when I got to Stony Brook, a sea of tents all through the woods. Since it is so easy to get into Rutland and the Yellow Deli is also a big draw, I think a lot of people head in to town and then this is a good distance to make heading out even if you get a late start.
Climbed all morning but at least the climbs were broken up with some downhills. My goal was to get to The Lookout for lunch. It is a private cabin open to hikers. After eating lunch, I climbed a tall ladder to a small platform on the roof. It was a clear day with views of The Whites way off in the distance. That is where we are headed. Made it to Wintturi Shelter about 3:00 but too early to stop so ate a snack, topped off my water and headed out with TRS. Hiked another 2.5 miles and found a good camping spot on Ascutney Mountain so decided to stop. The others moved on. 
Day 11
Ascutney Mountain to a spot in the woods - 1726.6 - 1739.6 = 13 miles
Almost out of water after fixing coffee. And fuel canister is now empty. Easy morning and hiked a little over a mile to the first road and got water and ate breakfast. Hiked to the next road and stopped to to check the map and a car pulled up and TRS got out. They had hitched to a nearby restaurant for breakfast. They take tons of breaks so even though they hike fast, we often end up at the same place. Not too bad of a day, crossed multiple roads and streams in the morning. Afternoon prospects did not look too good for water so got water from a slow moving stream with lots of algae. Oh well, that is what filters are for. Rain showers started off and on around 2:00. Made it to Thistle Hill Shelter by 3:00 and once again too early to stop so kept on moving. Around 5:00, the terrain leveled off and I saw a couple of tents set up so decided this was a good time for me to stop too. Since I am out of fuel and cannot cook dinner, I just snacked. Heading into town tomorrow. 
Day 12 
Mile 1739.6 to Hanover, NH (1751) = 11.4 miles 
Woohoo, Vermont is done! Since I could not make coffee, I got up around 6:00 and started packing. I did mix my instant coffee in my Instant Breakfast but just not the same. Walked a short way to a stream and filled up with water. Then crossed the White River in West Hartford, VT where hikers were already jumping 50-60 feet off the bridge into the river at 8:30. I was encouraged to join them. Once upon a time I would have been up to the challenge but those days are gone. The trail follows a road through town and I finally had decent cell phone service to try and find a hotel in Hanover. But none to be found. This is the home of Dartmouth and if I had known there was such a shortage of rooms, I would I have booked something before I left Rutland. I did find something in White River Junction just south of Hanover. Back on the trail and even after stopping for a snack, I was really hungry. Made it to West Hatford about 2:00, long downhill road that killed my knees and detoured a short distance to Dan and Whit’s General Store. A really cool place with groceries, deli, pet supplies, hardware store, garden center and more. There motto is if they don’t have it, you don’t need it. I had Gatorade, pizza and ice cream. Feeling much better after that. The trail then follows a busy road over the Connecticut River and up a hill into Hanover. I passed a bus stop and talked to the driver about the bus system. Once I made it to Hanover, I went by the Post Office to pick up a package and then over to the bus stop. Waited about 5 minutes and the bus to White River Junction came and dropped me off about a block from my hotel. The hotel is across the street from the VAMC and I recognized it it from a business trip there about 15 years ago. A lot more built up now. So glad to be here. Taking tomorrow off. Time to recuperate before getting back on the trail. 
Day 13
Zero day. 
Last night, I did laundry and walked to a nearby market for a bottle of wine and a frozen dinner. This morning, coffee, newspaper, breakfast, finished my book. This afternoon, I took the bus over to the Food Co op to get a few resupply items and dinner for tonight. Missed the return bus so walked back the 1.6 miles. Should have waited because the bus drove by just as I got back to the hotel. Feeling rested but I am depressed because temps in high 80s next few days.","
