LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625080,"Don't know how far I'll get.
I've been itching to hike for quite some time.
I need to tackle the BIG mountains this year.
So I drove up to the trail town of Glencliff, New Hampshire, parked at a trail head parking lot and walked in the 0.3 miles to Jeffers Brook Shelter to stay the night.
This photo was taken last Fall but the shelter looks just the same now as it did then.",,View Entry,"Aug 07, Wed",0
LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625158,I waited out the morning rain and started out on the trail at about 12:45. This meant I was pushing to arrive at the shelter before dark and in fact I just arrived in the last light of the day. I would have had to put on my head lamp if I needed to walk another 0.1 of a mile. When I got up this morning I walked back to the car and drove over to Kinsman Notch to begin this year's Section hike. I started here as I have completed nearly every section from here south. The weather looked threatening and the forecast and radar showed imminent rain and I hate walking in the rain. I thought I would wait until the short duration storm passed so I drove into Lincoln for Coffee and a breakfast roll at DD and then went to the town library where I knew I could read and charge my phone. I didn't really need to charge it as I had it plugged in while I was driving.I also did some research on local hotels for when my brother and his wife would be here in early September. I was able to book us a couple of rooms before I drove back to the trail head at Kinsman Notch an head towards Eliza Brook.,"Kinsman Notch

With clear conditions and difficult terrain, I was exhausted by the time I got to the Shelter. I had to get water from the pond and during that exercise a mother goose with duckling came right up to me. Way cool..  
Up on North Kinsman in the afternoon, the pond is Lonesome Lake and the big mountains are the Franconia's where the AT continues North. Looks very daunting.","Eliza Brook Shelter

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625207,"I was up and on the trail in short order stopping at Lonesome Lake Hut for a snack and coffee. 

Arrived at the access trail to the Flume Visitor Center parking lot around noon 
Then walked down to the Rte 3 to hitch back to Kinsman Notch. No one stopped to pick me up until after a heavy thunderstorm moved through. I was able to wait it out under a nearby overpass. I did get picked up by a local couple who took me out of their way all the way to the notch. I found others there who had set up a table with food for hikers.  I visited for a good time and then said goodbye and headed back to Norwood. 
This is what a real Trail magic setup looks like. Everything a hiker would want @Kinsman Notch.","Kinsman Pond Shelter

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625208,"Tom and Margaret dropped me off at the trailhead on Rte 2.

So, after a most easy walk, we hikers call today a Nero, (nearly zero trail miles) I opted to lay over for the night at Rattle River Shelter, it being a no fee sight.Through out most of the high mountains of the White's most of the areas for sheltering or camping are on a fee basis, anywhere from $5 or $10 for forest service campgrounds to over $150 a night for full service AMC Huts.Plus is would be a stretch for me to go all the way to Imp Shelter in the daylight I had left. I'll do that stretch tomorrow.This is a typical low use shelter and while I was here many hikers passed going north as that is less than 2 miles of easy walking for them. I am the only one in the shelter but a couple came into the shelter area near dusk and set up their hammock. I did not engage them as I had settled in for the night and the next morning I left before they got up.This shelter area is right next to a very nice running brook with plenty of water for both drinking and, in warm weather, getting a good cooling soak.","NH Rte 2

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625209,"The hike was slow as I only needed less than 5 miles and I needed many breaks as I am terribly out of shape. It was up the first 3 miles then not so bad after that. Nonetheless, I arrived in the late afternoon and secured a spot in the shelter.","Rattle River Shelter 
",Imp Shelter ,"Aug 15, Thu",6.10
LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625272,I had good views today from Mt Hight and a nice rest on Carter Dome. I arrived at the Hut well before 4:00 which is the earliest AT Hikers are supposed to ask for work-for-stay. But I did anyway and then there was only one other hiker that asked after me which was just the right number that this Hut generally allows. I had to wait a while until after the Croo served and cleaned up dinner. Then we ate with the Croo and cleaned up the rest of the pots and dishes. At 9:30 the lights go out and we can then roll out our sleeping pads and bags on the dining room floor.,"Imp Shelter

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625274,So I didn't actually walk on the AT today but nearly 4 mile Nineteen Mile Brook Trail down to NH Rte 16 and then hitched to The Barn Hiker Hostel. I checked in with Paul around 2 o'clock and secured a bed upstairs. At 5:00 he took a carload of us hikers over to the Walmart to resupply. The reason I bypassed the WildCats is I had done this section in 1990 with some other friends and remember it well. This saved me a difficult climb and decent over a notoriously dangerous section.,"Carter Notch Hut
","Gorham, NH","Aug 17, Sat",0
LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625365,"Today I walked over Mt. Madison in good weather and clear skies. Let me explain what I did yesterday.
In the year 1990, I and 3 of my friends from then walked the AT from Carter Notch to Pinkam Notch in November. Since I am technically not Thru hiking but piecing together a section hike I can include the 5.9 miles of the AT from that year. And I will add an entry reflecting that hike.
I was shuttled up to Pinkham Notch in the Barn Hostel mobile, a 1986 Caddie with 3 other north bound thru hikers who I failed to get their names.


Paul drove us up to the notch with all our packs stuffed into the trunk. As I had not been able to have a hot coffee at the hostel but I did eat a breakfast sandwich that I had bought at the Cumberland Farms in Gorham, I headed to the lodge and sat for about 30 minutes with coffee. I then started out on the Madison Gulf rail for Osgood Campsite. the morning was warm and mostly in the 70's with few clouds. Halfway over to the campsite I crossed the Auto Tollroad that goes to the summit of Mt. Washington. This section is up and down and not terribly difficult to follow but does need ones concentration to keep on the proper AT.

There is no shelter here and it was only noon time so I ate a light lunch and continued up the Osgood Trail to Mt. Madison.

After a very strenuous uphill section the trail emerges from the trees and begins a long portion above treeline where hikers are required to stay within marked trails and cannot stay overnight except in the High Huts of the AMC. From this point I wasn't near the summit but had my first clear view of Mt. Washington. I also found plenty of ripe wild blueberries right along the trail side. I had to stop often just to taste a few at a time and they were very refreshing and had an intense flavor.

It took me almost 4 hours to go the 2.5 miles from Osgood Campsite to the summit of Madison. But I made it in good order after stopping often and sometimes more often to sample the blueberries. The clouds were threatening rain which really never developed but their ceiling was well above 5366 foot summit.
I arrived a little after 5 o'clock and secured a work-for-stay position with the Croo.TBC","Pinkham Notch

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625428,"I knew that today would be a busy day at the summit of Mt. Washington.





The Dungeon at Lake of the Clouds Hut. I did work for Stay upstairs but I do believe there was at least one hike in hear last night.

As I once again began today's hike, I looked back at The Hut, Mt. Washington and the trail crew working on improvements to the 200 year old Crawford Path that I would walk today.


This is one of my favorite photos fro, today. It shows the rugged trail tread, the wild mountain blue berries in there encroachment to the trail and my boot for perspective.

I am staying tonight at the Mizpah Hut right next to this campsite but I neglected to take any photos of this hut. Nonetheless, this area was interesting by the fact that there had been some recent weather damage to the area with significant blow-downs that opened up the tree canopy and giving a new habitat to the wildlife there.","Lake of the Clouds Hut
",Mizpah Springs Hut,"Aug 20, Tue",4.60
LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625660,"Today I was hoping to get to the Ethan Pond Shelter. To do this I would have to transit Crawford Notch which has a rather daunting cliff to descend. But before I got there I needed to perform my work-for-stay duties at the hut which mostly meant that I needed to wait until all the guests had eaten their breakfast and the Croo had cleaned up after breakfast and they and the other AT hikers doing work-for-stay had their meal. It was too long though to straighten up the bunk rooms and sweep as everyone was so helpful. I think I was on the trail by a little after 9 o'clock. 

The morning walk to the Webster Cliffs to me over Mt. Jackson, the southern most 4000 foot summit of the Presidentials, and Mt. Webster which is not quite 4000 feet.

The AT running south along the Webster Cliffs is one of the most scenic sections of the trail that I have experienced. The trail meanders down the ridge at times very close to the edge and involves many difficult maneuvers with long step downs. The opportunities for missteps are many with possibly disastrous consequences. This means being very conservative with planning the actual way across these challenges which obviuosly slowed my pace down to much less than a mile per hour.

Even though for the most part I was walking on a descending trail it was with great effort and I needed to take several rest breaks. This was fine as I could then take nourishment and drink as well as take in the fine views all around me. This photo of the trail I just came down shows the steepness that faces the hiker going either way on the AT.As I came off the steepest part of the trail, the weather turned dark and the threat of rain became real. Less than a mile from the US Rte 302 trailhead the rain started and intensified to the point that I needed to stop and gear up under my rain poncho. Did I ever say that I hate walking in rain (and also bicycling in it) so I decided to hitch back to Durham for the night. It took me most of an hour to catch a ride down to the junction with Rte 16 and then only a short time to catch another all the way over to The Barn Hiker Hostel.","Mizpah Springs Hut
