Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608284,"Three weeks out
Three weeks from now, assuming all will go as planned, I will be started out for my Appalachian Trail hike.  To avoid crowds and disease (those things go together, as much as it sound misanthropic), I will be starting from the middle of the trail, at Harper's Ferry, and will work my way up north.  If all goes as planned, when I reach the northern terminus I'll fly back down to Harper's Ferry and continue south.  This method is generally called ""flip-flopping"", and comes with the added benefit of more temperate weather and a less crowded trail.  I suspect most folks want the satisfaction of saying they went straight from one end to the other - from Georgia to Maine.  But I am happy not to have that itch to scratch.
I am planning to hike the whole trail, barring any injury or anything like that.  This will be my first time overnight backpacking, but not my first time hiking.  I've hiked a reasonable amount and know some of my limitations (related note: bulk ibuprofen was purchased today!).  I recently loaded up an older pack and hiked during the rain, revealing even more weaknesses... my knee flared up due to the pack weight, and I didn't have rain clothes.  Lessons are still being learned before I get out on the trail...
Why hike the trail?
In a way this is my Walden, except with my cabin carried on my back.  I don't want to coast along through life like driftwood, only to find at the end that I haven't really lived.  I want to try to experience life in the bare.  A wise mean once said to look at the lives of the birds and the lillies, how simple their lives are and how little worried they are about the future.  If I can learn to live simply and be happy with my lot on the trail, I feel I can be ready for any of life's curve balls.
I don't want to fool myself into thinking this is some naturalist back-to-nature crusade.  My pack, while not entirely ultralight, has its weight kept down because of modern technology.  Planning and navigation is helped immensely by modern technology.  And I will be keeping a trail journal here thanks to modern technology!

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608456,"Sick today, and wondering what it will be like sick on the trail...Got a notification that my custom sleeping bag/quilt will ship tomorrow.  I've been really worried it won't arrive in time - next week is now my last at my job, and I'm having it shipped to my office.  Looks like it should make it!I have been thinking more and more that I really don't like the direction life has taken me recently.  I can see myself getting older and becoming more bitter.  I've scared myself the last two Christmases with how much of a humbug I was.  How can it be that I don't want to be a certain way, or have a certain attitude, but can't help it?  As if I can look outside of myself and know instantly that I don't want to be that way, but keep on being that way nonetheless.  Sort of like the weakness of the will - knowing what is best for me but not following through with it.I am hoping the time on the trail will give me some time to reflect and become better, and hopefully turn away from this path...",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Wed",0

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609709,"I don’t think it’s entirely dawned on me, but my first day on the AT will be tomorrow.  Technically later today, as I need to use the AT to get to my hotel for the night.


I’m currently in Washington DC, enjoying another beautiful day.  Sitting outside a Philz coffee enjoying my overpriced coffee.  From here on out I will have to make my own instant coffees, and I know they won’t taste as good as this.


Yesterday I took a very long walk and picked up some last minute items at an REI near Union Station.  Also grabbed some luxuries at Trader Joe’s, including cheese and fruits.  Wow, I know I will crave these things on the trail.  I am not sure I appreciate just how much I appreciate these things.


I struggled with the walk home with the paper Trader Joe’s bag and a paper bag with REI stuff with a loaf of sourdough wheat from Paul’s bakery (a place my friend Yuka showed me in Japan - and they only have locations here on the east coast).  Bread - another luxury I know I will crave.  Time to get used to backpacker food.


I also bought a ton of nuts at Trader Joe’s - much more than I can carry, so I shipped out my first USPS Priority Mail box to myself.  Kinda pricey at $20.  I hope my future self appreciates the goodies inside.  I shipped it ahead about a week, which may be too soon.  But the nice thing about Priority Mail is that, if left unopened, you can apparently “bounce” the box ahead of you.  In any case, I know one way or another that I have an appointment at a post office in some town I have never heard of until now.


It was originally scheduled to rain a bit on my first few days of my hike, but now the forecast has cleared up a little bit.  I have still not setup my tent even once (probably a mistake - something I should try to tonight in my hotel room).  I am thankful if I won’t have to learn how to set it up in the rain, but I will just need to deal with it.


In DC yesterday I visited two museums I hadn’t been to - the American Indian museum and the Natural History museum.  the former was interesting, but not as well done as the Smithsonian’s exhibit on the American Indian in Anchorage, which was fantastic.  There were still some small things that resonated, even though this isn’t really my culture.  Different cultures with different ways of viewing life as a series of stages, of seasons and as compass directions.  Each person has their own season, their own direction.  Stories of Sasquatch man - wilderness man.  Stories of boys who go on long wilderness treks and return to the village changed, as a man.  They return to a changed village as a changed person.",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Sat",0
Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609893,"It rained overnight, but I stayed dry and warm inside my tent!  A successful first night on the AT!


Plus there was an unexpectedly tough hill climb in the middle of yesterday’s hike.  This all lead me to turn in early.  I’m glad I did, since I was able to take my time setting up my tent and cooking my first meal - freeze dried spaghetti (it was really tasty actually!).  After that I brushed my teeth and tucked myself in early, and not long after that the first few drops fell.  Turns out I setup the tent right - nothing got in.  I put my pack with my rain cover on it in the vestibule, but didn’t quite trust it not to get wet, so I managed to bring the pack completely inside the tent.  It made for a tight fit, but it worked out surprisingly well.


I did however leave my shoes out in the vestibule, a bit wrapped up with the rain tarp, so they didn’t get wet!  I think I neglected to tie that front flap down - it seems too loose.


Today a thunderstorm and rain was originally forecast, but now things have cleared up!  Rocky Run shelter is 9.1 miles ahead, and I’ll aim for that.  The shelter I originally wanted to camp at tonight is about 4 miles ahead, so that will be a good lunch stop.


I’ll be sure not to make the mistake of not carrying water through the day.  That one “unsweet” iced tea from town had to last me through most of yesterday, and I was getting pretty thirsty by the time I arrived into camp.  How delicious that cold water tasted - from a plastic pipe sticking out of the stream.","Ed Garvey Memorial Shelter

Dahlgren backpacker’s campsite was amazing!  Flush toilets, free showers with hot and cold water.  Luxury.


Tempted to stay here and rest, but I want to keep moving on.


Saw some deep red bird, almost tropical looking.  Woodpeckers heard but not seen.  The usual crows.  Owls as well.  Other birds that sound new to me.


Met Piper at the campsite today.  He also saw me at Ed Garvey shelter.


Guesstimating two more days of walking till I go to a town to take a break.  I am trying to figure out how to guesstimate and budget the miles.


Food is dwindling.  The luxury Mountain House meals are disappearing now, and I’m running down to the tuna packets, the more traditional backpacker food.


Hopefully will make good progress today.  If not, no worries - then I’ll resupply in Smithsburg.","Ed Garvey shelter

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610130,"I can see how folks end up injured when they push themselves to go harder than they should.  The third day out on the trail I was trying to get in enough miles which would make it possible for me to get into town the following day.  Ensign Cowell shelter was about five or so miles ahead of where I should have really camped.  However, my supplies were running low and I knew I needed to get into town to resupply.



It’s interesting to experience the more popular areas of the trail - areas where hiker numbers start swelling up.  Annapolis Rocks was one of these spots.  It looked like even some overnight backpackers, maybe on spring break, we’re headed up there.


That’s a sort of hard decision to make at all of these junctures.  After following white blazes for so long, you come to a fork in the trail and blue blazes lead you off to the side - to some point of interest or other.  I have been a bit hesitant, but have simply taken off my pack at these junctures and set it on the ground while a more nimble me goes to scout out the location.  In the case of Annapolis Rocks it was a downhill trail, maybe 0.3 miles or so down to see an ok view.  Then a trudge back uphill.  Doh!


All of these side trips add up, so I know my actual amount of walking will definitely be than the “official” AT mileage.  So best to minimize these sorts of trips.  But I don’t want to miss anything!


I made it to Ensign Cowell shelter in the evening and assumed the shelter was already occupied, so I was busy looking for a safe sleeping pad to tent up at.  However, with the strong winds and the amount of suspicious dead limbs hanging above all tent pad sites, I decided to finally bite the bullet and go for the shelter.  No one was there at the moment, and I tried to convince myself to deal with the fact that folks might likely arrive later.  But they didn’t.


I setup my air mattress directly on the floor of the shelter, then put my quilt on top of that.  Nice not having to setup and tear down a tent!


The “missing” third wall of the shelter gave me this great perspective over the landscape in front of me, with my bear bag hanging prominently on the bear pole in the foreground.


I pretty much tried to use the quilt as a sleeping bag, so I buckled up all the pieces I needed to.  But it was drafty unfortunately.  I am still not entirely sure what I did wrong, but I made sure in any cade to note that sleeping in a shelter would be colder than in my tent.


Amazingly I still have no blisters - the Hiker Goo I have been applying every day seems to work wonders!


Today’s Guthook app overlook had me going 2,600ft ascent and 2,600ft descent - a roller coaster.  Ran into some folks coming down the South Mountain - couldn’t figure out from where to where.  Maybe they were going shelter to shelter in the opposite direction?


Definitely the best view I’d seen since starting a few days back at Harper’s Ferry.  And the side trail was short and flat!  Great!


Finally made my way down after that - I thought it was the last decent of the day, so the hardest part behind me (how wrong I was).  Made it down super rocky terrain doing some boulder hopping going downhill, so slow progress.  The white blazes sometimes seem to be positioned to lead hikers astray somehow.  I had to be vigilant to keep looking for the next white blaze.  And in some cases in this area they were 90 degrees from where I had expected to see it!


Finally arrived in Pen Mar park, where I was planning to go off trail to hike into town, where I booked a hotel for two nights.  Thought about booking just one night, but I really want to rest.  And after today’s walk to the hotel, I will definitely need more rest!


I hiked over the famous Mason-Dixon Line and crossed into Pennsylvania (which means I have completed the entire Maryland stretch of the AT!).  From there I hiked into Rouserville, where I aimed to pick up a package of mostly Trader Joe’s goodies I mailed myself from D.C.  I finally made it to the post office and picked up the package, but it felt a bit dangerous walking on the shoulder of the road.  In some cases the shoulder disappeared entirely, and I had to really put my faith in the drivers, who luckily were all with it enough to move over a little and leave space.


Tried two beers, but they were just ok.  One which is more local - Yuengling - based in Pennsylvania and incidentally the oldest operating brewery in the U.S.  And the other which was New Belgium’s Voodoo Ranger IPA.  The latter was more to my taste but was just ok.  The food hit the spot better.


It did feel weird because that bar was obviously for locals - but before leaving some of the guys asked me which direction I was headed.  That’s the right sort of AT question to ask - and they ought to know, living so close to the AT.  A second guy cheered me on - I saw him get on his motorcycle outside as I was leaving, and he smiled at me and said “get ‘er done!”, which I wasn’t expecting.  No one in the liberal Bay Area would ever say that nonironically, but it’s great to be free of the Bay Area.  I know exactly what the man was saying to me, and how he was encouraging me.  Still, these two sides of America still seem so alien to me.  I don’t feel at home in either political extreme (I feel more at home in the woods to be honest).


After that was the challenge I had created for myself due to lack of research.  The hotel was 3.5 miles away, and I decided to walk it.  This was a bad idea.  There were actually Lyft rides available with a small wait, as well as volunteer AT shuttle drivers, which also expected payment.  But I was stubborn and cheap, so with my backpack and large USPS box, I walked dangerously on the side of the road from Rouserville - which evidently doesn’t believe in sidewalks - into Waynesboro, which thankfully does!


Picked up some supplies at a marker and ended up holding onto even more stuff - add two plastic bags to the load!


Finally made it to the hotel with burning and aching feet.  Because of my poor planning with picking such a far-out option (there were definitely closer, more pricey options), today actually ended up being the longest stretch so far, according to Fitbit.  I could feel areas of my feet that have listed before... I could feel them burning, so I expected the worst.


I pulled off my shoes and peeled off my socks to find - again, no significant blisters.  I was as shocked as yesterday, when I put in a similar mileage.  What the heck!  This Hiker Goo stuff I’ve been messily applying each day must really work!  So thankful, but I know I can’t ward off blisters forever... they will come soon enough.","

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610196,"Yesterday (April 20) turned out to be the longest trek so far, and much of that was just getting from the AT to my distant hotel.  I haphazardly researched the distance from the trail and paid the price.  This Days Inn is 5.4 miles from the trail, mostly downhill luckily.  I trudged through, did my first post office run to pickup a package I mailed myself (mostly lots of nuts from Trader Joe’s), even picked up some groceries on the way, because I known I would never want to backtrack over to that store.  I was wincing a little bit from the soreness and being overloaded... but was super thankful to arrive at the hotel.


Two nights here may be a little excessive, but it’s nice to regroup and also explore the city a little bit.  I didn’t really like Rouzerville (which you need to walk through to get the Waynesboro), mostly because they have no sidewalks, and it felt super dangerous walking on some of the narrow roads.  Waynesboro on the other hand has nice sidewalks and interesting older architecture, and some shops and restaurants.


It has a nice feeling, but the sidewalks do seem desolate.  Maybe they are mostly just used by tourists like me, wanting to check out the shops and restaurants.  This seems to sadly be the case for a lot of American cities.  Weird feeling to be walking around alone on the sidewalks, like there is something wrong with me for not having a car.  Or maybe I look homeless (oh wait, I actually am technically homeless right now...).


Sad feeling to come across one lone pedestrian in front of me at night, and it’s unusual for them that they get suspicious and do a complete 180 to check behind them to make sure I’m not some shady character.  I hate this feeling in American cities, where sidewalks are so unfrequented...


Tried a few restaurants.  Waynesburger was kinda average, but I may stop in again if I’m in town for lunch tomorrow.  For a light dinner I had five pieces of sashimi at Sapporo Japanese, a Korean-owned place.  Best meal so far on the AT, which was super surprising.  I expected the standard American fare to be better out here, but I’ve been pretty disappointed in the food and local beers.  Sapporo was really good and appropriately priced (pricey, as is all sushi...).  The only thing missing was good sake or Japanese beer.. but they have some BYOB policy which I think has something to do with some outdated Pennsylvania state law or something.  It’s kind of a shame, but oh well!


Just a few more things on this lazy day - I did laundry in the sink.  Got out lots of dirty!  My polypropylene socks were getting too dirty, which is not good for my feet.


Also stopped in my first Dollar General and went up and down every single aisle to get a feel for what they have and don’t have.  I have a feeling I’ll be frequenting these a lot...


Started planning out the next few stretches, seeing where I can restock and where the next hotel may be.  I feel pretty satisfied that just one night will be nice for a recharge next time, but I’ll see how my feet feel!  I have a feeling I will not be blister-free on my next hotel stay...


Planning to get a Lyft or call a shuttle driver for the ride back to Pen Mar park tomorrow.  Got a decent supply of nuts, beef jerky, and tuna packages - I am guessing I’m good for another three to four days at least.  Next convenient resupply location is in Pine Grove Furnace store, 37.5 miles up the trail, which I now know is totally doable!  Going to try to not overdo it.


Mileages for tomorrow’s possible shelters:


1066.5 Pen Mar road (planning to get dropped off around here)
1071.1 Deer Lick shelters (little too near)
1074.7 Tumbling Run shelters
1081.3 Rocky Mountain shelters (little too far, stretch goal)","

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610324,"Only did 8.5 miles today.  Didn’t want to overdo it, and also didn’t want to hike in the rain today.  Big thunderstorm passed through here last night.


Tumbling Run shelters were awesome.  Really well maintained shelters with a super clean privy (what they call outhouses out here) with air fresheners and hand sanitizer.  Nature Conservancy and AT magazines inside, and a nice covered table with a rose on it.  Only thing weird are these creepy ceramic faces they’ve put up in the trees... seems familiar, like something folks used to do years ago, maybe in the 80’s or so.



The AT seems to pass right by here, so I suspect they were just passing through.  They had all their rain gear on, so I guess they were prepared to keep going.  I have my Frogg Toggs cheap raingear, but haven’t used it yet.  I suspect I will eventually.


They said the next week or two is a really nice stretch of trail.  After that it gets more rocky - the man used the term I’d seen once before - Rockslyvania.  These two caretakers are avid hikers and I think hiked the entire AT.  They also hiked the John Muir trail, a 200+ mile stretch that I’ve only done part of on a day hike.  After just these few days on the AT, my confidence is higher that I could tackle those scarier high-altitude hikes in the Sierras.


Mailed myself a resupply in Duncannon yesterday.  It’s nice to set these mini-goalposts, and have something to look forward to.  This resupply is a little farther away this time.  Interestingly, I saw an Amish or Mennonite lady at the post office with her daughter.  Pretty sure her daughter saw my pack lying in the corner and asked “what’s that, mommy?”


I totally understand their back-to-nature or simple life aims, but there is enough modern tech packed into that backpack that makes it much easier to hike the AT.  At the very least all that modern tech makes things lighter, not to mention the advent of cellphones to help with navigation and also comfort (as much as I like the sound of rain and thunder, it was super comfortable to be able to listen to music on my headphones last night).  For all the evils that tech brings, there are also clear benefits... and those mysterious gadgets packed into my backpack helps get out in nature in many ways.


Aiming for around 12 miles today.  There’s a restaurant up ahead called Timbers, recommended by the caretakers of this shelter.  They even have the restaurant menu here, with recommendations highlighted!","

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610466,"I originally planned for the day to end 7.4 miles back at Quarry Gap shelters, but there was a huge boy scout troop there that had taken over the area.  When I passed through I saw them making dinner, so I didn’t even ask if they were staying the night, just assumed it...


Yesterday I ran into a large hiker who was doing a section hike that, combined with his previous hikes, would finish up his AT hiking.  He warned me about the weather tomorrow - supposed to be rain and thunderstorms all day.  This would factor into my rationale for today’s long hike...


Hiked all the way to just before Caledonia State Park, and I headed west on the highway I was supposed to cross leading into it.  There was a restaurant there called Timbers that was hiker friendly and recommended by the previous shelter’s maintainers.  They even had a menu for the restaurant inside the shelter!


I got a giant two patty burger, a few unsweetened iced teas, and a vanilla milkshake.  They were super nice to me and had me sign their hiker guestbook.  They even filled up my water bottle for me!  Great service.  The food was also way better than the American fare in Waynesboro.  Timbers has a great chargrilled burger that’s been the best so far.  Finally the tide turned - previously the best place I dined at was a Japanese food place in Waynesboro, which wasn’t even run by Japanese folks, but Korean folks.  So far leading to that, all the American fare places were kind of misses...


It also turned out to be the fuel that kept me going through pretty much a second day of hiking packed all into the evening.


After Caledonia, the AT seems to go straight uphill for a ways, in what was probably the hardest part of the day’s climb.  After that I looked forward to the usual waypoints on my map to mark my progress - streams, gas lines, and power lines.  If only life itself was setup this way, with waypoints to let you know you were on the right track, and making progress...


Arrived in Quarry Gap shelters, which was recommended to me by the Tumbling Run maintainers, but the entire site was overrun with Boy Scouts.  Maybe there were some tent sites available, but I really wanted to sleep in a quieter area, so I trudged on.  If it was going to rain all the next day, the heck with it I thought, I may as well make some progress this evening instead.


I was a bit paranoid of where to store my food at these places.  I could do the PCT bear bag hang if I remembered how to do it - and I didn’t - if I could find a good enough branch on a tree.  I think there were a few good candidates for this, but I didn’t do it.  Maybe it was fear at being of one of these relatively remote campsites alone.


I started my unplanned evening hike, which turned into a night hike with my small flashlight.  This is an awesome flashlight with three power settings, the highest which lit up the path ahead very well, but also drained the battery fast.  Because of that I was conservative and kept it on the lowest setting.  My backup battery was buried somewhere in my pack...


Of course the forest at night was creepy, with all sorts of sounds I hadn’t heard before.  I was expecting strange eyes to be peering back at me when I shone my light into the darkness, but I didn’t see anything.  I was half relieved and half disappointed, recounting one of my night hikes in Big Bear, where yellow and green eyes scoped me out from the sides of the trail.


As I got closer to the shelter, with greater frequency I passed active tent sites.  People would be freaked out when they heard this crazy night hiker approaching, shining their flashlights in my direction.  One group I passed was some teenagers or mid twenties folks having a party.  They were half joking around to themselves after seeing me - “did you bring a gun?”.  Great, I am more likely to be killed out here by one of my own rather than a bear or whatnot.


I heard some shouting and partying when I approached the shelter, but thankfully it was in the distance.  The shelter was entirely quiet.  There were so many tents that it resembled the homeless tent city back in Santa Cruz.


Around 9:45pm I setup my tent with my flashlight in my mouth, making sure to prepare for the coming rain in the morning.  Success!  It pays to have practice... (I obviously need practice with that PCT bear hang, so I can be comfortable camping anywhere).  Didn’t care about inflating the inflatable mattress tonight, and thought it would make too much noise.  To be honest the cool ground felt relaxing.


It was a cold night - I added my sleeping liner to the mix tonight.  Despite the cold I think this was my most comfortable night, probably due to how tired I was.


It’s morning now, and it sounds like there is a Boy Scout camp and more all around me, waking up and cooking.  It’s funny, at first I thought these folks talking and messing about with tents were super late night hikers being rude.  But the growing glow surrounding the tent wasn’t the moon or some rude person shining their light at my tent - it was folks waking up for the morning.  I hadn’t expected to sleep so well... really expected to wake up far more often.  But the night passed too quick.


Now it doesn’t seem to be raining - did the forecast change?  Can my feet take more walking today?","

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610495,"Yesterday was a little bit rainy and very muddy all through the day.  After the marathon 19+ miles from the previous day, my feet were surprisingly ok, but my back started to give me a little pain through the day.  Seemed to have been helped by simply shifting the weight of my pack.  I think I have muscles back there that have rarely been used (I swear, years ago on some trip to Japan I overpacked and had a way heavier pack than this that gave me so many issues... thankful not to run into those sort of crippling problems... yet).


First time using this goofy looking Frogg Toggs rain gear, just the jacket.  Turned out not to rain enough to even justify wearing it today... but it was handy to have in case of a sudden downpour.
Some other hikers stayed there as well - looks like they got caught in the downpour and were a little soaked.  We chatted a little - the man had been working on the AT for 8-9 years in small section hikes.  This time they were starting up here and making their way down to Harper’s Ferry.  I guess they will make it, but I was skeptical since they seemed to want to fall asleep in that shelter in the middle of the day.  I guess it’s worth taking time to dry out!


Made it to Pine Grove Furnace and grabbed a light resupply at the General Store.  Surprised that they also had a short order cook, so I ordered a hamburger with fries.  Managed to also down two Pure Leaf teas and an orange juice.  Cash only - first place I’ve encountered that was like that.


Bad timing - the AT museum across the street closed at 4pm and was only open on weekends this time of the year (before the peak of hikers comes through).  Oh well.


Checked into Ironmasters Mansion Hostel and was able to pay with credit card.  This place was right on the train, and there is another thunderstorm coming through tonight, so I thought why not?  Got some laundry done and also got a shower out of it.  This is a really interesting historic mansion with some bunk beds setup in some rooms.  They also rent it out for special events like weddings.  Lots of history here for sure!  Iron was big way back when, in the 1700s.  They decimated the forest here to fuel the iron chimneys for smelting (?), but another industry took over soon after, which enabled this area to regrow.  You wouldn’t know by looking at it today - it’s pretty lush and beautiful.


More blossoms spotted - spring is getting closer and closer.  It gets more green as I head up north, I guess more a function of time, since the “spring front” moves from south to north.


Met a hiker named Chipper at the hostel - he was the only other one there.  Friendly and respectful, wouldn’t mind running into him again.  I hope my snoring didn’t keep him awake.


Enjoy this town but it’s small and the general store is closed weekdays, so on this Monday there’s not much else to do.  Glad to have spent one night here to recharge my batteries (my body’s and my phone’s), but it’s time to move on!


Beautiful morning but chilly.  Appreciate this day even more when compared to yesterday.","

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610539,"Stretch goal for today around 15 miles was the Alec Kennedy shelter, but you know what?  I knew I could do it but I was feeling like taking it easy, and the bottoms of my feet were sore (could have been easily solved with ibuprofen though I think).  Also, I don’t want to arrive in Duncannon too fast.  It’s just 30 miles away now, and one of my resupply packages will be mailed out just tomorrow.  Not sure if I should give my family a post office address further up the trail - it looks like the next convenient one near the trail is 100 miles ahead...


In any case, I have more time now to catch up with my writing and reading.  I should post more photos to Trailjournals!


Today was quite cold and windy, and a perfect day for my poof jacket.  No rain thankfully.  There are still a lot of muddy sections of the trail however, and some mud and water got into my shoes.  Just a bit.


Passed another market with a grill and just had to order a burger and fries.  I don’t know whether this is becoming a good habit or a bad habit, but it’s been something to look forward to.  I even had a vanilla ice cream cone.


Bought some more jerky and snacks at the general store, in addition to some mints I was craving.  I should have read the ingredients more carefully - they had aspartame in them.  I won’t go into TOO many details, but further on up the trail was my first pooping-in-the-woods experience on the AT, and I am pretty sure it’s related to that aspartame.  It went ok.  Heck I’m glad I got practice with those old Japanese squat toilets, it’s basically the same deal.


I think I almost have my sleeping situation worked out, and it seems my sleeping pad may be more annoying than not.  But it provides a great reflective warmth, which I will miss out on...  wonder if I can maybe partially inflate it to get the same effect...  hmm, maybe this sleeping situation isn’t quite squared away after all...","

-nice variety of scenery, from the old familiar leafless forests still in winter mode to the AT winding between farm fields
-great trail town - Boiling Springs looked nice from what I visited.  Fishermen and a nice pond with a real swan, plus lots of ducks (including sadly a group mourning their dead).  Plus some decent restaurants.
-got to eat a real lunch at a cafe that had Mexican food.  Had chips with guacamole and fajitas!
-saw more wildlife!  Three deer, about 5-6 rabbits, countless squirrels, a horse, cows, a wild turkey



-there was a long 11 mile stretch in which camping wasn’t allowed, so all hikers have to press through here.  I started this around 4pm after being convinced it was an easy hike (most of it was - it was flat, but I went slower than I thought I would)
-this day really wore me out and frustrated me by the next day, dampening my spirits
-the most mud I’ve hiked through today, which almost sucked off my shoes in some places.  Especially bad in the farm fields.
-2 hours of night hiking, which I am more comfortable with now, but try to avoid.  It usually comes through my bad planning 
-didn’t see the bear box at the shelter, and wasted a lot of time trying to hang my bear bag in the dark (eventual success!)
-flashlight battery finally died trying to hang the bear bag
-didn’t want to disturb folks in the shelter because of my late arrival, so I setup a tent far enough away not to make noises.  Everywhere was covered in leaves and I didn’t see that it was a very rocky area.  Also discovered I setup right on top of some animal scat...
-left the rain cover off because no rain was forecast, but at 4:45am was awakened to a rain shower..  Got everything wet, and I had to scramble out to setup the tarp
-got really frustrated after this and violently slammed back down on my air mattress, which ripped a hole in my tent and air mattress, the latter which started to deflate.  Tried to use the in-field patch kit, which seemed to work ok at the time.






4/17
Spirits were dampened because of the above events, so I didn’t want to push myself to make it 11+ miles into Duncannon, the next trail town I’m looking forward to staying at.  Luckily the next shelter was just over 7 miles away, so I aimed for that.


Got a really late start and tried to really take my time and enjoy myself this morning.  Left just before noon, which is quite late.


Starting to get quite rocky, which slowed me down a lot.  Also some pretty hard uphill climbs.


Got passed by a thru hiker who started in early February!  He was friendly and encouraging.  Said it takes about a month to get trail legs, and after that I’d be unstoppable.


Arrived at my campsite with plenty of daylight to spare, so I cooked up a nice Mountain House meal (last one I have left) plus some coffee.


Noticed a pinhole leak in my Smart Water bottle, which I was hoping would last me the whole way.  Also managed to drop the bag my Sawyer filter came with, which holds my other 1L of water, and it’s seam split across the top.  I am breaking everything these days...


Nice to have Cove Mountain shelter to myself.  Thought there was another hiker arriving, but it turned out to be a parade of wild turkeys coming in the evening.  That was unexpected!  If anything I expected porcupines, which have apparently been problematic at this shelter.  So much so that anti-porcupine measures have been put into place: the stairway removed and replaced with some rocks with some jumping distance needed, plus some aluminum flashing on the side of the flooring to make the surface too slick for the porcupines.  It seems to have worked - I didn’t have any unexpected visitors last night!","

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610936,"Zero day today.  Time for some philosophy.One of the earliest trail logs I read had a hiker describing a butterfly that followed them for miles, giving some sort of cinema quality or special meaning to their hike.  Like the universe letting them know they are somehow special.


When we are younger I think we have the sense that we are somehow special, that we have some unique place in this world - some gift to offer the world.  But as most of us grow older, we lose this sense, as we never find what we were supposed to offer the world anyway.  The new battle becomes just struggling to stay afloat, for extending out lives and giving us more possibilities, more ways to find that meaning.  And just to stay out of pain and maybe go on a few vacations a year, that becomes enough somehow.  And so we settle into the routine.


We grow old and become not relevant to the world.  The world cares little about us, will go on turning without us, and we are nothing but a little irrelevant blip on its radar.  But how freeing this is - shouldn’t this also mean that the world becomes less relevant for us?  We travel more and experience more, and see so many peoples take themselves and their lives so seriously.  Can we not laugh at that?  Can we care less or zero about others’ opinions?


As I get older I find myself caring almost zero about what most folks think about me.  Is this not a free country?  I go to the bar downstairs and decide to have a water with my meal today and another patron cracks a joke about it.  What character role do I need to play to fit the mold for this place?  Do I need to always order a beer and smoke and sound gruffy and put on a show to maintain an appearance?  Or should I do what is most comfortable, others be damned?  The world is not completely irrelevant now, but it is less relevant than ever, thank goodness.  Give me water please.","

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611046,"Not too eventful today, just hiked a 11 mile day, which is in my “reasonable” range / not too hard, not too easy.  There were a bit of rain showers along the way - not in the forecast of course.  I broke open my umbrella and waited it out.  Also scrambled to put my rain cover over my pack.  I realized that having my electronics at the very top of the bag may be convenient, but it ensures they will get soaked first...  I will probably end up just keeping them there, but placing them in a ziplock bag.


Arrived at Peter’s Mt Shelter around 3pm, a little early (I started today around 8am).  The shelter was so nice, and some trail angels left some food and drinks in the bear box, which made me feel more at home, so I decided just to retire here for the day.


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> 300 rock steps, plus 300 regular steps.  But the water is the only source for miles around, so it had to be done...  it was nice and cool, and I was able to sit down on a rock besides the piped water while refilling my bottles (and myself!).  The hike back up was the toughest of the day.  Even without a pack, my heart was pounding and I started sweating profusely.  Took a few breaks, but finally made it.  That little excursion cinched it: ok, that’s it for the day.


Some folks on the Guthook app call that little walk a “descent into Mordor” because of the difficulty and the rock steps...


A few hours later, Long Legs arrived.  Super nice man who just retired from IBM.  He’s definitely going at a faster pace than me, so this may be my only encounter with him.  Like most things in life - sometimes people or places will be met for the first and last time all in the same day.  And then life goes on.

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611522,"Been a while since the last update.  These last few days were a little challenging, and I stayed out longer than I have before - 5 nights out hiking before ducking into a hotel here in Hamburg, Pennsylvania.


Over the past few days a few blisters have started to develop on the sides of my feet, where I’ve never had them before and never expected them.  I suspect a lot of the rocky trails have done this, with my feet rocking and bending on all sorts of angles.  I’ve treated the blisters by draining them with a pinhole and then covering them with leukotape, which I hope will be enough.  The largest one is unfortunately dime-sized.  I have been checking my feet everyday but that one seems to have gone unchecked.  These biggest blisters are on the outside edges of my feet, which are tricky to see or reach, so I suspect that’s part of the issue with the failed early detection.


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> We all stayed at the Microtel Inn here in Hamburg, and they bought me some drinks last night.  We didn’t do enough rounds for me to buy them drinks, which I regret, so I will try to pay that forward.


It does seem to be getting rockier, which isn’t so much of a challenge as it is tedious.  Looking down, trying to find optimal foot placements, then looking up occasionally to make sure I have a white blaze within view to follow.


From what I’ve heard, one of the toughest rock challenges in this state is just up ahead after town, so I’m prepared.  The kind caretaker at the 501 shelter, Borderline, advised me to try out some shoes with ankle cover, but I have been doing ok so far with the shoes I have now (despite the new blisters).  I can feel the rocks and my ankles bend to the angles of the boulders below me, but it’s a reassuring feeling that I’m used to.  I will see how it goes, but I am feeling good because this next week or so I should be finishing up Pennsylvania.  There are some rocks going into New Jersey, but they should taper off.


After that I am sure some new challenges lie ahead!


Was hoping to take a zero day here today, but this hotel was fully booked for a family reunion.  There is some rain today, but I may end up just going a little ways to a nearby campsite.


Happy to get a shower, laundry, and a Cabela’s run in.  The Wal Mart even had a ton of camping stuff, including the tent repair kit that I used to finally patch up my air mattress.  I located a second leak and patched things up, so I hope it will be good to go for a while!  I have been missing this barrier against the cold below me more than anything.","Microtel Hamburg

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611584,"Wanted today to be a lazy zero day, but it wasn’t meant to be.  I checked out of my room and headed to downtown Hamburg to pick up packages at the post office.  One was a package I had mailed myself from Duncannon which provided various refills (mouthwash, contact lens solution, etc).  The other package was one my mom mailed out to me, containing a lot of Mountain House meals which I’d previously ordered in bulk, plus a lot of other goodies and sweets and mints.  Thanks Mom!


After that I walked a few blocks to 1787 Brewing Company.  Ordered a flight of beers to sample, as well as a blue cheese burger.  To be honest the food was better than the beer, though I did enjoy the Blue Rocks (New England style IPA), the namesake of which was the massive boulder field northeast of town.  I suspect tomorrow will be the day I finally tackle this.


After lunch I ordered a Lyft and it dropped me off back on the trail.  It’s kind of a strange feeling - I enjoy visiting these trail towns and spending time here, just like traveling really.  But just before I get that existentialist tingly feeling - that “what am I doing here alone just eating overpriced food” - I get the urge to jump back on the trail.  Despite life being a directionless goalless void, my life now has a clear direction: North.


Made just a tiny bit of progress up the hill out of town (the trail on the ridge line ducked down at a steep angle to come into town, and it’s just as steep going up to the ridge on the other side).  Started to rain and I found myself getting a little wet.  Found a little unofficial campsite and decided to camp, out of laziness and wanting to stay out of the oncoming thunderstorm.


Windy day tomorrow, then more rain after that.  Lots of rain in the forecast for the next week.  But through that week I’m hoping to make progress to bring me mostly out of Pennsylvania and onto the next state - New Jersey.","Port Clinton

It’s the weekend again, and you can tell by the amount of people out hiking on the trails.  Pulpit Rock seems to be a popular lookout with the locals, especially a good place for selfies and picnics.  I ate lunch in a secluded area before summoning here - first time boiling up water for a large lunch - and I’m glad I did.  Pulpit Rock had a group of gabby teens gossiping about something or other.  There was a middle aged couple there that passed me eating lunch on the way up - told me I picked a great spot for lunch.  Only after did I realize it was a jab against the noisy group up there!

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611805,"What can I say, the rocks and boulders are definitely finally here.  This is the infamous “Rockslyvania” I’ve been hearing about.  Today was definitely the hardest for rocks, and probably in general. A few times I simply had to put my trekking poles away and simply use my hands and feet, like some kind of rock climber with a very large backpack.


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> It was raining all morning, and I was prepared with my ridiculous looking Frogg Toggs jacket, plus my rain cover for my pack.


It wasn’t really too bad, but there were a few times I was rock scrambling and slipped because of the moisture.  I was able to regain balance most times, except once where I was on my way to smash my face into the rocks after a slip, but my hands caught me... phew.


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> and later in the day I found myself at some infamous precipice, scrambling on top of boulders called Knife’s Edge.  Kind of freaky but I took it slow and did ok.


Pushed myself to keep going to Bake Oven Knob Shelter, and I felt in good strength.  Maybe my office legs are finally shedding, and my trail legs coming into strength?


Last unexpected bouldering and gripping onto rocks with both hands came less than a mile to the shelter, at Bake Oven Knob.  I kind of looked around and laughed... always seems like the trail planner is some maniac who plans the trickiest routes.


Managed to lower myself through the rocks without dying...  I did disturb some duck who was nesting in the rocks.  Scared me... she flew out and started calling for help, like I was gonna eat her or her chicks or something.  Just passing through, lady!  Gheesh.


Made it to the shelter at 7:15pm, happily with daylight to spare to cook and hang my bear bag.  The latter required more effort than usual, but I feel like I’m getting the hang of it (hang, get it?  Sorry...).


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> I didn’t mind that much - I was thankful just to have a place to put my head.  Backpacker’s Pantry Risotto dinner was awesome, took longer to cook than Mountain House meals though.  My big fuel canister is finally starting to peter out, not bad after three weeks..

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611934,"This was definitely the most challenging day. The rocks up Lehigh Gap are kind of crazy, and require straight up rock climbing skills.
I could have done a very lazy day today and saved this for tomorrow, but with rain in the forecast, I wanted these rocks to be as dry as possible..
There were some teens ahead of me intent on posing for pics, and one of them struggled for a good 10 minutes or so with a particularly scary section. I made it through - and with a pack!
I did say a little prayer at the bottom - I thought that really there was a chance that was my last day on earth if I slipped up somehow.
The trail started rocky as always, and very steep, straight uphill it seemed. Then the rocks got bigger as I went up, until they grew into boulders. The AT white blazes were clearly visible the entire way, and I followed their recommendations exactly, zigging and zagging with arrows and directed blazes. I am not a rock climber, but today I was. But I was happy to trust the advice of the blazes over my own instinct.
Best to take it one section at a time. See the direction I need to go in, work my way backwards making note of the footholds and handholds along the way, then going for it, taking a breather, and repeating the process.
When I got to the top, the teens were posing and talking about sticking out their butts for their Instagram photos. Up there had a great 360 view, but I just did not want to get that 360 photo... for fear of falling. Something pushed me to keep going and get out of there... some instinct maybe.
Up and over the other side and some big scary looking spiders (wolf spider?) were scrambling out of the rocks I was supposed to pass by. I did do at least one detour to avoid pissing off one of those guys...
Made it up and over the other side, and the trail got easier and more pleasant. Was getting worn out and the last stretch, as always, seemed to go slow, until reaching a campsite.
Incidentally, tonight I’m camped on top of a giant government superfund site. There was a zinc company nearby that destroyed this mountain I climbed up in the early 1900s, and the government has been trying to clean it up for decades... unfortunately for AT hikers like me, this means there is contaminated water for 20 miles or so, which makes this not so ideal to camp at. Drank about a half a liter, so I now have 1.5 liters left for tomorrow before reaching the next water, a little over 10 miles away. Should be ok.
Just a random side note - since my grandma died a few years back, I have been trying to take note of any memories I have of her. Today while walking I remembered her buying some books for me when I was a kid - some Berenstein Bears and Magic Schoolbus books. I remember how much I wanted those and how grateful I was to receive them... those were really good times. And now those moments are in the increasingly distant past, but they still make me happy in the present. These are the most emotionally tough moments on the AT so far - thinking about things like this, my future direction, and life in general. Those things are so damn stressful compared to the relatively easy goal of “where’s the next shelter for the day”.","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

Thankful for the stretches in between where there’s more gravel. Thankfully just rock scrambling today, no rock climbing.
Started to run out of water due to lack of water sources near the superfund site I camped on top of last night. Ended up doing a big detour down to a blue blaze trail at my first opportunity to get fresh clean water. Not too bad, just over 10 minutes downhill and about 15 uphill.
Feet were killing me today. Also had some pretty bad issues with my back early in the day. Those sharp pains under my left shoulder blade are killers, but somehow I get through it and things feel better as the day goes on. Maybe the pain from my feet end up counterbalancing?
Going on too many nights now without a trail town, so I think I was getting too demoralized. Wind Gap is just a few miles away, so I’m looking forward to a brief excursion there for some food and hopefully beer! Delaware Water Gap is about 20 miles away from my shelter now, technically doable in a day, but I am sure it’s rocky, so it’s hard to guess how long it will really take. That will be the last city of Pennsylvania, where I will for sure take a real zero day and enjoy the town.
After that it’s onto New Jersey. The first part has some rocks, but it’s supposed to taper off, thank goodness. I am sure glad I don’t live in eastern Pennsylvania - the hiking here is a challenge but is really not pleasant. Shoes holding out for now thankfully...","1263.9 tentsite

At first I thought it was turkeys, but I looked closer and noticed it was a mom bear with her brown cub behind me a ways, right on the trail. I got a not so great video of them before banging my trekking poles together, which sent them running away skittishly.
Was still a difficult hike with lots of rocks... but went into the town of Wind a Gap to stop at the cafe, which lifted my spirits. Broadway Cafe - super hiker friendly. Charged my phone and battery pack there, and they even offered to refill my water.

Chatted with the staff a bit, and in a bit in walked WrongWay, who I had assumed had passed me way up. Was good to see a familiar face. We also chatted with a section hiker there.
Finally left town and headed back on the trail around 1 or 2pm. Crossed the bridge into New Jersey and got closer to some weekender areas. Big picnic areas with lots of cars driving around. And a huge concentration of bear boxes and bear proof garbage that let me know I’m finally in bear country (as if my sighting a few days back wasn’t a good enough indication).
In the Dunnfield Creek area there was a large parking area with folks strewn about, seeming to be content about not venturing very far from their cars. The parking lot loop was super reminiscent of some crowded Yosemite parking areas. But like always, the farther I hiked in, the less people I saw.
Somewhere up the trail I got hungry again and sat on a rock to eat the turkey club sandwich I bought from the ice cream shop.
Went past “Backpacker Site #2” which looked like a big tent city. I imagine that some of those folks must be disappointed to have tried to escape one city and found themselves in the midst of another one.
Sunfish Pond was the next waypoint. Mostly some kids playing around here, and some older kids trying to look grown-up and puffing on cigars. A lot of my hike around this late had me breathing in that cigar smoke...
Saw an red-eyed turtle here, and a very tiny thing that looked like a snapping turtle.
Past the pond I saw no one for the rest of the hike. The clouds were closing in and the sky darkened so much even though sunset was only a few hours away. There were some little rain showers, but I checked the weather radar and found myself on the edge of the cell that came through. But soon after that my fortune changed for the worse - a fairly strong cell came right over me, just as I was walking across a pretty bare mountaintop. I tried to huddle under a tree a bit, but it was no use - I was getting soaked. In a super delayed fashion I resigned myself to my fate and put on my rain gear. Waited a bit for the rain to let up, but I wanted to make progress, so I kept hiking.
When the rain finally let up, I was treated to an amazing view of the mist lifting off the valley carved out by the Delaware River. Made sure to get lots of photos, including a 360 photo!
Kept making progress, but slipped a few times on rocks. Had one slip that was my first real fall of my AT trip. I fell sideways onto my left leg. I was fast to examine it for any fractures, but I got lucky this time. I am sure it would have been worse if the rocks were positioned differently...
Shoes got completely soaked... which looks like it may have brought on some more blisters..
Finally made it down to a road, with a sign to the Mohican Outdoor Center. Low mileage today at under 10 miles, but not bad considering it was raining, and the shelter was out of my range at 20+ miles from my starting point.
Turned out to be a super nice place with great food and atmosphere, and lots of interesting books. Kinda pricey for food, since they had an all-you-can-day style buffet. But it was good quality stuff.
Lodge was super comfy and reminded me of many years ago at the lodge at Camp La Verne.
They even had places to charge phones, and some WiFi, which turned out to be useful because of lack of cell phone reception. But I’m kind of torn whether it’s a good idea.

The terrain is definitely a bit different, with the trail winding its way around lakes and beaver bogs. I saw a giant beaver bog and heard strange sounds from what I could only assume were the beavers.
Also saw four snakes in the water, two of which were perched up in the branches of a plant in the water. Never have seen that before.
Still plenty of stretches with rocks - including a rock wall that the AT goes right through. I got a bit lost on the trail here... wasn’t expecting these sort of large rocks from NJ.

This is his 20th anniversary of his 1999 hike. He said it was definitely easier when he was just 20 years younger. Yet here he is, all the way from Springer Mountain in Georgia.
A really noisy group of campers were too close by. Their voices echoed around us for miles into the night, and they woke up surprisingly early the next morning to resume their volume, then made themselves even more annoying by banging things together and chanting while playing some game.

Short day today in term of miles - just 6.6 miles. The muscle above my right knee was really acting up and aching on downhills. The next trail town was only a few miles from where I started, but it took an agonizingly long time to get there with my hobbling steps. Looking back now, I should have simply had a snack with some ibuprofen.
Took a short detour into Culver’s Gap, which was disappointing. Gyp’s Tavern has just ok food but a good selection of beer on tap. The service wasn’t super great though - the waitress barely looked up from her phone. As I left, she was still glued to her phone. Nice area out back by the lake though - I should have just relaxed out there a while longer.
Sporting goods shop next door had mostly fishing stuff and car camping stuff. I don’t think they really understand what thru hikers want, and don’t care. Just grabbed an iced tea and the cashier gruffly said “is that it?” Hey, want to make money? You should be asking “what were you looking for that you couldn’t find?”
Made it out of Culver’s Gap and stopped at the first shelter I came to, which was taken over by another school group, shelter and all. I went straight into the shelter and said “hello” to the middle schoolers sitting around the table out front, but they just ignored me. I guess they aren’t supposed to talk to strangers. Or I look like some crazed homeless man coming in to raid their shelter.
A minute later the two girls sitting on the table out front left and then returned with their teacher. Their teacher tried to smooth things over a little by asking my trail name. “Hey everyone, meet Philosopher”. Maybe one hello in return, and also a question about how many miles I’d done. I told them about 280 or so, since I hadn’t looked it up in a while. But writing this now I realize I’d actually just passed 300 miles!
There was an afternoon thunderstorm, so of course the whole group crammed into the shelter and had their group meeting and such. I’m supposed to share it, so I told them it’s ok, but my bedtime was around 9pm or so. Around then I finally started inflating my air mattress and tucked myself in, and they gave me some distance and went off to their tents, their stuff still sort of strewn about the whole shelter.

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612938,"Woke up very early, motivated to leave the school group behind and get out early.
A teacher of the school group mentioned Sunrise Mountain up ahead as a little bit of a challenge. It was uphill, sure, but it was pretty easy to “summit”. At around 1,600 feet, can it even be considered a mountain anymore? I feel like whipping out a picture of the California Sierra and saying “that’s no mountain...” in a cheesy Crocodile Dundee sort of way.
Had a snack bar on the trail for breakfast, something I don’t do enough. Got to Mashipacong Shelter and had a second breakfast that I cooked up. I knew this shelter was the goal for the school group for today, so I knew I would make it far past there. Passed another shelter and kept marching on to High Point State Park.
My muscle above me knee initially felt ok, but eventually started to give me some pain. By the time I arrived at the state park, I was kind of hobbling along and needed a break.
The state park is pretty nice - a local group called the Friends of High Point donate boxes of Pepsi’s to be given out to thru hikers, with the single caveat that hikers need to sign their logbook. I saw that they also carried some other off brand soda and candies, so I grabbed a soda and a big bag of Runts, then lounged around inside a bit. Wonderful break!
Bit of a mistake though - I should have had a real lunch here instead of a bag of candies. But I think I needed all the sugar in any case.
Walked north a bit further to an observation platform and suddenly saw a giant obelisk resembling the Washington Monument in DC. Oh, I guess this is the logo I saw on all those shirts at the HQ, I thought to myself. Good place for another 360 photo...
According to comments on Guthook, this is supposed to be the “end” of the PA rocks. But I am not sure what folks mean exactly by “rocks”. I keep seeing jagged pointy rocks on the trail, but there’s definitely less of them. I am no longer cursing the ground I walk over.
High Point Shelter was my original destination for the day, but upon arriving there I found I still had energy to go a few more miles to the “Secret” Shelter run by Jim Murray, a former thru hiker who setup a shelter on his farm property.
Got in those next miles before sunset, which made me happy (it also means today was a loooong day). These next miles were beautiful, taking me through pastures and land that resembled my favorite parts of Pennsylvania. Never would have guessed that New Jersey looked so beautiful.
It got very muddy in the last few miles, maybe the worse I’ve yet seen. Also felt something funny near a toe on my left foot - I could swear a toenail had fallen off somehow. When I got to the shelter I found that the sock liner had simply torn open... Not bad after 300+ miles I guess.

A local guy came up to chat a bit. A little bit later WrongWay came up to stop and resupply and chat. I left and hiked just a little bit more until I got hungry again, so I waited till I got to Wallkill River to eat at a bench. Saw WrongWay crossing the bridge and waved at him.
This next section must have been the muddiest I’ve been through, with the mud again trying to suck off my shoes. Definitely got my feet wet and had to hike with some soggy feet for a least the last few miles to the shelter.
There was an abandoned house with a water spigot, but the spigot hadn’t yet been turned on for the season. Peaked inside and it seemed weird - just saw an office chair and some pizza boxes inside.
Went a bit further and relaxed at Pockuck Mountain Shelter for the night.
WrongWay heard something in the woods at night but couldn’t really make out any eyes shining back in his headlamp. The rustling in the bushes subsisted eventually, but kinda freaked us out. I got out of my sleeping bag temporarily to try to look for it, and I was shivering a lot... surprisingly cold still... Despite that, I had a pretty nice sleep.

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613335,"Today I hiked with WrongWay, with him leading. We finally did the boardwalk we’d kept hearing about, which was beautiful. We have been walking on a couple boarded sections here and there, which has provided a great break from the mud. But this section was solid boardwalk for a mile or two, with a wooden suspension bridge in the middle. Really beautiful area with tall grasses. Black birds with red patches were perched atop some of these plants... reminded me of a similar looking bird back in Santa Cruz.
Stopped at Heaven Hill Farms and saw an outdated sign on the trail saying they had lunches and fruits, but was disappointed that they had neither. Instead I grabbed some junk food, some bakery items, and the highlight - some lemon New York italian ice. Should have had more of that!
After that we hiked up the “stairway to heaven” we’d heard about from the locals. I wanted to stop halfway for a break and refill at the stream, then we continued up for a great view of the valley we’d just hiked out of, including the little boardwalk we walked out of to get to Heaven Hill Farms.
Spent the night at Wawayanda Shelter with another thru hiker, didn’t quite get his name. He passed us on the way up and had already setup his tent near our shelter.

Neglected to read AWOL’s guide today and regretted it. Took a look at the Guthook app and the elevation gains didn’t look too crazy for the day. The note in AWOL said it’s deceiving, as there is bouldering around rocks, and sudden rises and drops...
Hiked with WrongWay again today. Early on we encountered my first real roadside trail magic - some folks setup with a tent and all sorts of goodies. I grabbed a beer, hot dog, and a donut. We chatted and found they were waiting for Frozen from a YouTube channel called Outdoor Adventures. We waited around a bit, hoping they would pass through, but eventually around noon decided to head back onto the trail.
We ran into another hiker who also grabbed the trail magic - a middle aged lady hiking with one arm bandaged up - she had broken it and taken a month off the trail, and now she was back... We ended up crossing paths a few times, since her pace was slower, but we took more breaks.
When we were all close together, we passed a day hiker heading southbound who looked trustworthy and told us the trail ahead was flat and not rocky at all. We all bought it and looked forward to the relief, after having climbed through rocks and boulders coming up to that point.
But the trail ahead was the section I neglected to read in AWOL’s guide... And we all ended up laughing and repeating the girl’s words “it’s flat” as we went steeply uphill, sometimes straight up rock walls. And “there’s no rocks” as we climbed up giant boulders. Like always, the trail seems to have been planned by a maniacal planner, or someone just randomly drawing lines on a map without any topographical information. On one occasion we climbed up a rebar ladder fixed right into the solid rock, a straight up climb that reminded me a lot of a similar one at Pinnacles National Park.
Damn practical jokers...
Made it to the side trail into Greenwood Lake, which followed a steep path downhill. We didn’t quite make it to the post office in time, so I figured I’d grab the package I mailed myself on Monday (the Post Office is closed Sundays).
Grabbed food and drinks at Murphy’s Tavern, where I tried Overpass IPA on tap, which was great and hit the spot.
Afterwards we took a Lyft to Warwick Motel, which turned out to be a bad decision. The motel was run down but kind of manageable, but the folks upstairs turned out to be some sort of drug addicts who vacuumed their floor constantly, pounded and yelled on their floor, and paced back and forth all night... I split the room with WrongWay, and he didn’t really sleep. I slept a few hours, but it was an overall bad experience... Stay out of room 103.","Wawayanda Shelter

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613341,"After a rough sleep at our motel, we checked out and walked around Warwick a bit in the rain. Checked out a beef jerky shop and chatted with the lady there about hiking in general - people always seem so impressed about the distances and the time on the trail, especially with WrongWay, who started January 2 in Georgia.
Grabbed a coffee and some food to go at Caffe a La Mode, then walked over to the Craft Beer Cellar, which had a lot of single bottled beers for sale in addition to 20 beers on tap. Here we ran into a nice couple who were curious about our hiking, and I didn’t realize it but the lady bought our first beers for us. I didn’t have a chance to thank her. I think that can also be considered trail magic! I have a lot of unbalanced trail magic karma that I desperately need to pay forward somehow...
It was around 3:30pm so we took a ride to get another town called Chester for a hotel that wasn’t booked up. For the same price as the motel last night, we have a wonderfully clean and modern room and no drug addicts pacing around upstairs... as always, always wonderful to experience joy after suffering.

WrongWay decided to stay an extra day, but I felt like I wanted to keep making progress, if even a few miles.
Took a Lyft back to Greenwood Lake to pick up my self-mailed package, then climbed back out of the city on the same blue blaze WrongWay and I took down a few days back.
Hiked up in the foggy morning before the rain started for the day. Made it to the Bellevue ice cream place I’d heard so much about, and had a great two scoop dessert - one with sorbet (which I was craving), and one with vanilla raspberry (?) which seemed to be popular.
Went back out into the light rain and aimed to get in just a few more miles to the next shelter. It was tough. There was a section called Pinnacles which involved rock climbing and then walking over a slippery rock face. I distrusted every single step, and was super thankful for my poles. There was a similar area up ahead called Cat Rocks, which were not as bad, but still very scary in the rain.

Everything eventually got soaked, and my feet were wet pretty much all day. I do think I went a little bit crazy. There were super muddy sections that I ended up gleefully stomping in like a little kid... maybe trying some of that old reverse psychology on the trail again, like I did to amuse myself and try to deal with the rocks. But it didn’t work...
Kind of bailed out and decided to go to the nearby Tuxedo Motel, which I thought was near the trail. But it was a 40 minute walk down the road, which I found out when I arrived at the road. My own bad planning, but I went kinda crazy in the pouring rain and let out a maniacal laugh that only I heard. But whatever... I waited for a Lyft and they dropped me off.

It was only Thursday, but I saw some full parking lots when entering Harriman State Park. Also ran into a few more folks than I expected, including a big hiking group (thanks for the snack bar!). I could tell this place is even more popular on the weekends.
Went through the Lemon Sweeze with my pack still on. Pretty easy. But the part immediately after was a rock climb straight up a rock. I found the foot placements and somehow dragged myself up. All the while being thankful it wasn’t raining and slippery...
Make it to Fingerboard Shelter for a break, but almost every entry in the logbook mentioned a problem bear that somehow got bear bags that were hung correctly - even the PCT hang?! Hound lost his bag this way according to the logs. I bunked with him way back at the secret shelter.
Chatted with a day hiker who was spending one night out here. Also saw a through hiker. We all decided to move on to the next shelter, William Brian, another five miles or so north.

It was a pretty hard day today, with three big uphill climbs. Guthook says it was about 2700ft ascent, 3400ft descent.
At the top of one of these was Bear Mountain, a very touristy area that had a few folks roaming around despite it being a Friday. Not a super great view today, but I took advantage of the vending machines - one which sold Pringles!
Back down the other side of the mountain on a really well maintained trail. Despite it being a large descent, it was super easy - just a series of rock steps! At the bottom of Bear Mountain Inn, where I had a hamburger and ice coffee at the Hiker Cafe, then had a fancy cheese plate with beer up at the bar. Local cheese and pretty local beer! I was super happy. Great morale booster. :)
Walked across a roll bridge and then hiked straight up the next mountain, till I arrived at a campsite just at sunset. I saw a few familiar faces from the previous shelter, including SlowDog.

Had a rude awakening... opened my tent and saw what I thought were beetles scatter. I took a closer look at one and realized it was... a cockroach?! There were three scurrying around out front. I was pretty angry, and started moving my bag and stuff away. As I put away my tent, there were a few more that had been resting under my tent pad. They scattered suddenly...
Very very late start, past noon today. I’m not sure what’s happening to me. Got hungry and cooked a little at the campsite, then hiked a very short distance to the Appalachian Mart, where I had a great sub sandwich, beer, and snacks. Best thing is that I saved one half of the sandwich for dinner!
Crossed the road and walked about a half mile to the Graymoor Spiritual Center. This is a Franciscan center that allows hikers to camp here on their baseball field. It was still early in the day, but I took a quick break and was feeling super tired... the whole area was quiet and peaceful, but since it was the weekend, I should have known better. About a half hour later, several groups showed up and started setting up camp.
I am not a social person... and now I have limited energy just to give to myself, and hardly someone else... I ended up putting my bag together and hiking into the complex to check out their bookstore. Bought a small book (extra weight! Oh no!) and got a ginger ale from the vending machine. Was interesting to see all the photos of the friars through the decades, and photos of the friars with popes in their various ages.
Took a little break outside on one of their many benches, and contemplated where to spend the night. I just didn’t have energy in me, so I resigned myself to the now-crowded baseball field.
Came back and even more folks were there - with cars driven onto the field even, and what turned out to be a huge church-related gathering near the shelter, where I was earlier.
But another unwelcome surprise came... as I took bags out of my pack, I spotted two hitchhiker roaches from last night’s campsite. I smashed them both and checked for more. This made me angry again... definitely not a challenge I thought I’d have to deal with.
Met another flip flopped here who was of course older and just-retired, called Soaring Eagle I think? He started April 17, ten days before me, which doesn’t really lift my spirits. He was also thinking of quitting early, despite the fact we’re almost 400 miles in now.
Aiming for a campsite tomorrow which will be just about 400 miles. Committed to going at least to mile 550, which is 25% of the AT.

It was a particularly hot day, so I made sure to keep super hydrated, but all my clothes got swampy and sweaty and gross. My face felt like it was sweaty all day really. I drank enough water and didn’t pee at all, which is a sign my body needed all it got... I didn’t eat enough though, and was feeling particularly exhausted.
As I neared the Canopus Lake area, the terrain got flat and easy, and my pace picked up - I was passing day hikers comfortably at a nice pace. I really though this was an easy trail coming from the lake for the day hikers, but I was wrong... the trail got more difficult and rocky towards the end of the day. Of course there were lots of gratuitous ups and downs. And the ups seemed pointless, leading not to some beautiful viewpoint or anything, but to... nothing. Then downhill again after that.
I was pushing myself to arrive before 5pm for a cafe by the beach, and I arrived just at 5pm and found it still closed for the season, with just Eagle Wings setup on the beach.

Stopped by RPH Shelter, which was super nice - with a garden and even lounge chairs. Took a quick snack break there and kind of regretted not spending the night. But the shower at the beach complex was well worth it, I decided, no matter how alluring the RPH Shelter was.
Hiked on to a road crossing. Only a half mile detour promised to take me to a market-deli and a pizza place, and it was well worth it. At the pizza place I ran into the Adventure Boys, two guys hiking together. Turns out they had also camped at the beach, except in the proper camping area which Eagle Wings and I couldn’t manage to find.
While there, a crazy strong thunderstorm passed through the area, first turning the sky dark, and then belting out a huge amount of water into the area. I checked the weather app on my phone and got a kick out of the fact that the area was called Stormville.
The rest of the day was dry luckily, and cool. Hiked on to Morgan Stewart Shelter, where the Adventure Boys and Eagle Wings were already waiting.

I was initially thinking of hiking 10 miles and then taking a road into town via Lyft, but there was a much closer way to get into town via highway 55, and I ended up calling up a Lyft and getting into town around lunchtime. 
Looked like a pretty nice trail town. Went to the Tap House Tavern for a lunch. Food was alright, nothing special, but they had a lot of beers on tap, so I tried two. Definitely hit the spot after hiking, if even just hiking a few lazy miles...
Checked out the bookstore and for some reason ended up buying yet another small book - Leaves Of Grass.
There was a fancy bakery attached to a nice restaurant that had an impossibly large crowd for a Tuesday afternoon. Not just old retired folks, which I could expect, but folks of all ages. It was pretty swarming there - I really can’t imagine how busy it must be on the weekends!
Checked in to Station Inn, which was super nice, and a bit of a splurge for this trip. I booked on Expedia, but should have called and asked for the hiker discount... interesting guesthouse with no front desk, just an automated keyed entry system.
The place was super clean and the bed super comfy, with really soft linens. I tried not to dirty it up too much...

He said when he hiked, he kept his pack weight down decently, but had to make a lot of his stuff from scratch to keep things light. He was jealous of the amount of information we have access to these days about the AT.
Right after this there was a train stop right by the tracks. The train stops on the weekends and will take folks to and from NYC! The thru hiker said there are all sorts of interesting folks who arrive from the city, dressed inappropriately for a day of hiking...

Passed through the Wiley Shelter and waited for some rain to pass through. There were folks setup with tents, and I saw them pass by but they didn’t say hi.

In the morning I had the option to head into Kent, but I had already left somewhat late, and still felt satisfied from the last trail town, so I pressed on.
Went up Caleb’s Peak and saw a bear. The bear actually saw me before I saw it. Before I knew what was happening, that bear had turned around and started scrambling away like mad. It seemed to be right on the trail, and I hoped it wasn’t running further up the trail I needed to pass through. Luckily that was the last I saw of it.
Made it to the top and saw three hikers, two older ladies and one older man who sort of scrunched up his face at me and seemed to not like me from the get-go. We chatted a bit, then I headed off. The scrunchy face man started mumbling something like “He didn’t even stop to enjoy the view” just as I was heading down the rocks a bit to get a more unobstructed view to stop and photograph. Just as I did so, he groaned a bit as a ladies laughed at him for his impatient remark.
Later in the day I came close to Cornwall with lots of time to spare, so I walked in for some food. Found a liquor store there that gives hikers a free beer for signing their logbook, which was nice!
Went to the market - the deli was closed, but they had bagged sandwiches to go. I splurged and got a sandwich and tons of snacks to eat on their porch while I charged my phone and used their WiFi. Grateful for these hiker friendly places!
Hiked a bit more till I got to Caesar Brook Campground. It was after sunset, and I struggled with the lack of light. I was already using my flashlight during the last part of the hike, and I shined it around and spotted a hammock camper - probably Slow Dog? There was also a huge tent with a big campfire. I found a spot to setup and tried unsuccessfully to hang my bear bag, so I kind of gave up and set the bag by my tent.
Later on, another hiker came right by my tent for some reason, then laughed, probably at the bear bag that was just laying there. Soon after I heard what turned out to be a Bear Box closing. A bear box at just a campground, not even a shelter?! Connecticut is wonderful.

Packed up my stuff slowly. It’s always fun to see all my stuff start spread out everywhere, and slowly make its way in its compact travel form in my bag.

Thought it was a long shot because it was Memorial Day weekend, but this is a hiker hostel and had bunks available thankfully! Also, I think I am still above the Flip Flip bubble. Though I seem to be seeing more and more hikers around in general...
Hiked some more until I reached highway 7, where Hudson picked me up. He has been running the nearby Bearded Woods Hostel in addition to a shuttle service. The hostel was super clean and at a really comfortable cold temperature - just walking around there felt like I was drinking a cool drink to ward off the day’s heat.
Saw Sharon, the LASH (long ass section hike), as well as Eagle Wings and his wife. Hudson also ordered Mexican, so I tagged along on the order and got a steak burrito and nachos. It was ok... I think I have been spoiled by knowing good Mexican food.
Sleep in a bed was wonderful... that was a nice end to a hot day.","Caesar Brook Campground

There was rain in the schedule for the afternoon, so I did a short day and went to just the first shelter. This one was infamous for having a pretty steep decline to get to it. It was steep! But I managed, and knew the uphill coming back the next morning would have surer footing. 
A younger section hiker came in a bit later. He was a smoker and offered me weed. Getting tired of these smokers on the trail, but I thanked him and declined anyhow. We both kinda were taking a nap when three brothers showed up. They were out for a few days’ hike, and brought all the random useless gear that comes with them: a big knife, big bulky army compass, etc.
A through hiker from Germany came in later, and we all managed to cram in like sardines. Six of us in the shelter, and not a great restful sleep that night. The guy next to me had a whoopie cushion for a face. I also rolled over and found myself with no space to stretch my arms... really I would have had more space in my tent.

 Went up another Bear Mountain - this one in CT. Then went up Mount Race.
Ran into Quill, an older lady who was an artist. She is one of the few folks who I actually outpaced on the trail. She would end up arriving at the same campsite that night and we both tented on the tent footpads.
I cooked dinner and ate while it was starting to rain again. Luckily I had the tent all setup and ready, but not staked down, which wasn’t smart. The rain fly not being staked meant it got a little wet inside the tent...","Limestone Spring Shelter

Worked my way finally into MA. The bugs were pretty bad in sections. The mosquitos overwhelmed me in a hemlock forest section. They were so huge and slow - I could feel them land on me, and I was fast enough that I could smack them. But it got to be so constant that I dropped my pack and scrambled to find my Picaridin, which I literally applied to my exposed skin. The mosquitos tried to stick around, but at least they were no longer attempting landing operations. I returned to my pack and could see a bunch of mosquitos were relaxing on it... pretty bad.
Tried to Lyft and Uber for a ride at US 7, both unsuccessfully. My backup plan was to call Joe the shuttle driver, who accepted only donations. He said he’d arrive in ten minutes, so I went inside an antique store and bought two sodas, one to drink while I waited outside.
Joe brought me to Days Inn and took my photo to post on his Instagram account (@jwsnma). He also took down a lot of stats like the type of hike I was doing, my start date, some gear questions. Apparently he maintained a spreadsheet with this data.
Checked in, got a few coffees from reception, and rested a little before heading out later to try a restaurant (The Well) and the local SoCo Creamery for ice cream.","Race Brook Falls Campsite

Visited a French bakery, Bazilions, owned by a French guy who was very hiker friendly. He even gave me a free croissant, so I felt obliged to buy something else - it looked like a biscotti (singular?) but was called something else.

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615825,"Checked out of the hotel right at 11am, then walked to downtown Great Barrington. There was a farmers market going on, but I didn’t check it out. Ended up heading the post office to grab the small package I have been mailing to myself - with liquid refills mainly. Decided to dump all the contents into my pack and broke down the box. This gives me a lot more freedom, as I don’t need to make sure I make it to the Post Office at the right hours in the next town. Also not sure exactly where I’ll be staying the night before my flight. 
I’ll be heading back to CA to help my folks move cross country. Finally figured out that Albany airport in NY is a good nearby place to fly out of (and hopefully fly back to, to resume my hike).
Got a sandwich from a market downtown and ate it on a bench nearby. The Saturday crowds were buzzing around in all their yuppiness and I felt like an alien. Ready to get out...
Joe the shuttle driver picked me up nearby the post office around noon. I heard him say “Philosopher!” from the side parking lot, and I jumped in. He dropped me off right where I left off, and by luck there was a pair of hikers coming up the path just then who he’d been in contact with. They needed a ride into town, and he was there instantly to provide it!
Tom Leonard shelter was less than ten miles in, and I felt no desire to go longer than that today, plus there was the ever-looming thunderstorm ready to pounce sometime that afternoon.
Was already starting to feel a bit tired... now I know why folks like to do a lot of hiking in the mornings, before they have to deal with the after lunch lethargy.
This is an awesome bunk and loft style shelter with plenty of room. I grabbed a bunk and was happy to have space, and no whoopie cushion face storing directly into my ears. Turned in early for the night without really talking to anyone. Getting a bit burned out by most social interaction these days, and the egos bragging about their big miles for the day.

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615826,"The other thru hiker got up and left before dawn, as I kind of expected. Although I can’t blame him wanting to get an early start, as the latter half of the day was supposed to be filled with thunderstorms. 
I slept in a bit and left around 7:30am, which is pretty good time for me.
Fairly easy today, although the total altitude gain was 2k+, which is a pretty standard day. No crazy rock scrambling or rock climbing thankfully. I keep wishing I had enrolled in some sort of basic climbing class at REI or elsewhere...
Made it to The Ledges view, which looked back south where I came from, with Mt Everett in the distance dominating the other hills... mountains. I got the urge for some coffee, so I boiled up some water right there. I wish I did that more often, aka stopping and smelling the roses. Liked that much more than just cooking up coffee at the shelter.
Passed a beaver bog and saw a beaver for the first time! It was also the result of pausing for just a few minutes and appreciating the nice pond. Even got some video of him going past me, doing a little scouting swim to figure out what the humans were up to now.
Got into camp and saw familiar faces - the father and his adult daughter (who offered us weed and whisky, both which I declined), the older man Jersey who was not yet retired, but was thinking of doing a Flip Flop when he eventually does.
This whole campsite is called Shaker campsite, and for a reason - the Shaker community had some settlements here and in the surrounding area. This particular campsite had some old farming equipment and a stone foundation for what was apparently a barn. There were some pretty old tall trees growing up right where the barn would be, all newer than that foundation obviously. Lots of history there.
I setup my tent at the top of this foundation, where there was a nice flat spot. Settled in a bit early - the thunderstorm finally arrived soon after. Not too bad, but the creaking and groaning of trees made me nervous, and I realized I forgot to check for “widow maker” branches above. Oh well, I thought... if a branch came down and killed me, it was fate (and of course not due to my own laziness).","Tom Leonard Shelter
",Shaker Campsite,"Jun 02, Sun",11.30
Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615828,"There was a thunderstorm with rain overnight, and thankfully everything dried up by the morning. I was very lazy today and slept in... by the time I left my tent, the rest of the camp was packed up and gone already. So I enjoyed having the place to myself a bit! 
Signed the logbook and found a laminated sheet of history about the Shaker community in the area. Interesting folks. The caretaker at the Upper Goose Pond Cabin (my destination for the day) said there are still a few Shakers around apparently, but they are now quite old.
Not far of a hike from camp was Jerusalem Road, where there was a sign directing hikers to a Trail Stand. Farmers in these small communities have a great honor system where they place their eggs out for their neighbors along the roadside - this was a souped up version of that. A shack with power running to it, with a mini fridge with all sorts of goodies: Pepsi’s (with real sugar!), Mountain Dew, Gatorade, candies, pop tarts, chips, chips ahoy. All sorts of great hiker junk food! I grabbed two sodas and some Fritos, and left the suggested amount of money for each in a little red pouch that was provided for folks, all on the honor system.
I have been seeing more and more hikers lately, and true to that trend two more hikers came by the stand as I was sitting there. One with a green beard and a kilt. We never exchanged names, but he did tell me that he woke up at 4:30am that morning and had already done 12 miles, and it wasn’t even noon yet. I hate those sorts of conversations, they only seem to be for ego stroking. I told him I woke up late and had only done about 2 miles so far. I suppose there was nothing impressive in that, so he never asked me my name. Getting tired of these sorts of stupid interactions that drain energy and only serve to prop up egos. I suppose I need to figure out a better way at handling it... better attitude on my part.
Soon after that, the AT crossed over a barbed wire fence, straight into a pasture with a bunch of brown cows. I was taking photos and videos of them when they meandered closer to the path I was supposed to cross up ahead. Doh! Tried to walk past them as docile and gently as possibly, saying a gentle “hi cows” and even waving to them as I walked past slowly. Success!
The entire day had perfect weather. The sun was out, but there was a nice chill in the air still which was perfect for hiking. The bugs also weren’t so bad all day, though I did swat a few away.
The trail the last few days has been pretty tame, but I have been doing pretty low miles. I looked at the remaining miles till my 25% mark and realized it’s much closer than I thought... meaning I don’t need to kill myself getting miles in each day. And the shelters and campsites are spaced about 10 miles apart, which is just about the amount of miles I need to get in for each day I have left before my flight back to LA. Perfect. An even more relaxed pace than what I’ve been doing.
Arrived at Upper Goose Pond Cabin in the evening, a great big red cabin with a nervous dog barking at all the hikers. Apparently she was a rescue dog and is still getting used to the environment - the constant influx of unfamiliar faces each day must be pretty confusing for her.
I picked out a bunk - a big dark room with pads underneath each bunk. Great! Somehow it was only 6pm and people were already sleeping, so I tried my best not to wake them.
Cooked up a Mountain House chicken teriyaki and then called it a night.","Shaker Campsite
",Upper Goose Pond Cabin,"Jun 03, Mon",10
Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615829,"Late start today - hung around the cabin too long. In the morning the caretaker made real coffee with pancakes (limit three per person) for free at 6:30am. Most folks were awake and ready for food, but I lingered around my bunk till I was the last one in the room. 
Spent some of the morning catching up on journal entries, which kind of used a lot of battery power. I’d find myself running unusually low on power in the coming days.
Jersey and the caretaker took a canoe out on the pond to get to a spring, and refill a bunch of the big water bottles at the cabin (a better water source than the actual pond water).
Left past 10am and the “guard dog” was still barking at me as I was walking around taking photos of the place.
Headed back on the trail - the half mile blue blaze seemed to go by super fast, way faster than when I was going the opposite direction in anticipation of finally reaching the cabin.
Right at the intersection of the AT and the blue blaze I saw Jersey, who told me he spent some extra time sitting on a rock and enjoying the area. No rush for either of us today, we were both heading to the same shelter - another sub ten mile day.
I let him go ahead, since he had a faster pace. A while later he had gone too far ahead for me to see him. And maybe not 15 minutes after that I suddenly came across him sitting on the ground in front of me with a bewildered look on his face. Turns out he took his first fall, and banged up his elbow. He was a bit stunned and was taking it in, and I wasn’t sure what to do. There was no blood and he told me he was ok, and I got the sense he wanted to be alone a bit to take it in, or just for some privacy... so I let him go.
I thought it was kind of weird for him to fall on a dry day, when it wasn’t even raining! I think times like these give us a subconscious ego boost - “at least I’m doing better than him!”. Of course some miles after this I would have my first dry day fall, falling face forward - what would have been a face plant, but my face never touched the ground luckily. My poor left knee took the brunt of it. Now both knees had taken the force of my stupid falls, the tear in the right pant leg telling the story of one of the falls to everyone.
I pushed on a bit more and enjoyed what turned out to be another pretty great day. There was supposed to be another thunderstorm of course, but it wouldn’t arrive until that evening.
Jersey passed me up while I was relaxing by a spring, and I met him and his friend up ahead at the shelter. His hiker friend had delivered him a resupply, including cold beer on ice! Super nice... lucky him.
His hiker friend had hiked the entirety of the AT just last year - and I was really surprised she was out hiking now, and wasn’t sick of it by now.
Both the bottom bunks were taken (I think she setup a spot for another friend who would arrive later that evening). I checked out the upper bunks and the upper loft (which seems like a Massachusetts style shelter innovation). I think I could get up on either of them, but I was afraid of rolling down one of them in the middle of the night. Setup a tent instead, which was great. Love being able to have my little private retreat to go to.
The rain did revisit us that evening, but thankfully everything was dry by morning. Had a pretty restless sleep despite inflating the air mattress. I could hear small animals dancing around outside the tent and even urinating nearby... finally decided to be done with it and put my earplugs in for the night....","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615830,"This day I wanted to push into the town of Dalton by lunch. That was the plan anyway. I left just before 8am, which for me was pretty good time... meant that I should reach Dalton by 1pm even at a super slow pace. But I wouldn’t arrive till around 2:30pm... 
It was supposed to be a pretty easy day, with a really flat trail profile.. maybe 1k elevation gain for the whole day, the whole 11 or so miles into town. But I struggled and slogged. I think it was due to the poor sleep from the night before, but I was seriously considering it may be a tick related disease. Or maybe just lethargy... both knees were only semi functional now... refusing to bend far enough to be able to squat (for those times that involve digging cat holes), and aching more than usual for the few uphill slogs of the day.
During the hike I got passed up first by Jersey’s friends, then by Jersey himself. We have been leapfrogging each other like this for the past few days. He and his friend were going to stop for lunch at the Kay Wood Shelter. That was the last I saw of them.
Sat down a few times to snack and drink some water, but despite that I was feeling dizzy again. Not a good sign... another symptom of a tick related disease?
Made it in to Dalton finally. The AT goes right through town here, just like it did in Duncannon, PA. I was dutifully following the white blazes painted through the neighborhood when I heard “Philosophy! Err... Philosopher!” It was the clean guy with perfect eyebrows, sitting with his friend of the porch of what turned out to be Tom Levardi - a Trail angel. He offered me a soda, but I passed - I was looking forward to a drink on tap, and some town food!
Unfortunately the pub was closed, so I headed to Angelina’s Sub Shop. They were super kind and hiker friendly - I left my pack outside and ordered a cheese steak sandwich with A1 sauce and mayo. They offered to fill up my water but I declined... today I am getting off the trail.
Wandered around a bit looking for a place that carried picture postcards, but I never could find anything. I also had no luck in Albany. I guess the days of picture postcards are over?
Tried to figure out the local bus system, but I gave up after the bus didn’t arrive in 10 minutes. Of course it passed by in a whirlwind after some 15 minutes, by which time I’d requested a Lyft to take me to the Greyhound station in nearby Pittsfield. This station and its shady characters were my brutal reverse culture shock, my reintroduction into the land of miserable people. Totally different attitudes out here.
Got to Red Roof Inn in Albany and called it a night... was happy skipping dinner since it was late and I was still full from the big sub sandwich I had at lunch.
This is it for the time being. Dalton is roughly 550 miles from Harper’s Ferry, and that marks 1/4 of the total miles on the Appalachian Trail. A pretty nice spot to take a break, exit the trail, and hopefully reenter it soon. I am flying back to LA to help with some family obligations, and it gives me a good excuse to at least recoup a bit. I hope my knees have time to finally recover, more than a single zero day could offer them. I hope to return to the trail in a few weeks. I am already thinking about it, and I’m particularly eager to see what all the hubbub is about the Whites and the infamous Rocky Mountains further up.","October Mountain Shelter

This month has passed very fast - I helped my parents move cross country, I saw my sister and her family, I experienced a 115F degree southern heat (while we were unloading the truck...). I was even able to experience the first day of the Barnes and Noble Criterion sale... 
Most importantly in terms of the trail, I have also given my knees a chance to recover. Also started taking Glucosamine supplements to help the knees rebuild. I think my knees were the things slowing me down in the previous few days on the trail. The downhills have been hard and I’ve been dreading them, particularly in the rains...
Despite the slow recovery of my knees, I have been genuinely motivated to get back on the trail, and I’m glad for that. I want to see what’s coming up ahead. All through this hike I have been hearing about how beautiful the Whites are, and equally how challenging they are. I want to see what the 100 mile wilderness is about. I want to experience hiking up Kadahdin. I want to see just how muddy Vermont (“Vermud”) is. I want to discover some more fun trail towns and see what they have to offer.
After hiking 1/4 of the trail I’ve also realized how quickly it passes. I had hoped to figure out some more plans for the future along the way, but all I have are a few scraps of insights which are rattling around my brain. I need to take more time to write and sort things out.
Tomorrow I fly out of Charleston, South Carolina and fly back to Albany, New York.

Had breakfast at Econolodge and while I ate I saw a Thomas the Tank engine rideable toy that my nieces have... a little reminder that I am once again far away and on my own for a while.
Left Econolodge and couldn’t find a Lyft, so I decided to walk into Dalton. I thought this would be a nice warmup for my legs, but probably contributed to overdoing it on the first day back on the trail in a month...
Again felt the anxiety of walking around these car towns with no pedestrians in sight. You start to feel weird for being the only one walking around...
Soon made it back to Dalton and into familiar territory where I last left off.
Went back into the woods and loved hearing the bird song that I had missed.
Pushed on harder and faster than I should have today. I felt like my legs were ready, but soon felt some killer pain in my knees when descending. I had thought my knees were almost fully healed, and was more disappointed than anything. My legs were also shaking somewhat, which wasn’t a good sign. I thought I would have to quit immediately, even though my mind wanted to continue, which is a terrible place to by in...
What I realized in the following days was that I had simply packed too much stuff, especially food, and had not shipped some of it ahead. I had also failed to do any sort of stretches or massaging to stretch out my IT band. Seems to be a common injury.
So slowly I descended down the mountain, and hobbled into town in pain. The ice cream shop was closed, but I enjoyed their picnic benches for a quick rest.
Soon I hobbled to St Mary’s of the Assumption, a church that welcomes hikers to use their lawn. I was surprised I was the only one there that night. Not too bad... some road noise, but Cheshire was way more sleepy than Dalton or Pittsfield, so it worked out nice.","Econolodge Pittsfield

Continued to see many hikers, including day hikers that had probably taken some time off for Fourth of July.

Woke up at a comfortable time and found the folks in the upper bunks had left already. But there were still some folks around, including the caretaker. Took my leisurely time to enjoy the morning and make some breakfast - biscuits and gravy with coffee!
When leaving the shelter I grabbed my hiking poles which were propped by the side of the shelter (sort of a way of letting approaching folks know you’re inside) and had to tear it loose from a fresh cobweb, which crumbled and withered. Sorry spider! The spider seemed to get back to work weaving his web...
Soon after leaving, I saw a porcupine up on the trail ahead. He saw me as well, and decided the best path of escape was to follow the AT north. I kept pausing to give him some room, and could see him stopping on the trail ahead and turning his head back cautiously. This happened a few more times for maybe 0.2 miles till he gave up and decided to climb a tree. Got some good video of that!
Enjoyed walking through some pines with a sweet sugary smell, which oddly reminded me of some pine smells from summer day camps about thirty years back now...
Made it to Wilbur Clearing Shelter and saw the ridge runner there again (named Saw Dog?). Also saw a bunch of tents from a trail crew. Chatted with Saw Dog a bit and he sort of convinced me to keep going. It was maybe too soon for a hotel stay, but that’s how the timing worked out, so I booked a place in town.
Walked over to the Stop N Shop and loaded up on salad, pluots, drinks, and some cheese and salami snack. Dinner! Then walked another long distance to the hotel and begged out. Good bed but just ok hotel.

Slow start from the hotel as I planned. Missed breakfast but had coffee. Took a while to warm up muscles - was worried about them at first, but then they started to feel more normal.
Walked into town and got some food at Spring Street Market and Cafe. The whole place was bustling and busy. The town had more of a touristy vibe to it than anything. It was ok.
Lucked out and found an Uber nearby. First one I had seen after looking for two days. He had just dropped off another AT hiker.
Trail was really lovely, following a stream a long ways, which cooled down the whole area. Today it was expected to reach 90 degrees F but I never really felt too hot or humid like I did in previous days. The cool breeze helped.
Pete’s Spring was really awesome - a true spring with water bubbling up out of the ground. Watched the sand dance around a while where hidden natural openings piped up pure water. Every now and then some air bubbles would seem to also come up from random places. Reminded me of some place from my past where we got water from a natural soda spring.
Crossed into Vermont and helped take a photo of a friendly three person group flip flopping like me.
The mud the last few days hasn’t been too bad, and a bit dried out if anything. But true to Vermont’s reputation, the bad mud started soon after.
Made it to the campsite, found a tent site across from the shelter, and immediately went to task trying to hang up my bear bag. Haven’t done this for a while - with the one month off and even before that, with every campsite and shelter in CT and MA providing a bear box. Not this time! Every state brings its own style...
Tried forever for a pretty ideal branch, but ended up snagging on something nearby that was the next best thing. I did the PCT style and even pulled the bag away from the trees further and tied it off. I hope it’s still there in the morning.","Howard Johnson Williamstown

Woke up refreshed but it was already quite muggy inside the tent. A whole ecosystem had started to develop under the rain tarp: many small flies which had gotten trapped up at the top (and one large fly), and several spiders which had built webs below them, hoping for them to wander in.
By the time I got out of the tent, the folks from the nearby shelter had already moved out, so I decided to move camp over there for breakfast. Noticed one other tent with a late riser, which I’d later find out was Cocoa.
I knew it was going to rain today, but was frustrated because I haven’t had good phone reception for a while, not even on the tops of mountains. I hope Verizon has better coverage farther in.
The first part of the day was a notorious uphill slog, and the head and super humidity made it harder. But I felt a slight breeze which made it not too bad. By the time I made it to the top and to some powerlines, the breeze passing through there was too wonderful to resist. I sat down for a snack and a break and looked down at the powerlines stretching into the distance. Unbuttoned my shirt and let the breeze air it out. The sweat weighing it down felt like it was just dipped in a bucket of water...
Trudged on and managed to get barely enough reception to get a weather update. Chance of showers starting around 2pm.
But by the time I made it to the beaver outlet, I noticed increasing drops of water starting to impact and ripple in the pond. Doh! Soon it turned into a hard downpour and I scrambled to put my pack cover on. Also swapped out my sun hat for my rain hat - my “Seattle sombrero”. The downpour was bad and I waited it out a bit under my umbrella, till it turned to a lighter rain. And with that I was hiking again...
Hiked on and the rain picked up yet again. I hid under some trees with my umbrella and contemplated setting up camp there, but I had to remind myself that I needed water.
What looked like a dad and his son passed by... the son didn’t look too thrilled. Guessing it was dad’s idea to hike in the downpour...
Sure enough the rain let up again, so I made more progress. Soon the rain stopped altogether, and the sun came out again. Passed a work crew that was working to maintain the trail.
Got to another pond area where I could see almost 360 degrees all around, and the clouds looked ok and not dark and imposing. Maybe the forecast could have changed? I didn’t like not being able to check, out of range of reception again.
Made it to Congdon Shelter maybe around 4pm and saw Cocoa there. He was taking a lunch break. I was beat - so I planned to just stop there. Also to play it safe with the weather. Sure enough, soon the sky became dark and imposing, and the rain followed soon after. Not long after that, Wing It showed up - he was waiting for another hiker who was going to split a hotel bill with him.
After a while I think he gave up and was starting to settle in, but sure enough after maybe an hour or so, an older man with a southern accent showed up absolutely soaked. He did not look happy. The entire left side of his body was covered in mud, the undeniable evidence of a bad fall. Hiking in the rain makes those kind of falls possible...
I don’t know why, but I couldn’t take my eyes off of him, I just kept staring and was amazed and his tenacity. Crazy enough, he wanted to keep the original plan of hiking 3 more miles and splitting the hotel bill, so the younger guy agreed. The older man knew he was going slower, so he left first, then Wing It, the younger guy, staggered his departure and trailed after him maybe a half hour later.
A couple arrived at the shelter soon after, and I had a couple of unsuccessful rounds trying to hang up my bear bag while preparing for dinner and sleep. Third time’s the charm - on that third trip out, I finally found a good rock and launched it over my choice branch. Good to get in more throwing practice for sure!
The sky got darker and darker, and no one else seemed to show up by the time of writing, around 8:30pm. Guessing some hardcore hikers may arrive later after dark.","Seth Warner Shelter

Not a lot of notes for this day. The weather became wonderful, cool air with a breeze and not so much humidity.
The trail descended sharply down rock steps to Bennington, then rose sharply again to get out of the gap. Same old pattern I’m used to by now.
Saw one garter snake on the trail.
Got to Goddard Shelter and was happy to find a new bear box in place. They have been having bear issues around the area, but at least I didn’t have to hang up my bag!
Setup my tent near the shelter and called it a night. I definitely get more relaxing sleep out in my tent, not having to be self-conscious about my snoring. But maybe I setup too close to the shelter itself, as I could hear snoring from there soon (I think it was Lost and Found, who I met later).
I really pushed myself this day and was proud I could do it. A decent number of miles with a LOT of elevation gain. Gained back a lot of confidence today. Bit change after getting depressed on the first day back, thinking I would have to fly back home soon because of my knees.","Congdon Shelter

Stopped into Kid Gore Shelter for a quick breakfast break and saw a trio of trail flip flopper folks I’d run into before at the Vermont border: Mercury, Houdini, and Everview (wearing a kilt).
That shelter had a nice break in the trees which provided a rare viewpoint. These Green Mountains have been mostly a tunnel of green, and if you want a view, most of the time that simply means having to climb up one of the fire towers along the trail.
Another benefit of these mountains is that they are quite remote. You can walk through the forest and only hear nature, and the occasional passenger airplane soaring above. On most of the trail south of here the AT follows only a thin corridor, meaning that non-nature surrounds you on both sides. Along with all its sounds: traffic and farm equipment mostly. Sometimes the endless sound of truck backup signals, beeping endlessly as you make your slow descent down some mountain. But the Green Mountains had none of this. Kind of an exciting feeling being so remote for once.
Passed by a bog which had pitcher plants in bloom on the side. A lady doing the Long Trail pointed them out to me.
Took a break at Story Spring Shelter, which looked already busy. I probably would have stayed, but I really wanted to get to town in the next few days, so I was eager to make more progress and get more miles done, even if it meant stealth camping. Which I did.
Found an ok site, not near water, but just at the base of Stratton Mountain, which I definitely didn’t want to ascend this day. Looked all around and was scouting out a place for my tent and bear bag when I spotted two black bears moving in the distance. I let myself be known and they sort of took notice and then meandered on up the mountain. Quite a dilemma then - if I stayed I know my bag might get snagged by a bear. If I proceeded up the mountain I would probably run into the bears ago - in the dark...
Though I barely had food left, I protected what was left of it and took extra time to find a good hang. Took me a long time, and I got it just as light was seriously starting to fade. Had just enough time to then setup my tent with the remaining light.
Heard some funky animal screams which must have been coyotes, and probably didn’t have the greatest sleep that night. But I got through unscathed...","Goddard Shelter

Was happy to split the miles between today and yesterday. It means that town was coming up just one day away!
Hiked up Stratton Mountain and made it to the summit, where a caretaker and house were stationed. She was nice and gave some good tips, but had some outdated info about the water sources nearby. I think she came up the mountain on the gondola and never passed those water sources!
Tried to climb up the lookout tower, but I chickened out after only about the second or third level, where I had a decent enough view anyhow. I was shaking so much and probably got some terrible video up there.
Stopped in at Stratton Pond Shelter, which was one of Vermont’s overnight few shelters ($5). It was super sizable and nice, but I just used the privy and rested there a bit with Lost and Found, who was taking a late lunch break. We both took a nap, and he started snoring loud. This had to be him at the previous shelters!
Kept pushing on and finally got to Spruce Peak Shelter, a rare four-walled shelter. It even had an old fashioned wood stove inside, the first time I’ve seen that!
Also at the shelter was an older lady from Ohio, originally Mississippi, with purple hair, and the couple who were from Switzerland (I originally thought they were Dutch for some reason).
Also met Stick Man, a very skinny older man who looked like a Hippie Gandalf. He had been there for 3 days because of some knee issues (the back of his knee) and wasn’t sure if he should move forward or not, not wanting to be a burden to others and have to call in a rescue party or something.

Got up earlier than usual to go into town! Walked just a bit to a trailhead parking area where it was supposedly easy to hitchhike. Increasingly there are no Lyft or Uber drivers around, and one of the local shuttle drivers was too busy at the time I was there, so I gave hitchhiking a go. After about 20-30 minutes I just sort of gave up and sat down on the grass, just about to call the shuttle driver again as a last resort.
Right then from the other direction came John (trailname Snail) with his black dog on his lap in his truck. He asked if I was heading to town, and he did a U turn to pick me up. He was a friendly guy, a retired professor from Atlanta. I mentioned my folks moving to South Carolina and he was sort of surprised - said he had experience with them being very backwards and racist there.

Left the hostel around noon after some chat and waiting out the rain showers. The owner told me of a shortcut back to the trail via a snowmobile route. Go up, take a left at the fork, then take a right at the next fork, then when you come to the two bridges, the one of the right is the AT. All well and good but I took a wrong fork into what apparently wasn’t a trail. Got in too deep to back out and ended up bushwhacking my way back to the AT, stepping in plenty of that famous Vermont mud. I also managed to step in some sort of tree stump or deep hole of some kind... my left leg fell into mud up to my knee, and I immediately recoiled and pulled it out.
Eventually found the AT again, which was such an obvious well-worn trail. Thankful for how maintained it is... way better than bushwhacking obviously.
While going uphill on one of the climbs I heard some noise in the bushes on the left, and the sound of some big twigs cracking as loud as bottle caps. I stopped but couldn’t see a thing. A man and his dog behind me stopped way back as well, and I never saw them again... hopefully they simply turned back. But I had to keep going forward towards the shelter, banging my sticks together judiciously more than usual to alert bears of my presence.
Peru Peak shelter was an old CCC built shelter right next to a roaring stream with a bridge over it. You could definitely smell that old oily tar smell that old bridges have.
At the shelter was just one other hiker, a southbound Long Trail hiker named Old School, because he was using an old style framed backpack. He said he had hiked the AT in 1980, almost 40 years ago now...
He ended up being super chatty and nosy, looking at every single thing I was doing and asking about gear and all sorts of things. I guess he was looking to get ideas for gear purchases. He was even commenting when I slipped my hands into my food bag to grab a mint. Just too much, man...
I setup my tent on the tent bed, and a trail maintainer came by in the evening to collect the $5 fee needed at a few select sites here in Vermont. I received a little card that I could show at the next place to waive the fee, should I choose to stay there.

Not a lot of notes from today. Saw a tiny garter snake on the trail. No other interesting wildlife encounters for today.
I broke up the day pretty well with some nice breaks that kept me going forward.
Made it though some weird rock piles that I honestly don’t really like. These manmade cairns end up cluttering the landscape. They are not natural. I didn’t want to take a photo there. But there was someone posing for their boyfriend in front of the rocks of course... guess that’s going on Instagram.
Another thru hiker passed me up, but he stopped for water and I passed him up. We were all getting close to the shelter, so I guess I was worried about not getting a tent spot.. I picked up my pace and stayed ahead of all three. They arrived maybe just 60 seconds after I got to camp, all three in a row. Here comes the cavalry! It was crowded but we all found spots luckily.
There were a few fireworks shows around 9pm, no idea where or why. Fourth of July was more than a week back, right?
Pretty sure I heard some animals walking around at night. Heard something that sounded like a dog growling, but I don’t think any hikers had dogs that night.

Last night I heard some probable animal noises, some growling, and a random scream that sounded like a woman, but was maybe some coyote? Or maybe just a hiker waking from a bad dream?? 
Got a little rain overnight but it was pretty dry by morning. I overheard someone in the morning complaining about the steep hike to get the almost-dried-up water source. When I left in the morning I was surprisingly not the last one out - the mother-daughter hikers (Madre and ??) we’re still setup.
I knew this was going to be a tough day with some pretty steep altitude gains, and the shelter I was shooting for about 15 miles away was a pretty lofty goal. It would have gotten me part way up Mt Killington to around 2k feet.
Initially I was aiming for lunch at a deli, but I realized it was closed. Found another place also about a 20 minute walk - a breakfast and lunch spot at Rutland airport. But while hiking closer and closer I decided it would be better to keep working through the food in my still heavy food bag, so I arrived at Minerva Hinchey Shelter to cook up a meal. Some time later 4 more hikers showed up, including the mother-daughter duo. There was a quick rain shower that came through later.
Took a quick nap there - I think skipping a cooked breakfast was my downfall today.
The descent down to VT 103 was pretty steep. This is the type of trail with large boulders and roots that I especially hate in the rain. It was thankfully very dry. And as always the descent seemed so close, and the noises from the highway deceivingly nearby.
Crossed over the road and there was a pretty serious steep rocky climb up. Unfortunately damp and wet, but with a lot of good footholds. A lot of this has become a game of trying to find the ideal footholds and foot placement, which is especially critical on downhills (errors there lead to falls...).
Got to Clarendon Shelter and called it quits there, 6 miles short of my target shelter. Felt it would be better to get plenty of rest before tomorrow.
I kind of passed out on a tent site under the trees for a bit, and the other folks at the shelter were a bit dismayed that they had a weird guy here to deal with.
Wonderful strong and icy cold stream goes right by the campsite. There are a ton of folks here tonight around the fire - definitely a bubble of sorts. Mostly younger folks who somehow have energy to socialize after their days which were probably more grueling and longer than mine. I just want to sleep. An Australian guy is chopping up wood right by my tent, dammit. I just want to sleep.

Big climb today up Killington. Left before 8am well-rested. It was a good idea to turn in so early the previous day. The white noise of the nearby stream also worked wonders.
Lots of steady uphill - it kept going and going. Nearer to the top, the trail got a lot rougher for some reason. Lots of roots and mud and such, and parts of the trail that were just barely there in the mountainside.
Made it up to the shelter finally. I was pushing myself because I thought the grill at the resort at the top closed at 2pm (they actually closed at 3pm). Still had enough time, so I ascended the last 0.2 miles with my pack on. Wow!! What a vertical climb straight up. Lots of nice footholds though, which was good. Only once did I have to put my poles to the side a bit and lift myself up with my hands.
Made it to the top and saw a bunch of day tourists lounging around on the rocks enjoying the view. I asked one family if they had a lodge up here with food, and they said something like “nah there’s nothing like that around here.” I told them as nice as I could that they were wrong, but I was starting to doubt myself... finally found it by the gondola lift. Prices were super steep, $19 for a burger... I also got a few beers and a fountain drink which I refilled 3 or 4 times for good measure. Enjoyed my afternoon up there and started to head back when they were closing the gondola. Walked back across the rock and had it to myself!
Then the journey directly down... it was scarier this time because you could see just how far you could drop. But I took it slow and made it.
As expected the shelter was super busy and the tent pads were already taken, so I found some other place to setup my tent and climbed in. Soon some other folks arrived and setup right next to me, since that was the only room available I guess. Didn’t mind it so much except one guy lit up some marijuana right there... very briefly thankfully.","Clarendon Shelter

Got a few snacks and lounged around the Deli way too long.

Just $6 and access to bathrooms, showers, and water taps all over the place.
Got a “small” campsite all to myself - campsite C. Had my own picnic table to myself and was happy - or so I thought. Here was another place where I knew there were folks with their families and here I was along in this world again... got a bit sad but what can you do.

Walked back to the AT and had a bit of a rough day for some reason - I think because my pack just weighs so much after my resupply. Seemed like way more uphill climbs than I expected.
Thundering Falls was a nice unexpected roadside attraction, and just north of it at River Road there was trail magic put on by two guys, one who thru hiked in 2013. They gave me a Gatorade and offered me snacks and a hotdog, but I was happy just with the Gatorade! And boy did I need it for the climb up the mountain... got quite soaked with sweat and had to take a few breaks. What a challenge with a full pack especially!
Got to some power lines in a clearing and tried to setup for lunch, but the sun was shining down too hard. Found a rock just south in the shade, still with a nice breeze, and enjoyed my deli sandwich and some Chex mix.
Finally made it to Stony Brook Shelter, where there has been lots of bear activity. I was feeling pretty spent and starting to get a bit of a headache, I think due to the heat. Would have stayed there, but Guthook and the physical logbook all mentioned a problem bear that kept coming by, unafraid of humans.

Another hot day. 
Hiked on to The Lookout, which was a privately owned place open to hikers. I had a nice lunch break there, the sweat from my back making a nice wet imprint on the wood wall. This was a really big place with a great view - the catch was that the best view was from on top of the roof, where a little crow’s nest was affixed, accessible via a very long wooden ladder. Managed to conquer my fear of heights briefly to get up - and once up I took a seat on a bench, which made me feel a little safer and less wobbly. Still scary - I got video and then went back down very slowly. Didn’t off myself! Success!
Stopped in at Winturri Shelter for water and a break, but the mosquitos and flies were overwhelming...
Hiked to Ascutney View, which is the 700 mile mark for folks like me out of Harper’s Ferry... Got a pretty bad selfie to commemorate the occasion, but the lens was so fogged up due to humidity, and every time I tried to clean the lens with my dirty shirt it just made it worse. Getting too dirty...
Up ahead there were some pretty thick bushes, almost like I was bushwhacking. I could see the road ahead and was relieved that the end of the day was in sight. But of course the road arrived later than I thought it would. The trail seemed to tease me and meander perpendicular to the road which was clearly ahead. Grr!

Got to Stage Road and did a road walk just short of a mile to a general store which had goodies and cooked up a breakfast sandwich for me. I even had a Killington beer for breakfast... Headed across the street to the library, but it was closed. I hung out a bit anyway, using some nearby Wifi.
It was gonna be another hot day, so I had a lot of Gatorade again...
Kept walking north and found some random hoses near the trail, strung up around the trees. I thought it was some trash someone left behind... there was even one going across the trail as a trip hazard. Saw more of these strewn up in the mountains around here before I realized these were active maple syrup taps!
Made it to Pomfret Road and saw an igloo in the water. There were some Adirondack orange sodas and root beers in there! I grabbed an orange soda and enjoyed it pretty quick.

Had a very late morning and left just as rain was starting up. For the most part it was a pleasant rain, not too hard. The trees absorbed most of it, and a few drops fell occasionally below that canopy and onto me.
While walking I heard a great big crack in the tree ahead and I stopped. I thought maybe some animal was climbing up there, but it was just a branch falling off. It was maybe 15 feet ahead, and it fell onto the trail. If I had been moving any faster it would have fallen right on me... Reminded me of a falling branch a few days back that fell behind me about 100 feet back.
Got into West Hartford and saw a blue barn up ahead with the AT symbol on it, with a group of folks having a fire on the porch. I walked across the bridge and was heading the opposite way, but the lady on the porch called out to me a few times and beckoned me it. It was Linda Hart and the Hart family - a trail magic spot for apparently decades. I got some coffee, a soda, and a slice of watermelon - and was sure to leave a tip. There were other hikers there as well, and we were all thankful for the reprieve from the rain.
Turns out that hikers were free to tent or stay in the barn, and it was tempting but I wanted to get closer to Hanover, so I headed to the next shelter.
Made it to Happy Hill Shelter and saw Detour again (she was at the trail magic house as well), an older lady who was staying in the shelter there.
I setup my tent in a gap between the rain - perfect timing. Found a great branch to hang my bear bear from, then cooked up dinner right in front of my tent.
Everything on me was pretty wet and smelly. The days of horrible heat mixed with the rain made for a weird concoction that made me smell like some sort of doughy stuff, like pizza dough or something. I really regretted not doing laundry at my last stop... I now desperately needed it.

But she was nice enough to direct me to the coffee shop. Populated by a lot of housewives, since it was right in the middle of the week...
Visited the bookstore next door and picked up a book on midlife crises which had been on my wish list for a while. Felt a bit silly walking around town with that, but whatever.
Walked towards the bridge and was ushered towards even more trail magic: some folks from Maine came down to anticipate their son’s arrival in the area, and they brought over their whole food truck setup. They were grilling up some burgers that smelled great, but I just accepted a soda from them. I wanted to get a proper lunch in town!
Crossed over the bridge which marked the state boundary - with “VT / NH” carved into the concrete to make it official (and another photo op). Finally walked into Hanover!
This city is a college town, home to the elite Dartmouth University. It’s somewhat funny to see the stereotypical fratboys straight out of any 80’s college movie - dress shirt, shorts, and an overconfident swagger. But here’s me mostly judging based on appearances. And some folks did the same back - I got one weird stare while looking to cross the street. But there were plenty of other hikers about, so I’m not sure what that was all about.
Had some ramen and tempura at a Japanese/Korean place run by Korean folks, then checked out the bookstore. Interesting store with a lot of vintage stuff, nothing tempting to buy, and besides I already had a brand new book to read...

Packed up and headed north as usual. Some steep areas around Velvet Rocks, where someone setup a thick rope for folks to climb up. 
Made it to Etna Road and walked about a mile down the road to the town’s General Store. It was going to be another hot day, so I made sure to drink a lot... buying. Gatorade or two has become a big habit lately.
Today apparently marks 1/3 of the trail completed for me... but it came and went without fanfare.
Made it to Moose Mountain Shelter and found the whole place was taken over by a big trail family or something. No worries, as I have been setting up my tent lately anyhow. The group was pretty loud and immature, but I guess they were enjoying themselves... I marveled at how much energy these folks had, especially since they had probably hiked farther than me that day...","Stealth Campsite 1750.7

Not sure why, but I had a ton of energy and motivation in the morning, so I hiked very fast. What helped was that it was pretty chilly, not hot at all (yet).
Lots of flies out around as usual, and today they seemed to want to fly right into my nose. They really enjoy flying into all orifices... I’m just happy to be wearing pants.
Also over the past few days I have seen these big spiders on the ground that resemble daddy long legs, except with a yellowish brown body. They feel me coming and scramble to get out of my way... and I try not to step on them...
Made it up to Holts Ledge. It was Saturday and this seemed to be a popular day hiker destination. One lady seemed to be struggling, and had some legs that seemed enlarged somehow. She said that she was doing a section hike from Mt Moosilauke to Hanover, and after completing that she will have completed the entire AT south of there in sections. She also gave her opinion of some peaks up ahead - said that Mt Cube was more technical than Mt Moosilauke. That was good to know (little did she know I would strongly disagree with her in a few days).
Made it up Smart’s Mountain. It was quite windy and there weren’t as many bugs, which was nice. However, this last stretch to get to the Smarts Tenting Campsite turned out to be very difficult. Maybe part of that perception was due to this being at the end of a long day, with probably the most uphill ascent I’ve done I a day on this trail...
Not many good trees to hang my bear bag from, so I actually had to hike the trail a bit north to find anything decent. Took care of that and setting up my tent before running out of daylight. And anytime I have time to do that is a good day...","Moose Mountain Shelter

Got up and wanted to make it up and over Mt Cube before some thunderstorms rolled in around 3 pm, so to save time I skipped a hot breakfast and just ate a protein bar. This was a big mistake... my energy level was down the entire day. And I should really know this by now...
I think this also made me pretty grumpy. I did not want any part in any conversation around me. I used to ask people’s trail names, but often I would only forget. So many people you meet once and then they’re gone... and so much effort to get a conversation going initially. Not having it today... I was grumpy Mr Solitude.
The day started with a nice gradually downhill down Smarts Mountain. That same trail that decided it was going to be hardcore uphill on the south side decided to be oh-so-gentle on the north side. But oh well, you just take it as it comes.
The first water was an awesome roaring stream at Jacobs Brook. Sat down and enjoyed it for a while - it was the first water source in a while.
Passed Hexacuba Shelter. Apparently the architecture is in the shape of a hexagon, and the privy in the shape of a pentagon. But I had to press on to avoid the weather..
Mt Cube was surprisingly green, and as usual the greenery trapped in a fantastic dense humidity that I was eager to escape. Farther on the mountain became rockier, then turned into rock ledges like something out of New York or Pennsylvania. At the very top it was mostly these exposed ledges, the sun beating down, and a slight breeze. And some giant thunderheads in the distance... gah!
Checked the weather and the nearest city changed again... this time to Lyme, which had no thunderstorms in the forecast. But just to be safe I started descending the mountain...
Started feeling pretty lethargic even while descending. I managed to drink through almost all my water, so I pushed on to the next water source, which of course seemed to take forever...
Passed a family, and the dad asked if I was “in it for the long haul”, and I told him I had been hiking since West Virginia for about three months or so. His jaw dropped and he told his family proudly. Ok, I don’t mind these types of interactions! This boosts my spirits.
At the water source I figured I was safe from any possible storms, so I broke out some snacks and had a decent late lunch. I also realized I probably didn’t have enough food... or just barely enough. Probably need to make a resupply stop...
While at that first water, lots of folks came through - a group of three, one, and another two that came by later. I just wanted a peaceful place to eat and relax! One girl from the group of three tripped over by foot while I was just sitting there. Leave me alone dammit!
Pushed on another four miles to the campsite and saw a group there. Found a campsite and started to hang my bear bag, and meanwhile everyone seemed to retire to their tents. Weird.
Again I seem to be the only one hanging my bear bag these days. I didn’t see anyone else’s bag hanging, but maybe they were out of sight? Strange. People are either getting lazier or more secretive.

Was running low on food, so I had a limited breakfast with some meal bars. I know this was not a good habit, but erred more on the side of conserving my food stash.
Luckily today was just a small summit - Mt Mist. It was hardly anything - not even a sign or a view at the top. All the sudden the trail just started descending, and that was it...
Not too bad. Made it to NH 25 and walked a bit to the Hiker’s Welcome Hostel, maybe around 2pm. Walked in and immediately another hiker gave me a freebie Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, which was wonderful. Another hiker offered one of his beers from his giant pack of beers as well.
Drank four Pepsis and hopped on the 5pm shuttle to the market, where I bought too much food and beer, and a big deli sandwich. Relaxed on their hammock and overheard someone playing banjo, as well as the old timers there telling stories of their old hiking days, and chatting about Earl Shaffer and old hiker gear, and also overheard about Shaffer calling Grandma Gatewood a “yellow-blazing fraud”. Apparently they were hiking nearby one day - Shaffer passed up Gatewood earlier in the day and hiked till the end of the day without seeing her, until at the end of the day he came across her ahead of him, sitting on the steps of someone’s home drinking sweet tea. I guess hiker drama has always been around...
Hostel stay was pretty relaxing and peaceful. A bunch of hikers were going to take the shuttle and slack pack Moosilauke in reverse the next day.

Checked out of the hostel around 9am and started the big ascent up Mt Mousilauke. Today was dedicated entirely to this ascent, and I was thinking of staying at the shelter that was just down the other side if I was too tired, so I didn’t yet make hotel reservations for North Woodstock, where I needed to stop to pick up some packages.
Wow, what a mistake in judgement! The ascent was maybe medium level difficulty. Got to the top which was super bare. Reminded me of Mt Greyback in Southern California. There was even a similar ground tundra (?). The trail to the top was very rocky, with flora on a thin topsoil surrounding both sides of the trail. Doubtlessly erosion caused by hikers like me on this popular trail.
The view was ok. But the folks gathered at the top was the big disappointment... folks taking off their shirts to pose for photos, being loud and annoying and such. I think I have a natural aversion to day hikers like these because they represent reverse culture shock... they are representatives of the world I have tried to escape temporarily. And yet they are similar - I am sure some of those folks were up there to escape society if even for just a day, on this Tuesday.
I took a few photos but wanted to get off the peak as soon as possible. I found that I needed to hike just a few hundred feet north, passing a few giant rock cairns, before getting out of earshot and eyesight. I set down my pack on one of those giant rock cairns and took a nice relaxing break, and a few more photos, including a selfie at a bad angle... but a selfie nonetheless, a rarity with me.
I was feeling bold, I knew I could reach the hotel today, so I called and had them put down my name.
Little did I know that the most challenging part of the hiker was about to begin...
The descent started ok enough, all the way to the shelter. After the shelter, the trail was flooded over with a stream. Ok, I have seen this before a few times... just needed to be careful with the slick rocks.
Continuing on, cascades paralleled the trail on the left side. This was the most slow and challenging 1.5 miles of my hike so far. Giant rock steps, wooden stairs drilled right into the rocks for support, and in some places some rebar handles. If it was icy or rainy I would fall for sure... As it was, parts of the trail were wet anyhow, due to the river and probably some humidity.
I have to say that since resuming my hike about a month ago, I have slipped a few times but haven’t fallen yet. But on this stretch I managed to do a slow-motion fall backwards, where I caught myself perfectly and didn’t fall much at all... so maybe some sort of a half-fall.
The wooden steps were there for help but they somehow ended up being the scariest part. A few times on those steps I felt a sense of fear I didn’t often feel on the trail luckily... the sort of fear of heights, of standing on one of those fire towers I couldn’t quite ascend fully...
Took it slow and safe, and it was a tedious effort but I finally made it down. That descent made the whole of Mt Mousilauke pretty much an all-day affair... I ended up passing up two other groups despite going slow - maybe I was too sure of myself. One group was an older lady that was intent on watching me as I descended towards them through a tricky section. I felt like she was just waiting for a spectacle waiting me for me to slip and fail somehow. Too much pressure.
Called up the hotel and they picked me up - nice service!

Took the Concord Bus from Gorham to Pinkham Notch for just $8.
Today I tackled the infamous Wildcat Mountains. Immediately noticed a less crowded trail compared to previous days, which made things a bit scary just in case something went wrong and I needed help.
The climb was challenging, and one spot in particular was very technical to get up. It was a bit of a choose-your-own-adventure, with two paths: a route on the left that made you ascend up a bare rock face, with no handholds or footholds and no branches or anything else to grab onto. I may have been able to do that, but then again I may have slipped and fallen right off trying to gain my balance.
The path on the right was the more obvious path: a wedge between two giant rock cliffs, with some rock steps in between. This looked doable, except that first step was kind of impossible to reach. My first attempt had me hanging on this step and finding no footing or handholds at all, then starting to shake as I realized I had to back down and try another attempt. It was here that I seriously considered turning back the way I had come, but that was also quite a daunting challenge in itself, definitely harder than my ascent.
My second try was a success: some sort of impossible hold, with one leg pushing up on the rock to the left, with barely anything carved out for a reliable foothold. I had to trust the sheer grip of my shoe here, then I pushed up and crawled onto my knees for the first step. I was shaky for sure, but I made it up each subsequent step also on my knees. What hell! Finally made it to the top of that section and prayed that the trail wouldn't get that gnarly after that, and thankfully it didn't.
But the rest of that section was definitely a challenge, and here more than ever I thought the trail wanted me dead.
Made it to Carter Notch Hut, the eastmost hut in the AMC hut system. I was depressed at my low mileage for the day, but the ""croo"" there seemed to think it was decent for that stretch.
This was a bit of a special day for this hut: the entire hut was closed to public bookings and the night was dedicated to the education of the Fall ""croos"" for each hut. For a while I was the only thru hiker there, so it was a bit of a rarity but I got to eat dinner as an ""equal"" with everyone else, getting the full dinner experience. In return I was a bit of an ""AT thru hiker representative"", even though I had only come from West Virginia. Later on some more hikers arrived, Poetry and Harmony, a quiet couple who ended up doing some morning chores. I ended up cleaning up and de-icing the fridge, then it was all done and around 9:30pm it was finally time for bed!","Gorham Motor Inn

Did the Carter Peaks and Mt Moriah today. Maybe not as crazy as the Wildcats, but still crazy in sections, with plenty of somewhat ""normal"" trail in between to get my hopes up. 
As always the descents are a nightmare - not even hiking, more like rock climbing. Found myself grabbing onto boulders and using my upper body as much as my lower body, which would be a recurring theme in the next days, leading to my entire body aching...
Mt Moriah felt a bit like the north side of Mt Wolf: a bit of an undermaintained trail with overgrowth, tree falldowns, and the like. Since both of these sections lay outside of the hut radius, they bring no money to the AMC, so I suspect they care less about trail maintenance here...
Didn't quite make it to the other Gorham road, so I stayed in the Rattle River Shelter. The hike down to it was pleasant and unusually nice. Not super easy - plenty of slick rocks, rock steps, and roots and such, but it was a nice easy departure from bouldering and climbing and such.

Crossed over the Maine/New Hampshire border today.
There was rain overnight. And as I was leaving the shelter I was surprised to see a larger garter snake. Haven't seen one in a while, and I have lost count of how many snakes I've seen in total. The count must be nearing 40 now.
Headed up Mt Success. The descent after a while got tricky and turned into some bouldering.
Right before the Carlo Col Shelter was an insane steep bouldering descent, where I was sometimes spread-eagle on rock faces hoping to create more traction while I tried to find footing for the next step down. This was a nightmarish section, and I swear I will have nightmares about that descent in the future. Despite the circumstances I somewhat calmly, slowly, and safely made it down. Somehow these things always work out.
Saw some sort of wild brown chicken or something (??) on the left of the trail. It just froze as I passed by, and somehow it caught my eye and seemed extremely unusual. I kind of stared at it a bit and calmly talked to it, and it eventually budged a bit and walked closer to what I took to be its nest. Then I walked away and let it be!
Was beat and decided to call it quits early at the Carlo Col shelter. It was truly wonderful to have time to read some of my book (about midlife crises, appropriately enough...) and not to rush my dinner. It was nice to have time to take time for a change.","Gentian Pond Shelter

Each day it feels like the trail is trying to kill me, and today was no exception. There was light rain overnight, and that meant most of today's trail would be wet.
I enjoyed my long morning and left around 10am. Thunderstorms forecast for the afternoon meant I probably wasn't doing Mahoosec Notch today, so I didn't have that far to go to get to the next shelter.
I think I am starting to understand Maine's trails. They are trails which are somewhat ok, though rocky and rooty, and then out of nowhere, with no warning, the trail can become terribly technical and scary. Today was filled with rebar handles, wooden ladders, and perhaps scariest of all is when these things were missing and it was just rock walls. More rock climbing than hiking... and all on mostly slick rocks.
Of course downhills were the scariest. A big slip and slide of a rock face descending downwards - maybe ok when dry, but it wasn't dry. Luckily many of these had side paths where I could grab onto trees and such, and slowly work my way down.
This is no doubt a challenging section of trail... just when I thought I was out of it with the challenge of the Whites, Maine rears its head. It's not all supposed to be like this, right?","Carlo Col Shelter

Got quite a late start today, and left after 10am. Today I did the infamous Mahoosec Notch, supposed to be the slowest and hardest one mile of the entire AT.
My approach to the notch was filled with anticipation - I wasn't sure whether it would be obvious I was entering the official ""notch"" section or if the change in terrain would be gradual with me not noticing, like a frog in slowly-boiling water. 
It was definitely noticeable! At the start I had to pause to consider the safest approach. I climbed up a big rock face to consider an alternate route, just as a tough looking southbound (SOBO) girl came out of the Notch. I thought I was in a safe spot, but I somehow was distracted and lost footing, falling somehow backwards and to the right, banging up my right arm and elbow a bit. I felt around to make sure I didn't break anything.
All these sorts of accidents happen when we are not paying attention, and think we're safe... Lukily I didn't have any other incidents after that.
The notch itself was more fun than terrifying. Definitely scary and challenging though. What a rough ride through some crazy tunnels and a variety of paths in a maze of boulders.
I soon caught up to the Doddering Duo, two older ladies, who were going slowly and methodically through. I liked their pace and stayed behind them for a while. They even helped me lift my pack through one of the tunnels. I was able to keep my pack on for most of the time, except for once in a very narrow tunnel...
Surprisingly, looking down into some crevasses you could still see some lingering ice blocks leftover from winter! I grabbed a few photos.
In one tunnel in particular, the Dottering Duo seemed to be having trouble ascending, so I had some time to look for some alternate paths. I found a path to the right that looked like it went up and over instead of down through the tunnel. It involved hopping over a steep crevasse, but I was able to do it, and it seemed way easier than the tunnel route! I met up again with the duo on the other side, and soon after that the entire notch was overwith!
Just after the notch was a tentsite, where I had a break and a quick snack before continuing up the next hill (up hills and down hills, that is basically all I do everyday).
Mahoosec Arm was a slog of an uphill climb after the notch, but I did it, sweating profusely!
Made it to Speck Pond Shelter, the last of the pay AMC sites. There was a beautiful pond nearby with lillypads, similar to Carter Notch Hut.

Baldpate East Peak - ascent on mostly dry open rock face. Too steep in many places. The cairns directed me on what looked like a more dangerous path, so I found some safer alternatives on the sides.
At 2pm I made a call to the hostel and scheduled a 4:30pm pickup. The hostel folks said it should take about 2.5 hours and I somehow agreed, despite them knowing nothing of my pace and me knowing nothing about what could lurk in that terrain. Maine has a habit of giving you these nice relatively normal hiking areas with areas that suddenly become crazy.
Luckily the terrain was great, so much so that I picked up the pace confidently downhill. Then, with my relatively lighter pack, decided I could actually run down this, so I did for a ways. Suddenly I saw some familiar hikers ahead. A startled Gomer Pyle up ahead looked back at me like I was some psychopath. I blurted out ""I don't usually do this, I just don't want to be late for my shuttle"". Turns out they were heading to the same place I was.
I got to the trailhead around 3:40pm and hitched a ride on their 4pm shuttle. Poor Gomer had to ride in the back trunk area of the truck.
An interesting native Indian guy named David drove us and told us about his weird hobby of fashioning things with moose poop... and he couldn't resist all the associated dad jokes, like telling his kids ""One day when I'm gone, all this shit will be yours""","Baldpate Lean-to

Got a 7:30am start, which is pretty early for me. This was mostly motivated by the fact that the morning shuttle out of the hostel was at 7am!
This morning was a great gradual uphill up Wyman Mountain. Passed Surplus Pond and saw what was apparently an old abandoned cabin there. Up the road in its direction was a little trickle of a water source. 
Lots of moose scat all around... but I still have yet to see one.
Came down the mountain and again went up another - Moody Mountain. These are climbs but they seem to be getting easier... nothing like the insane NH climbs.
Made it to South Arm Road and found Old Buzzard camped out providing a ton of great trail magic. Cowboy Up with a southern accent was settled in there drinking plenty of beer and tasting lots of great stuff, like corn on the cob and their great homemade mac and cheese.
I sat for a while, and soon the older Lost and Found showed up and grabbed a beer. Soon we all found ourself staying later than we all expected, and we eventually just gave in and setup tents all around the area.
I felt I didn't make much progress because I arrived just after 2pm, but it turns out I went a decent distance for the day. Sometimes you have to just give in to the moment...","Pine Ellis Lodging (Andover Hostel)

Nothing much eventful today. I woke and left late and thanked Old Buzzard and his son for the trail magic. He told me to look for his cabin when I got up to a certain viewpoint on Old Blue, and sure enough I saw it - the only building in the area, nestled in the trees.
Made it to the Bemis Mountain Lean-to and waited forever for my water bottles to fill up from the sad trickle at the water source. I really miss spring... summer and fall are too dry :(
Later the elder Lost and Found showed up. We chatted a bit, and soon I retreated to my tent and passed out... the best part of the day.","South Arm Road camping

Late start. Only Lost and Found at camp.
The day started with a descent down to a road, then an ascent up to highway 17. I had been assured by multiple folks that the stretch north of the 17 into Rangeley, the next town, would be a comparatively easy stretch, and it was.
At the highway was a bucket of drinks and bags of goodies. I grabbed a beer at first, but the soda water won out. Decided not to grab any snacks, though they were tempting. Was happy to leave it for other hikers.
Made it to a peaceful campsite pretty near town. Because of that it seemed to be deserted the whole night. There was a great pond nearby with some leaky kayaks. And a tiny water source with a pipe!","Bemis Mountain Lean-to

Woke up and heard the owners of the kayaks preparing to go out onto the water. They tried to be quiet and I thanked them later for that.
Hiked on and was looking forward to a rest day in town. Made it to Route 4 and hiked a bit to The Hiker Hut, where I had a package delivered. I was originally planning to spend the night there, but changed my mind and splurged for a private room in town instead.
I called the place and arranged for a pickup at the Hiker Hut around 11:30am. But almost a half hour later and it didn't arrive... something must be wrong?
In one of the strangest coincidences ever, Gomer Pyle and Sawbones pulled up in a car and picked me up. They were staying at the same place and borrowing the owners' car. We went all around to a bunch of sporting goods shops, lunch, and the grocery store.
Came back to my room and retired way early. Enjoyed a super comfy bed and relaxing night. Again ended up watching episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation on BBC America. It's been a constant companion to me these last few months staying in hotel rooms.","Little Swift River Pond campsite

The big focus of today was on a strenuous ascent of Saddleback Mountain and its neighbors. Great views today, surely some of the best I've had on this trail, and definitely helped by the fantastic clouds in the sky.
The whole area reminded me of Franconia Ridge in the White Mountains, except with way less people. All day I saw only three or four people, which was unusual. I haven't been seeing so many folks recently... I think I am thankfully past these north and southbound bubbles.","Fieldstone Cottages Rangeley

I must've been snoring last night. Every now and then during the night the lady section hiker would pound on the shelter floor and wake me up. Despite that I seemed to get a reasonable amount of sleep. Every now and then I would wake up in a haze and stare out at the blackness. Soon this blackness came to life in growing brightness...
Got way too late of a start, but somehow still managed to get up before the other hiker. I probably kept her awake... (she also had a damaged air mattress that was slowly leaking air, forcing her to inflate it a few times through the night).
Shoes and socks didn't dry completely the night before, so I sunned them out a bit and also switched out to my dry socks.
Today would be an easy day I was assured. But easy in Maine still means some minor rock and root challenges along the way.
Incidentally, this is the area where the thru hiker Inchworm disappeared years back. She stayed at the same shelter, then wandered off trail for a pit stop, and never found her way back. I find it amazing, since she was obviously experienced to get this far through the worst of the technical trails, only to end up simply lost. No injury, no fall, just disorientation...
I started seeing them yesterday, but today I saw way more tiny tiny frogs jumping to get out of my way on the trail. I was reminded of the little red newts which I haven't seen for quite a while now. I saw a few of them when I resumed my hike back in Massachusetts, but now they are gone. I think they change colors when they mature, and they must end up somewhere else other than standing right in the middle of the trail. Good, safer that way.
Strange to see many large groups of young folks around here. They always yield to me for some reason, and are sometimes eager to learn about my hike. I passed one group, then soon up ahead at Orbeton Stream I saw an even larger group enjoying the stream and jumping in (note to self: get water upstream from these waders!).
Tried to keep on the rocks to cross, doubtless under someone's watchful eye (pressure!), but it was too tricky on one rock, and I slipped and dunked my entire shoe in. Heck with it! I purposefully dunked the other shoe and just resigned myself to getting wet as I waded across the rest of the way. It was probably good for my shoes anyhow, since they were still caked with mud from yesterday.
Made it to the shelter early and didn't feel like going to the campground 6 miles away, so I setup my tent and retired early!","Poplar Ridge Lean-to

Very windy last night up in the trees, but not much below. Heard a branch fall, which freaked me out and kept me awake a bit during the night.
Got up and packed, and finished up my morning routine at the shelter itself, only to find myself stumbling across Gomer Pyle, and Sawbones who would join him later. Got started just before 9:30am. Sounds like they were shooting for the campsite 6 miles away, or the access road. Sawbones had a bad ankle...
Today I went up Spaulding Mountain, across the Sugarloaf trail (just short of Sugarloaf Mountain itself), and North and South Crocker Mountain. I was feeling pretty good, especially after a good breakfast (yes, it does matter a lot), so I was able to push through it. It was a pretty cold day though... found myself shivering every time I stopped for a break. Great day to knock out some peaks...
The north side of the Crockers was disappointing water-wise. I had planned to stealth camp there, but there was no water source that looked decent. All puddles... and the cold air and rustling trees didn't help to persuade me to stay. After finding just the puddle of water at my first choice, I grew disheartened and booked a bunk at the Hostel of Maine. Glad they had a bunk available...
I pressed further and saw Lost and Found (the Elder version) setting up a stealth spot. Chatted a while and pressed on. Was feeling pretty tired and sore by the time I got to the trailhead. I tried to hitchhike for 15 minutes unsuccessfully, but as it happens a car pulled by just as I gave up and was trying to call the hostel for a ride. I tried to give them money, but they wouldn't accept. They took me right to the majestic Hostel of Maine, a giant mansion of a place that apparently used to be a Bed and Breakfast.
Changed into loaner clothes, took a shower, and headed to Hugs, a nearby Italian restaurant, for some delicious food. A little nicer than a stealth camp site! A couple I chatted with briefly by the door ended up buying my dinner for me. No one has ever done that for me. I thanked them and stumbled outside into the really dark night. The massive suspended sea of stars above slowly became more visible, along with the Milky Way. I was feeing immensely grateful for the love I received that day and on my trip as a whole, and also sad and lost, questioning my purpose in the whole scheme of things. Teared up a little, no doubt under the influence of a bit of alcohol. Wanted to spend more time out there enjoying the stars on a night that was not too cold, but I was tired and decided to head into the hostel to bed.","

Light rain for a bit... then very cold, then the sun finally came out a bit. Put my puffy jacket on
Saw a fisher cat. Thought it was a mink, but I ID'd it later.
I'm filling in this section of my diary much later (Halloween 2019), but I remember this area being super memorable. Closer to the shelter is an amazing area with truly house-sized boulders plopped down amongst the landscape. There are even some small ""cave"" area which would probably be used as impromptu camps.
The blue blazed trail to the campsite was an interesting jumble of even more boulders, including a really nice partial cave area that I'm sure some folks have used to setup camp.
At the campsite I again ran into two folks who had passed me up earlier in the day. I wasn't too far behind, as it turns out.","Hostel of Maine

Started after 10am. Very windy all night and morning again. Maybe just this ridge??
Pretty easy day today - just up the little mountain. Some small challenges, rock faces. Grateful some of them were dry. Still wet, muddy in lots of spots
Checked in on Hurricane Dorian while I had reception. It was just now hitting Charleston... and in Maine it was a nice clear sunny day.
After Little Bigelow Lean-to, the trail became super easy. Hoping this is what 100 mile wilderness is like!!
Just had a few more hills to get over, then I arrived at a nice shelter by the lake. Hung my bear bag (hopefully no falling branches today...) and setup my tent while water was boiling. Ate some cheap dinner tonight - two Knorr sides. Getting tired of them. I want to get more Idahoan potatoes, plus the packaging on the latter is way better for pouring water into.
Added to some Propel to my water and gulped that down fast... my body has been craving that! Normally I try to avoid sugary drinks, but this stuff tastes amazing out here. Hit the spot!

Unfortunately I didn't fill in anything for this day (writing this on Halloween 2019). The most memorable thing about this day was for sure the ferry ride across the Kennebec River.
Beautiful skies full of really picturesque clouds, a nice place to take some photos at the riverbank.
I arrived and could see an empty folding chair setup on the other side of the river, but couldn't see anyone. The ferry operator must've been taking a break - in just a minute or two he came out of the woods and started preparing his kayak. I was pretty sure he saw me already, but I waved him down just in case.
It took just a minute or two to get across. That was easy!
I was happy to have made it across in the hours of operation of the ferry. I actually started this day quite early and made sure to pick up my pace, and it paid off.
Just at the other side of the river was the town of Caratunk, ME. Not much of a town - they have a post office, a fire department, and a hostel, the latter of which was my lodging for the night.
Caratunk House, like the best hotels on the trail, is operated by a former thru hiker. Because of the lack of a store in town, the hostel is well-stocked with everything a thru hiker would need really. Convenient!
Another nicety of this hostel was their milkshakes (with a few flavors! I tried plain vanilla) and pulled pork sandwiches, and of course I had to try both. I even ended up getting another milkshake the next morning for breakfast (coffee flavor).","West Carry Pond Lean-to

This is the last place before the 100 mile wilderness, so it was a useful place to recharge and work out logistics for a food drop in the middle of the 100 MW.

Didn't sleep too well last night, since my tent was setup on a slight incline. All the spots here seem to be like that.
Headed up Barren Mountain, then started the Chairback Range. This is a bit of a roller coaster of a day, definitely not an easy day in the 100 mile wilderness. A little bit of rock scrambling up and down, but thankfully the rocks aren't too slick today.
So much mud between peaks... I was about ready to stop skirting the edges of the mud piles and just wade in gleefully with abandonment. Thankfully for my feet I resisted and persisted.
Was aiming for a shelter, but missed it by 1.7 miles and instead found a decent camp spot by a roaring stream, which should provide some good white noise for sleeping.
Happy to get here early enough to have daylight to hang my bear bag, setup my tent and eat. Trees aren't super great for hanging here...
The campsite is also right next to a big rock face. Was scared the camp directly beside it, as water would probably flow over like a waterfall in the event of rain. Reminded me of the area at the Shaker Campsite, which has similar terrain.","Long Pond Stream Lean-to

Late start again around 10am. A few groups went by in each direction as I was eating breakfast and packing up. Not exactly crowds, but it does seem to get more traffic than other parts of the trail in Maine. There's some security in that.
My fuel burned out this morning, so I'm down to one small canister. I am pretty sure this will last me. That last canister was purchased from the Hostel of Maine nearly 100 miles ago. And I have less than 90 now.... cutting it close. Will probably shut off the fuel as soon as the water starts to boil now. No worries about diseases since I filter all the water I pour in there...
There was some unexpected serious downhill rock scrambling coming down Chairback Mountain, more technical than anything I've seen in days, maybe weeks. Was shaking a bit going down...

What a crazy day. I know there would be rain showers today, but wasn't expecting too crazy weather...
Woke up and made breakfast and could already feel it would be a very cold day. I ended up leaving on my puff jacket despite the fact I'd be hiking up four peaks today. That turned out to be a great choice. I actually ended up needing more than that at some point, when I should have put my wind breaker on, but stupidly I didn't.
I saw some southbound hikers who warned me about breezy winds pushing them around on White Cap Mountain, and found that it wasn't an exaggeration. The brief exposed area at the top had some really strong winds that definitely wanted to push me down. I was thankful for my trekking poles, but still had to fight to keep balance.
I also got to experience the weird phenomena of the ground ""breathing"" in high winds. These trees don't have much topsoil to work with, so when they sway in the wind they end of making all the topsoil sway with them. Weird!
Made it to Logan Brook Lean-to but I was quite wet and cold. I ate some snacks for lunch and actually ended up getting colder and colder the more I sat there waiting for the rain to stop. I kept shivering... not a good sign. My puff jacket was damp, but I finally put my wind breaker over it, which didn't help much. I finally forced myself to pack up and keep going to the next shelter to get warm, and it helped a ton. Plus I think it helped to get down off that windy mountain...

Writing this entry long after the fact (on Halloween 2019), and I have just a few notes to spark my memory.
Saw another fisher cat today! I remember it ran away faster than the previous one. I thought I'd have time to get out my phone to film this apparently rate sighting, but no luck.
Undoubtedly the best part of the day was a food drop from Shaw's. It came at a hefty delivery cost ($85) but was worth it. But I packed entirely too many Mountain House meals!
By chance two other hikers who I saw at the previous shelter (when we were all freezing cold) came up to the road crossing just as my mail drop was getting delivered. The folks at Shaw's threw in 3 sodas, one for me and 2 others for any friends who may be traveling with me. Before we saw the two hikers, I let the driver drink one of them.
The other hikers came by and stopped - I think they were expecting this to be some sort of trail magic. They started devouring my food bucket with their expectant eyes. I felt a little annoyed and a little sympathetic at the same time, but more annoyed to be honest. I don't like folks waiting around for handouts, and to my discredit I don't have a charitable bone in my body. Though I know Jesus would have had an entirely different attitude. It really is a hard challenge to love your neighbor... I am trying to get better.
I gave the hikers the last soda, but nothing else. It was never really mine to begin with.
The last note I have for the day mentions this was an easy day, and I made really good progress. This was finally the easy part of the 100 mile wilderness! The only hard and technical parts remaining would be Katahdin itself...","East Branch Lean-to

Wasn't feeling too well today, I think I was letting my thoughts get carried away (worrying about where I would live and work after hiking).

I had to go out of my comfort zone today to get in more miles to stick to my plan of going up Katahdin September 19. The easy terrain continued thankfully, so it was a good day to do it.
The highlight of the day, other than the good progress, was unquestionably my first and only moose sighting! A female moose wandered onto the trail ahead of me and was stubbornly sticking around the trail ahead. I let it know I was nearby by making gentle noises from afar. It seemed to turn up its head at me now and then between grazing sessions, but eventually got bored of me. I inched closer very gradually while taking video. Finally it moved far enough off the trail for me to get by. I made it without getting trampled!
My plan for the day was to get to Hurd Brook Lean-to today, then wake up early to sign up for Birches Campsite. There was only one other guy with me at Hurd (trail name Flip), and we had only sort of an obligatory chat. He told me that he had the same plan as me, and that we seemed to be luckily between bubbles. He had even called up the hostel in Millinocket, and they only had two hikers staying there that night. We were both speculating as to how crowded it would be.

Left Hurd at 6am, just after the other hiker. It was very very cold, and I didnt sleep well at all.
I was super happy to see the backside of the other ""entering 100 Mile Wilderness"" sign, then a road with cars on it. Civilization!
At Abol Bridge there was a store and restaurant with a breakfast buffet. I picked up a light resupply - just snacks for the day really, then went to town on the AYCE breakfast!
Ate fast, left and got to the Birches signup at 8:20am. I was just the second person on the signup sheet, the other one being Flip, who had stayed at Hurd with me.
Turns out we got lucky. There were only three of us on that signup sheet today. It was just him and I and one other hiker staying at Birches that night (Jellybean).
Took it real slow, got to the ranger station, paid the campground fee, then made plans for tomorrow. Got a nice hiker registration card!
I lazed around Birches campground all afternoon, eating early and then resting up. While cooking up my last Mountain House meal of my hike, Sketch came by to pick up the tent he left here. He summited today! He planned to head to Boston to meet a friend before returning to Osaka, then had no plans for after really. He is a freelance illustrator, and it sounds like he was talented enough that he wouldn't have an issue finding work....

Specter of real life
Last day of hiking today. Feels weird but fitting somehow. I think I'm ready for it to end.
Woke up decently early and was sure to make a nice decent breakfast. Didn't want to skimp or be lazy on this day in particular; I know how much a good breakfasts affects the rest of the day's hike.
Turns out that only three of us slept at the Birches overnight: Jellybean, Flip, and me. All folks I'd met pretty recently. Flip is the same guy who I stayed with at Hurd.
Got of a bit later start than I would've liked - it was already pretty bright outside. There was a bridge out ahead, and a blue blazed trail to get around it. I decided against fording the river and took just the third blue blaze on this entire trip. I resigned myself to just hiking half the AT for the year, so I guess the idea of being a purist and hiking 100% white blazes went out the door. The only other blue blazes I took: 1) a detour around a deep beaver bog and 2) a blue blaze around the Bear Mountain zoo, since it was closed!
While hiking along I already had thoughts of what life would be like after the trail. I hastily took this vaguely poetic note: ""The shadows of the rising sun are slowly getting shorter, but the specter of real life is creeping back in, casting its own long shadows""
The ascent started pretty gradually, not too bad at all really. I soon came across areas of the trail which were flooded, where the stream was the trail, in classic AT fashion. I had to laugh - the trail had truly become a character in this whole struggle, and had its characteristic qualities, one of them being ""surprise! the trail is now a stream!""
The Hunt trail got harder and more technical. Soon the rock hopping and scrambling turned into more technical bouldering, almost rock climbing. There was a particularly difficult section with small iron rungs for foot and handholds. Most of these turned out fine, except for one in particular which was difficult: an immediate squeeze after ascending an iron rung section, with bare rock and a steep drop to the left. I didn't see any better way to get up - I resigned myself to this fate and spread out onto the rock above to leave more of my surface area on the rock, creating more friction and less chance of falling. No holdholds...
I somehow slithered my way forward under the rock, with the top of the rock scratching my pack. Maybe I should have slackpacked after all... Somehow I made it through though, and when it was safe I slowly and steadily stood up.
This was the scariest part of the whole hike up and down, and I was shaking, just like in the Wildcats. Up ahead was plenty more scrambling uphill seemingly endlessly, but with beautiful clear vistas on either side of me, with lakes and mountains and greenery, way more spectacular than the Whites.
After finally getting through the very rocky section and onto the flatter plateau, I could make out what turned out to be the final cairn up above. This was it - the final stretch! This area was as pleasant as could be except for the small rocks I was crushing below me.
Up ahead were the two older gentlemen I'd seen at Shaw's and had run into a few times over the past few days, in the 100 miles wilderness, and at the Abol Bridge breakfast place. I never got their names, but one of them was with a leg brace and was graciously offering rides to a lot of through hikers passing by, including Jellybean, who was just coming down.
I pushed on up ahead and gradually was able to make out small sticks moving around the cairn above. A group of people! That was the end for sure.
Make it up and there was a giant group up top, a mix of day hikers and thru hikers. Soon more thru hikers came through - some 20 something party trail family that were having fun and an emotional end. I had seen some of their comments on Guthook and kind of wanted to steer clear of them. I guess I have never been into that... humbug! (All through this hike I have struggled with how to deal with other people in a positive and tolerant way... I suspect I have learned nothing)
Snacked a bit and then headed back. Gathered some gross algae water from Thoreau Spring and then headed down Abol trail, which was more tedious than difficult. Turns out Abol is the name of a rockslide which the trail coincides with a large part of the way. As such it is the shortest way down... It also turns out that half of the rock slide trail became too hard to manage after constant subsequent rockfalls (who would've thought?!), so trail maintainers built an alternative path. As soon as that alternate path started, the trail became a bit easier. Then I really started cruising and my morale got boosted. Then treeline, and things smoothed out even more, as I'd hoped.
Further and further down, then the trail became a stream again (one last time!), then it became a walk in the part when I had just a mile remaining.
My parents, who had decided to fly up to meet me, decided the last minute to drive in to pick me up after all! When I was up at the top of Katahdin I got a text message from them saying they would drive into Abol campground to meet me! So I wouldn't have to hitchhike out after all.
As usual I was slower than everyone else and not making good time... I got to my parents' car around 4:45pm or so and was very happy to see them! We drove into Millinocket, where they were staying, and had pizza for dinner.
Truly the greatest challenge is ahead - reintegrating back and figuring out my place and my own goals in this crazy world. I hope to finish the other half (the easier half!) of the AT another time.","Birches Campground

Philosopher / Kierkegaard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625684,"It's been a few months since I've been off the trail.  Overall I think I'm in good health.  My knees thankfully have given me no problems, and seem to be fully healed (they were pretty messed up mid-hike).Unfortunately I developed some plantar fasciitis in mostly my left foot, which has left me hobbling around a bit.  I bought some inserts for my shoes, and that has helped a bit.  I still have the ""hiker hobble"" after waking up in the morning or getting off the couch after too much inactivity.After my hike I was skinnier than I've ever been, and I should have known better, but I bought all new clothes anyway, knowing full well most hikers gain weight after their hike.  I have gained a bit too much weight, so this month I'm starting Whole 30 as a sort of way to cleanse, and I've been walking at least 10k steps every day.Interestingly, during my hike my best resting heart rate was 58 bpm.  After my hike it steadily increased and went up to as high as 70bpm, thanks to my inactivity and probably bad eating.  Usually these days it has hovered around 65bpm, but after starting my diet and daily walks it has thankfully plummeted back down to 60bpm!There are not many mountains around where my folks are in South Carolina, but there is a beautiful neighborhood park with some of the preserved swampland.  It's crazy flat and has no real roots or obstacles of any kind, so it's a bit too easy compared to the crazy hiking I left off with in New Hampshire and southern Maine.  But I'm thankful for that park, since it really reminds me of the AT.Before, during, and after my hike I resolved to find a meaningful job where it wouldn't feel like I was wasting my life or my time.  I have been too picky and haven't yet found that ""dream job"" and I think I may need to compromise.My mom says I should use the opportunity and just complete the second half of the AT in spring, which is not far off.  As I struggle to find work, that possibility becomes more and more of an option....",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Fri",0
