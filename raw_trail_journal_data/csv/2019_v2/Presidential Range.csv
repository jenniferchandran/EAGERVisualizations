Presidential Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622414,"I stayed overnight at the Notch Hostel near Franconia. I checked out early and drove to Crawford Notch. It was a sunny day. I was ecstatic to begin my first day of hiking on the Presidential Range.
I started hiking at 7:00 AM and quickly summited Mt. Jackson at 4,052 feet. The views were nice and I took some pictures and video of Mt. Washington and the surrounding mountains. 
I hiked a few more miles up to the Mitzpa Spring hut to see what it was like. It was right next to the trail. By day's end I had summited Mt. Pierce at 4,312 feet, Mt Eisenhower at 4780 feet, Mt. Franklin at 5001 feet, and Mt. Monro at 5,372 feet.It was soo nice on the summit of Mt. Eisenhower that I spent an hour in the sun getting my yoga in and relaxing.
I made it to the Lake of Clouds hut around 4:00 PM. It was exactly what I envisioned It to be. A high elevation hut modeled after those found in the Swiss Alps. The place had 6 staff waiting on about 40 guests. The hut is at over 5,000 feet elevation and 1.5 miles from the summit of Mt. Washington.
Before dinner I had time to walk around the 2 lakes adjacent to the hut and enjoyed the views and took more pictures. Dinner was served family style and the food was passed around in bowels and platters. The food was excellent and plentiful.
This was the best solo day of hiking ever for me. It will be hard to beat. I'm guessing its what hiking in Heaven must be like.","Crawford Notch

Presidential Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622417,"I awoke to the sound of pouring rain and wind hitting the roof. Breakfast was served at 7:00 and was plentiful.
 I changed into my rain suit, packed and headed out. It was a 1.5 mile hike up to the summit. Fortunately, the trail was fairly easu to traverse and the wind was at my back. 
I summited Mt. Washington in 50 mph winds and moderate rain. I took a photo and a short video at the summit, then ducked into the visitor center to dry off and drink hot chocholate. 
From the summit I started the 6.5 mile track to the next hut in the pouring rain and 50 mph winds. The wind dropped down to 25 mph after the first half mile. The rain continued all day and wind gusts were often 40 to 50 mph.

After coming down off the summit the trail leveled out for a mile or two. The last 5 miles consisted of varying terrain, but nothing that I was not prepares for. I slipped a few times but did not fall. I m sure all your prayers helped.

I strolled into the Madison Hut lodge around 2:00 PM soaked thru. Fortunately I had a hand towel and dry clothes in a dry bag to change into. I drank a few cups of hot tea and rested an hour. I then did an hour of yoga. By 5:00 PM the hut was only 40% full and nobody else came.

Dinner was served at 6:00 sharp. It was good and plentiful. After dinner the staff gave a presentation on the plants and animals around the hut and range, just like the staff at the other huts did.  
I retired at 8:30 and was fast asleep by 9:00. I slept well as there was little snoring from other guests.","AMC Lake of Clouds Hut

Presidential Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622419,"I slept well and enjoyed a nice 7 AM breakfast with fresh coffee. It was very foggy outside so I lounged around the hut for an hour before leaving hoping the fog would break but it didn't.
The first part of my hike was a half mile climb over Mt. Madison in dense fog and mild wind. Visibility was very poor. I left the summit without taking any pictures. After hiking a mile down the fog broke allowing me to get some nice pictures of the range, trail and valley below. Yay!
From the hut I hiked 3 miles down to the valley, 5 miles to the notch and 6 miles over the Wildcats to the next hut. The last 5 miles were my hardest ever and consisted of over 4000 feet of elevation change, mostly up. 
I arrived at the hut at 6:50, threw on some dry clothes, ate a big dinner and drank lots of herbal tea. I then led the hut staff and a few hikers in a 45 minute yoga class. It really helped loosen the hiking muscles and joints. Everyone enjoyed it. 
I retired into my own mini hut because there were very few guests and lots of huts empty. There were only six guests total so I had the mini hut to myself.","AMC Madison Spring Hut

Presidential Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622420,"After a good night's sleep I walked down to the kitchen hut at 7:00 to enjoy a warm filling breakfast and coffee with fellow hikers. I then packed up and hit the trail by 8:30.
The first mile included over 1,000 feet of elevation and soaked me thru with sweat. I then hiked over a half dozen peaks each over 4,000 ft in elevation, mostly in the fog and rain. Hence I only took a few pictures.
A thunderstorm passed over just before starting my decent into the valley making some of the trail extreemly dangerous. I took my time and made it down. The last 3 miles were a pleasant river walk. I concluded my 16 mile hike by 6:00 pm. 

I was sore all over and was really looking forward to a travel day tomorrow with no hiking. In the hiker community they call this ""taking a zero.""
Paul, the owner of the hostel picked me up and drove me to his place in Gorham, just 2 miles from the trail head.  Despite calling ahead for a reservation he said I was not listed. Fortunately I got the last bed. I took my first shower in 4 days then washed and dried my clothes. The cost for the bed and laundry was just $29. Yay.","AMC Carter Notch Hut

Presidential Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622415,"Ever since I was a kid I dreamed of hike up to the summit of Mt. Washington. Several of my siblings and friends hace since hiked it.
I began section hiking the AT one week at a time starting in 2016. By summer of 2019 I had hiked about 650 miles of the 2,200 mile trail from the Deleware Water Gap to central NH. 
I started planning this trip a few months ago. I picked the first week of Sept because some of the high elevation huts close by mid Sept. Reserving the huta was easy and done online. 
I reserved a night at the Notch Hostel near Franconia, a 4 hour drive from home. I had stayed there before and liked the experience. The place was clean and under new management. 
I had to figure out where to park and reserve trip shuttles. For just $20 I reserved the AMC shuttle on day 5. I called a trail angel to schedule my other ride. I got the contact from my prior NH hike and was quoted $24.
A few weeks before leaving I made a gear list and was happy to see that I had everything I needed. I also packed a duffle bag with spare clothes and snack for resupply on day 5 and the drive home.
I was hiking almost every Saturday morning for the prior few months and took up yoga and using the treadmill at the Senior Center. Yoga gave me a full body workout. I set aside 45 minutes at home every day for it. I was ready!",,View Entry,"Sep 05, Thu",0
Presidential Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622562,"I got 8 hours of rest at the hostel and woke up at 7:00 AM. I walked a 200 yards down main Street to a nice restaurant to have a delicious breakfast. The music was 50s and 60s and very relaxing.
On the way back to the hostel I walked by the old train station and took some pictures of the trains to share with Bryson when I get back.
I returned to the hostel by 8:00, packed my gear and charged my phone. Check out time was 9:00 AM. I walked down main street a half mile to find a D&D that had WIFI. I had coffee and a muffin while uploading all of my pictures to google photos. I walked back toward the hostel to catch the 11:10 shuttle to the AMC Highland Center.
I arrived at the center at 12:15 and dropped my pack off at the front desk. I walked to my car and got some more snacks and beverages for the upcoming 2 day hike. I strolled around the grounds, had lunch and did an hour of yoga. It was a nice break from my 4 day 62 mile hike. 
They had a large art exhibit in the Thayer Hall cinsisting of poster size prints of pictures taken by Bradford Washburn, a famous world traveled adventurer whos pictures rival that of Ansel Adams. I then bought a book about him at the hotel store. I will start reading it tonight.
Dinner was served family style in the mess hall and consisted of the best food I have had on my trip. I took some pictures of it and the menu to share. Most of the 35 guests retired by 8:15 and so did I. I'm really looking forward to hiking up Franconia ridge tomorrow morning. The weather looks promising with no rain. I hiked it on the 4th of July and loved it.","The Libby House Inn

Presidential Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622563,"Ok. I know what some of you might be thinking. Why are you still creating entries in your Presidential Range journal 3 days after you exited the range? The answer is two fold. 1. If I created a new journal I would have had to create and send out a seperate link to it. 2. The second leg of my hike week ends at the start of the range.
I had a nice buffet breakfast at the Highland Center, packed up and made my shuttle pickup by 7:45. He drove me to the Falling Waters trailhead.

I started hiking the trail at 8:45. This was my first time on this 3 mile trail and it was wonderful. There was a lot of variety, including several waterfalls, rock scrambles and over 2,000 feet of elevation. I completed the trail and made it to the summit of Mt. Haystack by 10:20.
After a quick change into dry clothes I continued North up the Franconia Ridge, arguably the nicest 1.5 ridge hike in the Northeast. I made it to the summit of Mt Lafayette by noon and was feeling good sitting at over 5,350 feet elevation.

I spent an hour hiking down to the valley at around 3,000 feet. I hiked 1,000 feet up the the summit of Mt. Garfield at 4,500 feet elevation and 1,000 feet down the other side. I then had a 3 mile hike over difficult terrain to get to the Galehead Hut, where I checked in.
I quickly took my wet and smelly clothes off and used a wash cloth with soap and cold water to clean off. I changed into dry clothes and went to my bunk room to do some yoga, meditation and relax. 
Dinner was served at 6:00 PM sharp family style. It was excellent and culminated with chocholate cake with chocolate cream and blueberries. It included herbal tea and coffee.
I sat in on a free nature talk and spent some time talking to some hikers before retiring. It was a fabulous day!","AMC Highland Center

Presidential Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622568,"I slept sound until 6:45 AM, had hot coffee and a delicious full breakfast prepared by the cook. I packed up and talked to a few thru hikers who were attempting to complete the trail in central Maine before Baxter State Park closes in mid October.
I left the hut around 8:40. The first mile required hiking up over 1,000 elevation to the summit of South Twin Mountain at 4,902 feet elevation, then back down 700 feet to something that resembled a level trail. The rest of the  7 mile section was full of smaller ups and downs and tiring. It was mostly sunny and dry and I took a loy of pictures.
I made it to the Zealand Falls hut by 12:30, had a lunch bar and rested for 30 minutes. The afternoon section was 8 miles long and mostly flat trail. I finished the hike by 4:00 PM. It was overcast and dry.
It was a huge relief to have the easiest section to hike at the very end of my vacation. The total for the day was 15 miles. The trip total was 88 miles. I averaged nearly 15 miles per day for 6 days on the trail.
As soon as the hike was over, I entered the parking and got a ride within a minute from the first car pulling out. He drove me 3 miles north to my car. It was somewhat nice to be back to civilization and not waiting for a ride.
I drove to the Notch Hostel near Franconia, checked in and took a hot shower. I did my 45 minute yoga routine and made some noodles and veggies for dinner. I had plenty of protein already. I then drank some hot peppermint tea while writing this journal entry. 
I think I will celebrate my success by eating a pint of ice cream. They have lot's of flavors at the hostel for just $5 each. I'm sure to sleep well tonight and have a nice drive back home tomorrow morning. I miss my family and look forward to seeing them.","AMC Galehead Hut
