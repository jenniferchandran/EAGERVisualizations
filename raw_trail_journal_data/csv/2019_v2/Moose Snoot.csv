Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614411,"Tomorrow, I head back into the woods for the first time this season. It's funny how no matter how many times I do this, I get nervous.
This one is the start of something much bigger. An almost unfathomable goal that I'll reach in 5 years? Maybe 10?
I'm going to hike the entire Appalachian trail. All 2100 miles of it. In a way, I've already started. In 2017, I hiked the Long Trail in Vermont which shares its first 100 miles with the AT. But this summer, tomorrow, I officially start my section hike. Tomorrow, it goes from something I want to do to something I AM doing. It's a new goal. A new challenge. A new motivation. 
There's this apprehension that comes with starting a long journey or working toward a big goal. In those first steps, I have to commit to myself and trust myself. But I also have to forgive myself. Forgive myself for my future mistakes. Forgive myself for my failures. I have to give myself the space to take on something without knowing that I'll be successful. For me, that is the scary part. I'm vulnerable. But it's worth it. It's worth it when I stand at the summit, drenched in sweat, miles and mountains behind me, and more ahead. It's worth it when I wake up in the morning, every muscle sore and walk in time with the birdsong. It's worth it at lunch as I sit next to a stream, everything finally quiet, including myself. 
Right now, I'm nervous. I'm worried that I'll miss my train or I'll have forgotten some key piece of gear. I'm worried that I'll get to the first campsite to find no available space, meaning I'll have to walk another three miles. I'm worried that I've over-estimated how many miles I can do or how many pounds I can carry. Or maybe I've under-estimated how many hours it will take or how many calories or how much fuel I need. Im worried that I might fail. But, in the end, I know without a shadow of a doubt that it will all be worth it.

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615014,"Queens to campsite at mile 1303.9Total miles: 6.8Total trains: 4Total smelly cars with old(ish) oversharing men: one. But for AN ENTIRE HOUR
Today, I woke up in the middle of one of the most populated cities in the world. Then, four trains and an hour long cab ride later, I stepped onto a very crowded trail. And now, I'm laying in a tent, on a ridgeline, completely alone.
Oh boy did I make some great time today! Which is great because after passing what had to be the fourth boy scout troupe headed for the same campsite as me, I made other plans. The other plans involved 3.7 additional miles, but I was still riding the adrenaline high of being back out here that I barely noticed them pass. I'm sure my body will remind me about them tomorrow...
It was a great day to be back at it. The weather was warm, but not too warm, the sky was clear enough to get some beautiful views, and the trail itself was very kind. And for once, my brain was pleasantly quiet. I was able to keep a great pace the entire day without too much trouble... Then again, maybe it helps that my best comparison, trail-wise is the Long Trail in VT.  I still have nightmares about some of those climbs. ""This can't be the trail. That's literally a rock face... Ah, with a rope attached to it. Darn you Vermont!!! *shakes fist angrily toward the sky*"" 
It's occurring to me that there's no chance that I'm going to be happy about going back to civilization on Wednesday. Probably, someone will have to drag me kicking and screaming all the way back to Queens.","Queens

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615079,"The wind last night was intense! (Or should I say inTENTs?! Ahahah get it??) I was woken at one point by what I thought was just my water bottle falling over. When I rolled over, though, I realized that the wind had ripped the vestibule stake out of the ground and slammed the door against the side of my tent. I got out of the tent to assess and restake the door, but quickly realized that no amount of staking down would work. Luckily, there were a ton of heavier ricks around, so I grabbed my paracord and rigged to a nice sized rock. Thanks to years of stagehanding, I know how to tie a bowline! The wind, rain, and lack of light, however, were an added challenge. After a few tries, I got it and scurried back into my sleeping bag. I slept like a baby for the rest of the night!

Today's hike was nearly perfect. The miles flew by with plenty of rewarding views, fields of blooming wildflowers, and plenty of wildlife. Now I'm back in camp, ready for dinner. Just need to hike down to the water first...","Campsite Mile 1303.9

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615080,"I've learned something just now. Never EVER leave your tent uncovered and leave camp. Because even if the skies are blue and clear and the forecast shows no rain, you'll be three-quarters of the way to the water source (which is nearly a mile straight downhill) when you start feeling sprinkles. In that moment, you'll need to make a decision... Keep going, knowing that your sleeping bag is just getting drenched right now, but there's nothing you can do, or turn around and run straight up a cliff in hopes of beating a little bit of the rain. I chose option B and now I'm ANGRY. My tent had an actual puddle in it. Everything is wet. Miraculously, I have one dry shirt. But beyond that, my clothes are wet. My shoes are wet. My sleeping bag is wet. MY PILLOW IS WET. And I'm cold. And I'm wet. Backpacking sucks. I don't know why I do this. It is actually the worst.","

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615104,"Ok, so maybe I was being a tad dramatic last night... I did finally drag my mopey butt out of my tent to make dinner and wound up chatting with some other backpackers. Walking Home is a thru hiker who initially started his hike as a way to lose weight and get into shape. Now he is hiking just to see how far he can go. He says he won't summit Katahdin when he gets there, but I'm having a hard time believing that... After they made their dinner, Big Tex and her dad Old Bear came to join us, and we had a good time chatting about past hikes, our lives back home, sports, and colleges. When I finally laid down for the night, everything was still wet, but my spirits were up. I formed a plan to get up in the morning and drag my soggy things up to the top of the next mountain to dry in the sun. I didn't have to do that, though. When I woke up this morning, everything was dry!
The hike was nice. Lots of sun and more beautiful views. I played leapfrog with my hiking acquaintances as we each stepped to our own beat. Tonight, I'm back in camp with Walking Home, Old Bear, Big Tex, and some new friends who also happen to be my real life neighbors. Chris and Christina (The Nice Couple) are Jackson Heights residents, which means we probably ride the same trains regularly. How funny that we had to go all the way into the woods of New Jersey to find one another!
We all stopped for lunch at a restaurant right on the trail as it walks through a small town. What a treat to have fresh food and a cold beer! 
Tonight, I'm staying in the shelter with Big Tex and Old Bear to avoid any more rain. Tomorrow, I'm planning on walking to the state park and catching a ride to Port Jervis. From there, I'll catch the 9:30pm train to the city, a shower, and my warm, dry bed.","Buttermilk Falls tentsite mile 1316.1

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615097,"I'm sitting in the parking lot at he High Point State Park headquarters, waiting on my ride into town for dinner and a train home. The headquarters has closed, and all of the folks that I've walked with the past few days have caught their shuttles into town or headed back into the woods. I'm all alone save the fog, the birds, and the frogs chirping away on the pond out front. This serenity is what calls me back time and time again. As my inner peace mingles with that of the universe; of nature, things fall into balance in a way that I can't even begin to replicate anywhere else. This is where I belong.

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616141,"Today was mostly a travel day... We had a 4 hour car ride and got to bearfence mountain trailhead around 3. The drive through SNP was beautiful! I think this chunk of the AT is going to be a treat.
After changing shoes, suiting up, and a quick little photo shoot, mom and dad waved me back onto the trail.
The trail started out steep but quickly leveled out for the next mile or so until a long, semi steep climb up to hazletop mountain. I have no idea what happened between last weekend and now, but my legs were NOT ready for that climb. You spoiled me New Jersey! I did make good time, but man did I work for that last mile... 
I had it on good authority that there were some stealth sites on the summit, so I started looking around. It took a few moments before I realized that they were just down a spur trail to a view. I'm sure the view is breathtaking, but all I'm getting tonight is a drop-off into a sea of fog. It's not the best view, but it did just fine for dinner.
Dinner tonight was home made pepperoni rolls, a hard boiled egg, and a cookie. Normally, I do a full meal like ramen, but I didn't come across a water source today, and won't for a couple of miles tomorrow, so I wanted to conserve.
It's just starting to rain, which is just fine because I'm warm and cosy in my tent. Hopefully it clears up by morning and I can get a peek at that view! In the meantime, I better get some rest. 12 miles tomorrow!","

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616142,"Some days on the trail are ""why do I do this? It super sucks"" days, and others are ""why don't I do this full time it super rules"" days. And then some days, when everything comes together into a perfect storm, I get to ride a roller coaster of sky high to suck all within a handful of hours. Yay!!!!Today was that day. Except I suppose it was less roller coaster and more steady decline into full suckage.
It rained all night last night, but it stopped shortly before I woke up, and I finally got to see what that sea of fog was hiding! It was absolutely breathtaking, and was an amazing way to start my first morning on the trail. I skipped breakfast so that I could get to the water supply faster, but did sacrifice some water for tea (oh sweet sweet caffeine. You are even more glorious in the woods). I've been focusing on being more mindful on the trail. I want to spend less time in my own head and more time in my surroundings. When I slow my step and quiet my brain, I see and hear much more. Today, it was deer. So many deer! I'd say the population might be a bit high in SNP, but that didn't stop me from taking pictures of every single one of them... I also encountered so many different people from day hikers to thru-hikers. I even ran into some friends that I met last week on the AT in New Jersey! They're out doing a loop this weekend and just happened to pass me on the trail headed south. What an insanely small world! I wish I had thought to get their names again, but they did say that they were part of a hiking group called the Trail Dames and I just love that so much. Running into them put such a smile on my face! 
For lunch, I stopped at a beautiful cliff edge with an insane view. And beyond a few pretty flowers, that's about where my day started to turn toward the suck... 
It's going to rain tomorrow. All day. ALL. DAY. While I know there's nothing I can do about it, and I know I just need to embrace the suck, I still let it color part of my day. I decided to push on a couple more miles past my planned campsite while I have dry weather. I assumed that I'd find a decent campsite near the Skyland Resort. Which I did... Kind of. It's next to a giant water tank. HUGE. And turns out it's basically right on the trail (no idea how I missed this one since I was JUST on it but whatever Rachel, let's just go with it). The tank, I knew about, but I missed the trail until I saw someone walking down it... And they saw me pretending not to see them. (don't judge me fellow hiker, I swear I'm not new at this! Just a little soggy and tired...) 
So here I am, everything hurts, I'm damp because it's the outside and they don't have air conditioning here and also because I'm wearing the same clothes as yesterday, and I'm camping in basically the ugliest place I've seen on the AT. 
BUUUT I hiked 12 miles today and now I have 2 less miles to do in the rain tomorrow. And I'll be sleeping in a shelter tomorrow so no setting up the tent in the rain. AND this resort that probably uses the crap out of my water tank neighbor has a breakfast buffet tomorrow morning. I wasn't planning on splurging, but considering the whole ""embrace the suck"" thing, I figured unlimited biscuits and gravy might be an alright start. And anyway, the birds are still chirping and I'm warm in my sleeping bag and what the hell? I guess still like it out here, even with the suck. But maybe ask me again tomorrow night....","Hazeltop Mountain Campsite

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616143,"It rained for most of the night last night, but did stop for a bit this morning. Long enough to get up and packed and head down to the lodge for breakfast. I walked in at the same time as another hiker and the host asked me if I wanted a table for two. ""Oh! No, just for one please."" The hiker behind me asked me if I'd like to join him and his friends. I was happy for the company. He and his two friends are thru hiking together and getting some major mileage.... 30 plus miles a day! I don't think I'd want to hike that much even if I could, but it was great to share a table with them and hear their stories. They'll be way past me for the rest of my trip, which is a bit of  a theme with the shorter miles that I prefer. I meet lots of hikers who are pushing 30 mile days, so it's always a passing conversation. It can get lonely, but I'm kind of ok with it. Part of what Iove so much about hiking is the solitude. I like having people around, but also, I like not seeing them. And not having to talk to them.... Unless I want to. 
After breakfast, the day sucked as expected. It rained nonstop the entire day. It's still raining now, actually, and hasn't even begun to slow down. (not great considering how badly I have to pee...) 
My shoes got soaked almost immediately, and the rest of me followed soon after. Even with rain gear, the condensation makes its way into every layer I've got on. I did encounter two really great moments of trail magic, though, which made the hike more tolerable. 
The first was at a picnic pavilion that I ducked into to escape the rain and call my parents (my spot beacon died and I thought they'd probably be worried). There were no other humans (what luck!), but there were the remnants of a fire still smoldering in the fireplace. With a little poking and stoking, I got it up and running again. It was a wonderful surprise to get to warm up and dry out, even just for a half hour or so.
The second bit of magic came from Mother Nature herself. On my last climb of the day, as I was soaked to the bone and freezing, it started to rain harder. I looked up to the sky and muttered a few unsavory words and thought a moment about crying. (I mean, what the heck... no one would be able to tell anyway...) I stopped to pull out the map and see how much further I needed to go. When I looked up, there was a mother deer right in the middle of the trail, looking at me. We held eye contact for a few seconds before she looked into the woods ahead of her and wandered off. As I followed her with my eyes (I wasn't about to move a muscle...), I saw her fawn. Tiny, knobby, and covered in white spots. It was beautiful. When I started to walk again, mom spooked a bit and the fawn took that as her cue. She bounded into the woods and hid, waiting for mom to tell her it was safe again. What a sight! The experience held me over for the rest of my hike and carried me into the shelter.
After two cups of tea and a steaming bowl of ramen (and another tasty farm fresh butt nugget straight out the chicken), I'm all curled up in my sleeping bag, kind of dry and sort of warm.
Only problem is, I still have to pee... And it's still raining. 
And if I'm being completely honest, hiking kind of blows.","Skyland Campsite

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616144,"Today started rough. I woke up still cold and still wet. I was really just looking at the day as a job. Get up, get it done. I skipped my morning tea so that I didn't have to boil water and left the shelter as quickly as I could. At least it wasn't raining.
Until it was. Two minutes after I left the shelter, I had to stop and put on my raincoat. After that, the morning continued to be crap. More rain, more cold. But I was headed for a wayside that promised cheeseburgers and French fries and sodas.
I should have taken a picture of that bacon cheeseburger, because I'm certain that it couldn't have possibly have been as amazing as I remember. Basically, it was the best bacon cheeseburger I have ever had. No doubt. It was perfect. And the fries! Ugh the fries! So salty. So warm. So delicious. 
After the wayside, it didn't rain anymore (thank you, oh goddess of rain for your undeserved mercy!). I was still in a lot of pain, but happy to be able to put my hood down and actually look up from the trail from time to time.I arrived at the shelter decently early and was able to nab a good spot on the top platform. Theoretically, there are less mice up there... theoretically. As the evening approached, several hikers started to trickle in. I had briefly met some of them last night, though none of us were really in the mood to socialize. Some others were new faces to me, and we got to know one another over steaming pots of ramen and knorr sides. I made a few new ""best friends"" when I offered up my (very heavy, please eat as much as you want so I don't have to carry it) bag of dried fruit. The best way to a hiker's heart: free food. 
Tonight, the shelter is full of happy (despite the overall dampness) hikers laughing and telling stories and I'm reminded again that trail magic comes in all forms. I needed this camaraderie, this band of random people who all share one passion, to bring me back to a positive mindset. Tonight, I go to sleep next to 8 new friends and with a smile on my face. I take back the ""hiking blows"". It's actually pretty great.","Pass Mountain Shelter

Today was amazing. I woke up feeling incredible and that carried me into the first couple miles on the trail. Everything was still damp, but the rain had cleared and the clouds had finally broken. Direct sunlight at last! And views again!
With the promise of a hot shower and a cold pint of ice cream, I practically ran down the trail. My pace went from 2 miles an hour to 2.6 miles an hour, putting me in town nearly two hours before I expected! The trail itself was alright. More of the same terrain, the same trees, the same animals. I think that the fog adds something very distinct, and perhaps dramatic, to the woods that I wind up missing on clear days. But the miles flew by, and I spent the whole day with a smile on my face. In town, I resupplied on some much needed food... More ramen for dinners, more tuna for lunches. My friend Zorro and I grabbed some food at a local brewery and more (yes, more. Don't you judge me.) ice cream from a nearby scoop shop. Back at the hostel, I took a glorious shower and had the opportunity to hang all of my gear to dry. Here's hoping the rain holds off for the rest of this hike.

After a bit of a lazy breakfast and 20 minutes of poking my eyes out trying to get my contacts in, I was back on the trail... 2 hours later than normal. To say I was uncomfortable with my timing is an understatement. I had 10 miles to go and was looking at getting into the shelter at 330 IF I didn't stop for lunch. (I should clarify that I like to be in the shelter obnoxiously early. I'll get in at 3 and be the only person there for hours before anyone else shows up.) 
I started out moving pretty quickly (due to the previously mentioned fear of not being the first person in the shelter), but found a good pace that had me moving at about 2.5 miles per hour, about as fast as yesterday! At one point, I came across a ridge runner who asked where I was staying.
Me: I'm planning on Manassas Gap Shelter.Ridge Runner: Ah that's only 3.7 miles from here! You should push to Whiskey Hollow. It's much newer and clean. A really beautiful shelter.M: oh I don't know that I'll have another 5 miles in me.....RR: oh the terrain isn't bad and there's also a....

I'm telling you, 100% worth it.... Clean. Mouse free. Bug free. Doesn't even stink yet! I never want to leave. 
Seriously though, this shelter is the best that I've stayed in on the AT. Its beautiful. And I did 15 miles today, which is a lot for me! It also puts me in an interesting situation... I have to slow down. At my current rate, I'd get to Harper's Ferry a day early. Not great when you're trying to meet people... So tomorrow will be 8 miles.

So today was 8.3 miles. I slowed down as best as I could (I've found my pace and my body wasn't interested in slowing it down again.) I stopped more often to move bugs off the trail and look for birds in the trees. I even got to help out a bee (who I named Beebee, obviously) who had gotten too wet to fly and was having trouble drying off on the wet ground. I held her on my finger as she dried her wings and cleaned herself off. When she was ready, she flew off onto a nearby tree. What a treat!
I arrived in camp at 1:30 and got to setting everything up. Then I ate lunch. Then I ate dinner. Then I reorganized my food bag. And then I had absolutely nothing to do. So I built a fire! Which a downpour seemingly from nowhere promptly put out.... But have no fear, gentle reader! I whispered life back into her shortly after the rain subsided.
We got some trail magic in the form of a man carrying a backpack full of cold beer and soda. We spent some time chatting with him and swapping stories before he headed out. There weren't many of us at the shelter when he came by, but based on how many people waltzed into camp with a cold can of beer, it looks like he lightened his load quite a lot on his way back to his car.

I. Loved. It. The varying terrain was a great way to give different muscle groups a break. When I was climbing up, my back and knees had a bit of a break and when they took over for the downs, my calves and glutes got a chance to breathe. I know everyone complains about this section, but it was my favorite section yet!
Beyond the fantastic terrain, the trail was generally quiet. I stopped a few times to try (and fail) to spot birds in the trees, once to watch a deer munch on some undergrowth, and a couple of times just to take in the peace.
I got to the hostel early afternoon and spent some time stretching and showering and chatting with other hikers. Dinner was an entire frozen pizza and a pint of ice cream.

I keep saying this, but it's hard to explain what draws me back to the trail time after time, despite the bug bites and the rain and the blisters. Maybe it's the views or the challenge of pushing my body to the limits. Or maybe it's the inner peace that finds me when I'm in the woods alone. It may even be the community of people who I sleep next to in shelters and bunk with in hostels. The people who start the day as strangers but end it as friends. Maybe its a mix of all of those things. 
There was a point on this trip when I seriously contemplated whether or not I wanted to be hiking anymore. It was raining and I was cold. Hiking was a chore that day and I wasn't certain that I wanted to do it anymore after this trip. I think this happens a lot out on the trail because it is something that I am choosing, and so can easily be something that I stop choosing. I also don't think it's necessarily limited to people who are hiking. There are a million moments in a million lives that mirror that same feeling. But somehow, we get through those moments on the trail (or in life) and there always seems to be light on the other end. In my case, that light came in the form of fellow hikers and the community that they carry. 
What I'm trying to say is the trail can suck sometimes, but more often, it is beautifully flawed and perfect. It has this way of giving you exactly what you need when you need it.

The walk into Harper's ferry was quiet and easy(ish). The trail skirted along a ridge for most of the day until dropping steeply into town. After a long downward climb, I hit the long bridge that crosses the Shenandoah river. The water looked so good! If I didn't have people meeting me, I 100% would have jumped right in. Ah, but I had a deadline and a family waiting... After the river, the trail headed back into the woods on the other side with a steep (unexpected) climb. So close, yet so far! Finally, after a bit more up, down, up, down, I walked into downtown. Harper's Ferry is a tiny city tucked into the hills where two rivers meet. It's beautiful and full of history. Dad, mom, sister and I spent some time exploring and reading all of the plaques (so many plaques!). I had a lot of fun pointing out all of the thru hikers as they made their way across town. I'm sure my family loved it to.... 

We headed to the ATC Headquarters where I got my picture taken and was officially added to the AT class of 2019 section hikers. There, I spent some more time pointing out thru hikers to my family and hemming and hawing over the t-shirt options. Eventually, I picked up a few AT patches to add to my backpack once I finish each state, and we headed toward the hotel and a shower (Dad's actual loving words: ""Not gonna lie, you smell. Bad.""

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618458,"The plan for today was to take some time cleaning and packing in the morning, leave the apartment around noon, and catch the 1pm train to Port Jervis. After a nightmare about getting to camp too late and not being able to find a place to tent, I woke up VERY eager to get going. Which turned out to be a very good thing because I forgot to get fuel... I already had a planned stop at Walgreens for batteries and lighters, but fuel means I have to go all the way to rei. I did some quick math and figured out that if I get out of bed *right now*, I could *maybe*  get everything ready and out the door by 11. That would give me enough time to stop by Walgreens, go to REI, buy fuel, and head to Penn Station before my train. And I actually managed to do it! I walked out the door at 11:05.
From there, the trip was relatively uneventful. I watched my once crowded train slowly empty as people got off in more and more rural towns. They ran to embrace family members and loved ones who came to pick them up. They're probably headed toward barbecues and family reunions. It's fun to see the joy on their faces as they hop down the steps and pick out a familiar face in the parking lot. They look all at once excited and content. Just the way I feel.
The cab ride gave me a bit of a heart attack. Maybe not because he was driving fast, but because we were going SO SLOW. When he pulled up, nearly 30 minutes after I called for him (""yes no problem. We can take you there. Give him five minutes""), I was so confused. There was a woman in the passenger seat who jumped out of the car to open the trunk for me and another woman with her small child in the back seat. I waited a moment, thinking that the two in the back must have been getting a ride to the train, but they didn't move. 'Huh' I thought, as I climbed into the last available seat 'I don't remember ordering a ride share...' So it was that we first dropped off the very loud (almost certainly drunk) woman who paid no fare at the bar where she maybe works? Not sure on that one. Second, we dropped off the mom and daughter (who did pay a fare) at a playground. Finally (FINALLY) we were headed to the High Point State Park Headquarters where I was supposed to start this section. Unfortunately, that involved driving up a (rather long) hill at which point the driver informed me that his car doesn't like going up (rather long) hills. So we drove. Slowly. Up the rather long hill. As we ambled along, I could feel every inch of muscle in my body tighten up. JUST GET ME IN THE WOODS NOW.
The trail is as pretty as I remember from my previous section through New Jersey. I only had a little under two miles to do. Some of it was partially exposed as it skirted nearby the highest point in New Jersey, so I was happy to have waited until after he hottest part of the day to start.
In camp, I came across a group of guys who I spent a night with in Virginia. It's been a couple of weeks, and they're still trekking! I'm hoping that maybe this means I'll run into a few other friends as well. 
It's not supposed to rain tonight, so I've folded the top of my rainfly back so I can lay in bed and watch the stars. 
Tonight, I sleep with the lightning bugs, to the sound of sleepy birds and distant fireworks. 
Tomorrow, I walk.","NYC

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618459,"Holy crap, the stars last night! I left my rainfly folded back so that I could see out of my tent, and got a beautiful show every time I woke up. It was so beautiful! Likely, I'll try to do the same tonight.
The trail today was mostly nice and flat. After an hour and a bit of walking, I came across a small pond surrounded by tall grasslands. 'The perfect chance to try out my new binoculars! (Thanks mom and dad!)
The pond was teeming with life! Mostly, red winged black birds. They seemed mostly disinterested in me, which was perfect. I got the opportunity to really be a fly on the wall (or blade of grass?). I also got to watch two cardinals in the midst of mating dance; the female generally avoiding eye contact, the male doing his best to look as fluffy and colorful as possible.
After a short break at the pond I headed on to ""secret shelter"", a privately owned cabin with outlets, a well, an outdoor shower, and a donkey! The donkey was friendly initially, but quickly turned to pushy when he realized that I had food. I had to go into the cabin and close the door just to eat in peace! After a couple of selfies, of course...
After I said goodbye to the donkey, it was time to push the last seven miles to the shelter. At about mile 5, the trail walked through the Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge. It was the most wildlife I have seen on the trail! Without even stopping and really searching, I found geese, ducks, a swan (with babies!!), a heron, six (six!) egrets, huge fish leaping into the air to catch bugs, and a beaver. There is so much more there to see, I'm sure. Without a doubt, I'll be returning some day to sit and watch the sun set on all of the creatures. For today, though, I had a huge long climb, and I was flirting with heat exhaustion. 
And here is where I made a giant mistake.
Right at the bottom of a steep .4 mile climb, there was a water source slightly off the trail. I pushed right on past, knowing that I had enough water to get to the shelter. Except that was the closest water source to the shelter. The shelter has NO WATER which I would have known if I had bothered to read my guidebook. When I finally made it to the shelter, I was so exhausted from the climb and the heat that I could barely set my tent up. I laid out the tent, took a break, staked the tent, took a break, set up the poles, took a break, and I was spent. I was out of water and having trouble thinking through a simple task. I was very worried about heat stroke. So I called dad. As I lay in the tent, explaining my situation, he was able to listen to me talk and confirm that I was successfully making full sentences (a very good sign for not having heat stroke). He also gave me a bit of a pep talk and got me moving enough to go back down and get some water. When I got to the spigot, I was so relieved. I filled my bags and my stomach and splashed my face and arms with the cool water. The hike back up to the shelter was painful, but doable after getting my body temperature back down to a comfortable level.
Now, I'm fed, cooled, watered, and exhausted. Man, does the sun take it out of me.
Tomorrow is another 11 miles to the next shelter. Thunder storms in the forecast. Hopefully they hold off.","High Point Shelter

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618460,"I did not sleep well last night at all... It was just too hot in my tent. So I was up and out quite early this morning. 
It got hot quick today. Within an hour, I was already getting a heat rash. BUT there was ice cream at mile 5, so I pushed on. The trail spent about a mile on the Pochuck Boardwalk, which (while being completely exposed and so, so hot) was absolutely beautiful. The boardwalk spans some wetlands that were full of lots of different birds. Perfect for a bird nerd like myself. If there wasn't ice cream in my future, I think I would have stayed there longer.
Around 11, I walked into the Heaven Hill Farm for an apple, a coke, and a big serving of moose tracks ice cream. The lunch of champions!
The sugar helped me drag my tired butt up what the locals call ""the stairway to heaven"" and what the thru hikers call something very different... The Stairway to Heaven is a one mile, 1000 foot climb to a view that is pretty but decidedly not heaven.
By the time I hit the vista, I was struggling. It was hot and humid. I was overheating and sweating bullets. The wind was not blowing. At all. It was miserable. 'Five more miles. I can do this. Five more miles.'
As I was heading up the stairway of hell to the mediocre view, there was the occasional rumble of thunder from behind me. It was teasing me. All I wanted was a shower. Something to cool me off and keep the bugs away. The rain could do that! But instead, it was just thundering. I looked to the sky. ""Oh dear rain Goddess, oh Goddess of storms. How I loathe yet adore you. Please bring me and this thirsty forest floor sustenance for we are not worthy but desperate! I promise I'll never complain about the rain again!""
Soon, I started hearing a few drops hitting the leaves above me, though none were making it to the ground. "" Stop teasing me!""
Then, with a crack of thunder that tore the sky in two, it started to pour. And I started to laugh, and then dance, and then sing my way through the rain all the way to camp. It has rained on and off since, but the air is cool, the bugs are (mostly) tolerable, and the inside of my tent is bone dry.
Tonight is my last night on the trail. Tomorrow, I walk five miles and catch a bus back to the city. And on Monday, I go back to work. Stupid work, always making me leave the woods....","Pochuck Mountain Shelter
",Wawayanda Shelter,"Jul 06, Sat",11.50
Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618465,"I woke up dry this morning, but my clothes did not. Everything was still soaked from that rain storm that I was so pumped about yesterday. I should have at least put on a rain coat... 
As I was waking up, dry and lazy in my tent, I realized that I might be able to catch the 10:15 bus instead of the 12:15. It was going to be close, but if I got up and moving (and skipped breakfast), I'd just make it. So I did, and then kept up a relatively quick pace for the next 4 miles. I probably missed a lot, but I did manage to catch sight of a few birds and salamanders. 
The bus was uncomfortable. Mostly because I knew I stunk. And because the bus stop was just on the side of a road in a residential section, I had to change out of my wet clothes and into my dry ones on the bus. Except that its a New Jersey Transit bus and it doesn't have bathrooms. Thank goodness I still haven't swapped out my full size camp towel for a half size! And thank goodness the bus was mostly empty and I could grab a seat away from everyone else for the stealth costume change.
Ahh, dry (and significantly less stinky) clothes! 
I, did at one point, ask one of my neighbors if they could smell me. They assured me that they couldn't, but I feel like they were maybe just being nice.

",NYC,"Jul 07, Sun",4.10
Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621267,"I woke up every hour last night to check the time. I was a kid again, waiting for Christmas morning to come. When the alarm finally went off at 6:30, I practically jumped out of bed! Ok, so maybe it was more of a sleepy stumble to the kitchen for caffeine... But inside, I was jumping for joy! Yay! Time to hike!! 
The 9:10 train from Grand Central got me to the AT station by 11:30 and I was on the trail shortly after. 
It would have been real nice if I had done even a single squat in the month since my last hike. Hell, even standing on the subway or, I don't know, taking the stairs would have been a good idea. Maybe even a salad would have been a smart move. But nooooo I was tiiiired and wanted to order chiinesee fooood. Well, thanks past Rachel. Hiking hurts again. 
My trail legs might be a thing of the past, but it didn't take the rest of me too long to fall back into old habits. It's quiet and the weather has been perfect today, and beyond the bugs (I forgot the bug spray! How did I forget the bug spray?!), everything is falling right into place. It's nice to be back. 
It's eerie to go from hundreds of people next to me on a train to being completely alone. 
I've been the only one at the shelter since I arrived, and that has me a bit nervous... I've been fighting a bit of a depressive state the last couple of weeks. While being alone in the woods is one of the best ways to work through my downswings, being alone is also the last thing I want when I'm down. Really, what I'm trying to say is ""waahhh don't make me deal with my feelings. Send me strangers so I can distract myself with conversation and not focus on making myself unsad."" 
Well, there are some squirrels throwing nuts at me so I guess I'm not completely alone....

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621268,"Today was so great! The weather was perfect, the trail was in fantastic condition (I'm impressed, Connecticut!), and I really got to enjoy everything that makes hiking so amazing. The air was still cool and crisp as I stepped onto the trail at the very late hour of 9:30. It was a comfortable hike up and over a small mountain. Four miles got me to the Ten Mile River. I stopped for lunch and a quick swim that turned into a short nap before hoping back on the trail. The water felt great and my leisurely lunch had me feeling ready to tackle just about anything. But the trail was kind, and the hike was easy. Just after crossing a road, I spotted a baby snapping turtle sunning and spent a few minutes on an impromptu photo shoot. When she had had enough, I moved along. Very shortly after, right before the biggest climb of the day, I was stopped again. This time, by a trail angel giving out bananas, oranges, ice cream sandwiches (gasp!) and ice cold sodas (gasp again!). I stood there chatting and eating and chatting and eating for a while. Oddessumus (??) is retired from the military and has thru hiked a few times. Now, he spends his summers driving his RV up and down the Appalachians bringing trail magic to wary hikers. His presence made my day and filled my stomach to the point of bursting. When the sugar from that coke hit me, I felt like I floated up that mountain!
On the way back down the other side, as I gallumfed along the trail not at all gracefully, I suddenly heard a rattle... Like a baby rattle, except scary and potentially deadly.... 'oh crap, I know that that is!' I stopped dead in my tracks and turned to see a six foot long rattle snake just outside of striking distance. Just in case, though, I stumbled (not so gracefully, again) backward and nearly fell over a rock. When I was balanced and the snake was staring (and probably laughing) at me, I pulled out my camera to get a couple of shots before he got bored and slithered away.
Beyond some frogs, a very curious chipmunk, and a huge bright green caterpillar, the trail was uneventful from there until the shelter. I was ok with that... One snake is a good number of snakes, I think.
The shelter tonight was a bit busier, so I had some good conversation while making dinner. A couple of deer visited the stream out front, and I listened to two of my favorite birds sing their night songs. Ugh, I'm such a happy camper!
Bedtime for now. Tomorrow is 10.6 miles and hopefully a meteor shower! ","Wiley Shelter

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621385,"Oh boy! Today was such a great day to be a bird nerd! Over the course of the day,  I saw a pilieated woodpecker, goldfinch, scarlet tanager, blue heron, and several egrets. I was in bird heaven! 
The morning started off with a long, difficult climb to a great view and a nice lunchtime view. Afterward, the trail took me down to the river where it followed alongside for a few miles. The trail in this section was flat and beautiful. It would have been an amazing couple of miles if it weren't for the bugs!Swarm doesn't feel like a strong enough word for what I experienced in those few miles. It was AWFUL. Luckily, though, they were the biting type. Instead of biting, these little guys like dive-bombing your eyes. And nose. And mouth. And ears. When I was packing for this hike, I took a moment with my bug net. I thought 'I always bring this thing and I never use it. At this point, its just been dead weight.' Usually, if i start feeling this way about a piece of gear, I bring it one more time to assess whether or not I actually do want to remove it from my pack list. THANK ALL OF THE GODS that I brought that bug net. Those few miles would have been unbearable without it. I'm never leaving that little net behind. Ever. 

After swimming through no-see-ums and watching some egrets fly up and down the river for a while, the trail turned back into the woods for the final climb of the day. I had read on my guide book app that water might be dry at the campsite that I was planning on staying with. I've done the 'well let me just get to the campsite. I'm sure there will be water there' thing before. Never again. There was a nice, cold, clean water source just before the mile long climb to the camp site, so I ""cameled up"". I filled all of my bottles and bladders so that I'd have enough water for dinner, breakfast, and the first part of tomorrow's hike. I wound up collecting over four liters of water. One liter of water weighs 2.2 pounds. At the end of a long day, at the base of a tough climb, I added NINE POUNDS to my pack. And I felt every single ounce. It did feel great, though, to be able to add those pounds and still make it up the mountain. 
A friend and I stayed up late in hopes of catching the meteor shower, but the clouds rolled in right as the sun set. Instead, we stayed out watching the moon rise and talking about nearly everything. It was a great way to end the day. I needed the conversation.

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621388,"Seriously. Just, like, even a single squat would have been grreeaat. Ugh.
Beyond the pain, the hike today was nice. Pretty scenery, but not much in the world of wildlife. A slight drizzle kept the forest relatively quiet.
I did, at one point, think I saw a baby bear, but it was just a squirrel. This turned out to be both a disappointment and a relief because boo no bear but also, yay no protective momma bear that views me as a potential threat! Yay not getting eaten!
I hit some trail magic early on in the day. A bottle of Poland spring that I chugged and a bag of goldfish that I saved for lunch. There was a fun squeeze between two large boulders that I had to do. (The pack was an added challenge) Lunch was at a shelter with two south bounders who were attempting to do the entire state of Connecticut in one day. They were on track to do it when I ran into them around noon, but they had been hiking since 3am and had run out of steam. More power to them! If I had woken up at 3am, I would have run out of steam around 4am!I got to my pick up spot for the hostel around 3:45 and called Dave, the hostel owner for a pick up. Within five minutes, I was in a car on the way to a shower! We made a quick pit stop by the grocery store for a resupply and then on to the hostel! The house is absolutely beautiful. Dave gave ne a quick rundown of the history while he showed me around. Built in the 1800's the house was initially a factory, making wagon parts. Later on, the building was converted to a car garage which was how Dave's dad bought it in 1940. Dave and his several siblings and parents moved into the top floor while his dad worked on renovating the house. Now, the ground floor is a kitchen, living room, and dining room, but when Dave was a kid, he and his siblings had huge hockey games in the very room I was sitting in! It was such a treat to wander around this piece of history. 
I'm happy to be indoors for tonight. Having clean laundry and cold soda is always a welcome respite from the discomforts of hiking, but I'm already planning out tomorrow. There is a cat here, though so I may just stay a few more days....","Silver Hill Campsite

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621389,"Hanta yo hostel to hanta yo hostel, 11.7 mi, slack packed
Anyone who knows me at all knows how important I find having a plan. I've never been particularly good at ""winging it"" or even ""going with the flow"". I know that this is a character flaw more often than it is an asset, and I've made a lot of strides in the last year or so toward being a more flexible person. That's probably why today was difficult, but not impossible.
I woke up a lot last night. My bed was uncomfortable, I was having nightmares, my body was achy. When this morning came, I was exhausted, in pain, and not at all in the right mind-frame to hike 12 miles. 
I was angry with myself for overestimating how many miles I could do. I was frustrated that I wasn't prepared for the challenge. I had thought that I could blast through this week like I have all my other hikes this summer, but I was wrong. Multiple high mile days back to back have broken me down too quickly. It's difficult for me to admit that I've taken on more than I can handle.
I think that if I didn't have such a strict deadline for getting these miles done, I wouldn't have hiked today. I would have hung around and let my body rest. But I didn't have that option. I have to be on a bus back to NYC on Friday, and there are 30 miles to walk between here and there. So I had to hike. Or I had to give up. I had to make a new plan.
I found an alright alternative between the all or nothing choices in slack-packing. Slack-packing is a term for when someone shuttles your bag down the trail for you so that you can hike miles without all of the weight on your back. It can also refer to what I did, which was to go out and day hike a large section and then stay a second night in the hostel. 
Dave dropped me off at the parking lot where he picked me up from yesterday around 9am. From there, I hiked 11 miles without the weight of my full pack which let me get my miles in without adding even more pressure on my body. It was a good compromise between pushing myself (perhaps too far), and giving up on my goal. I did get to enjoy some good views and saw some wildlife... Lots of birds, a deer, and some new flowers. Afterward, I came back to the hostel and relaxed with some TV, this amazing cat (no one tell my cats I'm cheating on them!) and dinner. Tonight, I'm set up for a good 10 hours of sleep and a bit of a lazy morning tomorrow. I'll have 11 miles to do, but I feel confident that I'll be ready to tackle them. Tomorrow will be my last night on this section before I head back to the city for a week. I'll be sad as always, but I'll be so very happy to be done with Connecticut, its incessant bugs and these deceptively difficult mountains.","Hanta Yo Hostel, Lakeville CT
",Lion's Head Trail Parking Lot,"Aug 14, Wed",11.70
Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621390,"The slack-packing yesterday felt amazing, and since I had paid for it already, I figured I'd do it again today. This time, Dave brought my pack to me instead of bringing me back to the hostel. The hike was beautiful, but very strenuous. I was grateful to have less weight to drag over the three mountains I climbed. As I crossed into Massachusetts, the most amazing thing happened! The bugs STAYED IN CONNECTICUT. I kid you not. They were dive-bombing me all morning, and when I crossed the border (which is nothing more than a sign nailed to a tree in the middle of the woods), they stopped in their little buggy tracks!  I like you already, Massachusetts!  Tonight is my last night on the trail, but I don't feel the way I usually do at the end a hike. I'm ready to leave. I'm ready to go home and sleep in my bed and let my body recover. This week has had it's ups for sure, but it also had some new low points. It's hard to be out here alone because I'm forced to face myself in ways that I don't have to when I'm in the bustle of the city. It's easy to distract myself at home, but out here, the silence can be deafening. 
I've been unhappy with this section for multiple reasons; some of which are myself, some are outside my control. Connecticut certainly hasn't been my favorite state... Lots of bugs, deceptively difficult climbs with less than rewarding views, dried up stream beds, minimal wildlife.
What has made this section truly uncomfortable for me, though, is myself. I got used to hiking with the thru-hiker bubble. It's a lot easier to go through less than ideal terrain or eat your weight in bugs when you can laugh about it with someone at the end of the day. I haven't spent the night alone yet (though it's looking like that might happen tonight...), but the population of the trail had declined drastically. Where a shelter once was packed to the gills, now there's just one person in it. A lot of the people that I do see are heading in the other direction or hiking way too many miles for me to keep up. So even the people that I am interacting with are gone just as quickly as they appeared. When I stepped back out here seven days ago, I was expecting the same experience that I had in the Shenandoahs in June. So when it wasn't that, I had a lot of time adjusting. Really, I don't know that I did adjust. I need to remember how to enjoy this alone. 
I also pushed myself much harder than I should have physically. My knees and back are in constant pain in a way that I haven't felt yet this season. I shouldn't have expected to be able to hike so many big mile days back to back like I did without any training ahead of time.
There were a lot of really great things, too, though. I spotted some beautiful birds, identified some new plants, stood on the tallest mountain in Connecticut, met a rattlesnake for the first time, and had some good conversations with some very interesting people. I also successfully tried out some new gear that I'm very excited about. Most importantly, I think, I learned some new things about myself. I'll be leaving happily tomorrow, but only so that I can heal, regroup, and head right back out next week.","Lion's Head Trail

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621402,"Today was a nice walk. The weather was lovely, and the trail was easy. I focused on savoring my time on the trail; something that I really forgot to do this week. I spent a lot of time stopping at views and smelling flowers and sitting next to ponds. I even took some time to feed goldenrod to some cows across the fence. It was a great way to finish off this section. When I got to the road into Great Barrington, I tried to get a cab which proved impossible. I decided to walk the two miles to the hotel where my bus would pick me up. A short distance down the road, though, I came across Fiddlehead's Grille. I decided to pop in to get out of the heat and maybe have a cold drink. When I stepped up to the porch, there was already another backpack sitting in the grass. Yay! Another hiker! I sat down at the bar next to Lunchbox, who I had met on the trail earlier in the day. We chatted over food and beers for a good hour. I was happy to hear about his thru-hike. When we settled up and headed out, he was able to get a car into town and let me join for the mile or so to my bus stop. The bus picks up and drops off right in front of a days inn, so when I head out again in a week, I'll catch it back to this same spot and stay in the hotel before heading out the following morning.

","Great Barrington, MA","Aug 16, Fri",8
Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622489,"I spent this past week at home thinking about how my last hike went and what I wanted to change. I've always done well with a regimented schedule, and I wonder if it would be a good approach to my hiking style. Normally, I look at my day as ""here's where I am and here's where I'm camping tonight and so here's how many miles I have left"". This is fine and has tended to work in the past, but I'm wondering if planning in smaller chunks might help me enjoy the entire day better instead of just the highlights and camp. So with this trip, I'm going to plan to stop a bit more. Every two hours or so and definitely at every overlook or lake or river or otherwise pretty place.
Coming out of town today, I only had a little over 6 miles to hike, so I made a point to spend some extra time before getting on the trail... I slept in as late as possible and checked out of the hotel at the very last minute. Then, took a walk into town for some tea and a hand pie, then came back to the hotel to get my pack. I sat in the sun and read for about 40 minutes before catching a cab to a restaurant for a beer and a huge salad. The restaurant (Fiddlehead Grille... VERY good. Highly recommended.) is only a short walk to the trail so I was able to head out right after paying my bill. 
I left the restaurant at 1:30, and immediately ran into a couple of trail angels giving out fresh veggies. After a chat I took some peppers and cherry tomatoes, and started walking. It was 2 by the time I finally started hiking. BUT, I only had 3 hours of walking to get to camp, so I was NOT. GOING. TO. WORRY. ABOUT. IT....
I did alright taking my time and not rushing to be the first person at the shelter, but I still didn't convince myself to stop and take a break. Baby steps.
There was one other person here when I walked in at 5:30, and he had already snagged the good tent spot with the view. I wandered over to say hi and scope out other tent spots. Before I barely got ""Hi, how's it going?"" out of my mouth, I knew how long he's been out, how many miles he averages, why he switched to a bigger tent recently, how his visit with his wife went this weekend, and how many children he has. I did not, however, get his trail name which is fine because I'd still wind up calling him Chatty Charles in my head anyway. Yeesh! Oh, and before you get all ""But MOoOose... Maybe he's just lonely being on the trail for so long alone and just wants to chat with someone!"" let me just go ahead and tell you what else he told me. After going over how many calories he eats per day (un-prompted, I'll add), he told me that I prefer having someone else in the vicinity while I'm camping because I'm a woman. Then, he said one of my very least favorite things that someone out here can say. ""Oh, these aren't mountains. These are just hills! If you want mountains you need to go to..."" I tuned him out after that. Guess I'll just have to go on thinking that we've been hiking mountains this whole time. Hike your own hike, Chatty Charles. 
So I decided to head back and set up near the shelter (and away from Mr. ""you're a woman and thus more easily frightened"" Charles). After a while, three more people had filtered in... Two rock climbers who are hitting the cliffs nearby tomorrow morning, and a nobo thru hiker. 
Dinner was chili ramen and I added in the pepper from the trail angels. I had also.... acquired.... A couple ears of sweet corn a field that the trail passed through today, so I tossed that in as well. Yum! There was a fire and lots of chatting, and I managed to stay up way past my normal bedtime. This means that I'll probably sleep in a bit later tomorrow which is 100% the goal.
Tomorrow is 12 miles, but also, a pond, a few creeks and streams, a view or two, and (if I've done it right) another late bedtime. Here's to changing what doesn't work and finding what does!","Great Barrington, MA

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622490,"The slowing down thing was tough but oh so rewarding!  My morning started pretty slow... I woke up around 8 and had my first cup of tea. Then I hung around camp for a bit and started to think about breaking down camp... Then I had my second cup of tea... Then started to break down camp. Then had a little tea break to watch a bird looking for worms... Then finished breaking down... Then did some yoga and light core exercising... by the time I was ready to go it was 10 a.m.
A bit of elevation lost and then a bit of elevation gain got me to my first stop of the day, Benedict Pond. I set up for lunch on a little rock overlooking the pond and watched as a few people floated by on paddle boards and canoes. I promise myself an hour break, so after eating I spent a bit of extra time just enjoying the silence. A heron flew down and spent some time grooming itself followed by some hunting. It was treat to get to watch him. Something I would have missed if I was trying to hike faster and get to the shelter sooner.
After another hour or so of hiking, I took another break at a beaver pond and watch a lazy Beaver survey his land (or water, i guess?) before diving underwater for snacks. There were tons of birds, too. Some diving into the water to catch bugs and others playing games with one another in the trees.
When I was down to my last few miles, I reassessed. I was well over an hour behind my normal time, but beyond happier than I normally am after so many miles. I actually managed to walk into camp with a smile on my face!
Of course, getting the camp at 6 p.m. has its disadvantages... There's a group of college kids here who are respectful if not a little loud. They had commandeered the picnic table so I had to cook elsewhere. Not a huge deal, but hiking etiquette would have had them making room without my even prompting. Now they've made a fire and I've retired to my tent. They're currently talking loudly and I'm currently grumbling... Then again it's only 8:45. Still though, get off my lawn you ne're-do-wells!
I remember doing a similar program when I was entering college... I'll bet we were a bit louder...
For now, I go to bed happy, mindful, and ready for another meditative day tomorrow.","Tom Leonard Shelter

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622491,"Well. I brought the wrong sleeping bag for this trip. I know this now... Or rather, I should have brought a sleeping bag at all... My 40 degree quilt and ""20 degree liner"" were not nearly warm enough last night. I wish I had a thermometer with me so I could have measured exactly what the temperature was. All I know is it was COLD. I woke up several times. A couple of times, I was actually shivering! (Though, there was a pack of coyotes howling awfully close. So perhaps I was shaking for other reasons...) Really, though. I was dreaming about nothing but hot coffee. After I put my winter hat and puffy on, I was at least warm enough to sleep, but tonight, I think I'll also have some thick socks on stand-by. The college kids were sleeping outside last night. And they were happy to be awake this morning... What is their secret?! Proper sleep systems for the time of year I suppose... 
Another lazy morning this morning. Out by 10 and on my way to what promised to be a beautiful cabin. With only 10 miles to do, I was feeling pretty good.
I saw a coyote on the trail just after leaving (well, he was running away from me so I guess technically I saw a coyote butt...) Another first! Later on, I came across moose poop. I didn't know they came all the way down to Massachusetts! Oh, now I reeeally want to see a moose! (But I'll take a bear or porcupine, Mother Nature. Really whichever of those works best for you...) 
Late morning, I came across a trail stand selling sodas and snacks. I grabbed a cold root beer to go. I had big plans to have it at my lunch stop. 
Lunch was tuna (and that still cold root beer!) by a secluded beaver pond. Dragonflies danced in the grass around me. A falcon stopped by, surveying. He landed on a branch and we locked eyes for a moment. 
The next five miles flew by as I pushed to get to the cabin. I knew that there would be some good swimming at the lake and wanted to get there before the sun went down. Five was the goal and I beat it by 30 minutes! 
The Upper Goose Pond Cabin is beautiful! There are mattresses on the beds and they make pancakes in the morning. A hikers dream! There are canoes that you can take out, but I think I'll wait until tomorrow for that. With only 9 miles to go tomorrow, I'm going to give the caretaker a hand with some chores and then go for a swim. I am very much looking forward to another relaxing day. 
I've been feeling rather poetic or whatever lately, so I started writing down things that came to mind. They aren't good, they're here for your viewing pleasure: 
PerfectionI saw four peopleFew words were shared between usAh! A perfect day.
Cicadas Do we know why the cicada screams?Is it for love?Or maybe as science tells usFor lust?Or perhaps it's something else entirely. Maybe, Like the hiker who speaks when there's no one around to hear, simply to remind himself that he can.","Shaker Campsite
",Upper Goose Pond Cabin,"Aug 26, Mon",10
Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622492,"I had a short day planned for today which turned out to be the right move because the cabin at Upper Goose Pond was incredible! I slept (mostly) like a baby despite mister Snorey McSnore-face in the bunk near mine. I am so happy that I thought to download a white noise playlist! I had chatted with the caretaker last night and told her that I'd happily wait to have pancakes until last since I was expecting to spend some extra time at the pond, so I slept in until 8. When I woke up, everyone had vacated the bunkhouse. I stumbled downstairs just in time for final call on the pancakes. They were exactly what this hiker needed! Afterward, I helped Motorcycle Mama clean up a bit by wiping down the beds.
Once chores were done, I took a canoe out on the pond. It was one of the most serene experiences I've ever had. I was alone, surrounded by trees and water. The forest was quiet and the air was calm. All I could hear was a gentle lapping of water against the bottom of the boat. If I could, I would not have left that cabin all day. BUT, I have a friend meeting me in a few days and I don't think he'd be too happy about me being a day late...
So by noon, I was on my way, quite reluctantly. The hike was easy and mostly uneventful. Stopped for a quick snack at another, smaller, much less exciting pond, passed a few beaver ponds where I watched some ducks swim around. Saw a frog and took way too many pictures of him. 
Now, I'm at the shelter, much more exhausted than I should be (I guess relaxing half the day makes me sleepy?). I'm going into town tomorrow, so I want to get an early start in the morning. I figured sleeping in the shelter would help me get up and out earlier, but the mosquitoes are eating me alive. I think they've evolved and actually like deet now. Maybe it's like a spice or condiment. Gives the blood an exotic flair?
So hopefully, if I'm not anemic by tomorrow morning, I'll be walking by 830/9, and in town by 3/330. Can't wait for that soda, shower, and central air!","Upper Goose Pond Cabin
",October Mountain Shelter,"Aug 27, Tue",8.80
Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622493,"Today was a quick one as they normally are when I'm headed into town. The promise of a shower and some fresh food carried me over the mountains and through the woods to Dalton, MA. I did take some time to stop at a few ponds and overlooks for snacks, though I skipped lunch in anticipation of a large pizza in town. 
I got into town around 3 and walked straight to the Cumberland Farms for a cold soda and a banana. Then, it was off to my hotel to get checked in. The trail walks for about a mile or so through the town along sidewalks. The concrete can be really rough on your back and feet when you've got a full pack, so I figured I'd go ahead a knock out that mile or so while I could do it without an extra 40 pounds. Once I was all checked in, I called a local shuttle driver to drive me up the road to where the trail reenters the woods on the north end of town. From there, I walked back into town along the AT route and grabbed a small resupply at a gas station. Then, it was ice cream, laundry, shower, ice cream, pizza, beer, pack, tv, more pizza, ice cream, journal, and now sleep. Looking forward to sleep in a real bed tonight, but looking more forward to being back in the dirt tomorrow. 
Oh, and here's some artsy fartsy thing that popped into my head when the wind blew some dead pine needles out of the trees over me. Enjoy. 
The wind blows above and something sparkles as it falls from the sky, landing on the ground around me. It sounds like rain, but it's not. It is only the wind coaxing the spruce to relinquish its spent needles to the forest floor.","October Mountain Shelter

Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622494,"I woke up this morning with a stomach ache, but that's kind of par for the course for me in trail towns. I always feel a little off until I'm back in my natural habitat, I mean the woods... (Also, I'm slightly lactose-intolerant, so my stomach had some feeling about all that ice cream...)  The second I was back on trail, most of that pain went away. Which is good. Because I had 12 miles to do.
This morning is one of my favorite kinds of forest, and one that I haven't seen much this season due to my very good weather luck. The rain last night brought in fog that lifted off the forest floor in wisps. It danced in the sun, angled steeply as it rose through the trees. Everything felt at once dreamy and alive. Sleepy and expectant. It reminded me so much of Vermont that I started dreaming about re-hiking the Long Trail. Hmmm... Maybe one day...
The hike was pretty smooth for the first part of the day. I stopped about 2 hours in for a snack break next to a boggy pond. Then it was on to Cheshire Cobble for a lunch time view. I figured I'd pack out a salad, and was very happy with that choice. I also chatted with a couple of women who gave me some blueberries (""Do you want some blubes??"" ""yes. Yes I think I would love some blubes, thank you!"") They  offered to take my trash as well. So nice!
Cheshire Cobble is a large marble ledge sticking out of the mountainside overlooking Cheshire, MA. It gave me a unique vantage point to see where the rest of my day would take me. The trail was headed into Cheshire and up into the mountains on the other side of town before climbing Mount Greylock. Using the map and landmarks such as fields and houses, I was able to trace the trail nearly all the way to the shelter ""Hi, future Rachel!""). It was even cooler to be able to look back after climbing out of Cheshire to see a big marble slab jutting out of the mountain behind me. (""I was just there! Hi past Rachel!"")
The last six miles of the day sped by. I did a good job of keeping correct form and taking appropriate breaks, so my body held up really well with minimal pain. I could have (and really thought about) pushed another 3 miles to climb Greylock tonight. There's a hiker hostel at the top with $35 bunks and showers. Considering how many college freshmen are at this campsite, part of me is wishing I had... BUT my tent is already set up and now I'm full of Mac and cheese. So looks like I'm staying here!
Tomorrow is my last day on trail for this section, and possibly this season. It's been a bit of a roller-coaster (sometimes literally) of hiking and outdoorsing this year, and while I'll be sad if this is it, I have so much to look forward to in 2020. So many miles! So little time! 
For tonight though, I'm falling to sleep to the sweet, sweet (read: not at all sweet) sounds of ukulele and 10 different 18 year old voices singing Jason Mraz. I have never begged for a down pour so hard in my life....I'm looking forward to an early summit tomorrow followed by a relaxing 9 miles to finish out Massachusetts. The last night in the woods is always so bittersweet (but mostly bitter tonight... I hate children.)","Dalton, MA
",Mark Noepel Shelter ,"Aug 29, Thu",12.30
Moose Snoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622506,"The children were up until 11pm last night. I get exposing kids to nature, and I think these programs are great. However, someone needs to teach these kids some shelter etiquette. Groups don't take up entire shelters, they have to tent, and hiker midnight is 10pm. Which, my sweet youths, means NO UKULELES AFTER 8PM DON'T MAKE ME CALL YOUR MOMS. 
But that wasn't the only thing that kept me up last night. 
It was 1:30 AM when I heard the first scream. The children were finally done with their Jason Mraz concert and had quieted down. I had just fallen asleep a few hours ago. The scream was blood curdling and loud. If I had ever heard someone getting murdered in the woods, it was now. I lay still, unsure if I had actually heard the scream or if it had been a dream. Then again, it sounded like she was just outside my tent a little up the hill. The scream rose from a guttural moan to an all out high pitched squeal. As I reached up for my headlamp, preparing myself to get out of my tent and face the demon, I heard it. Two low ""who... who"". 
Have you ever heard a screech owl? No? Go google it. I'll wait. 
It was the single scariest thing I have ever heard in the woods. After I put two and two together, though, and knew what was sitting just outside my tent, it was pretty cool. It only screeched one more time, but I was secretly hoping it would a couple more times... Just to make sure all those off-key kids were wiiide awake. 

The hike up to Greylock was wonderfully challenging, and the views were equally rewarding. I spent a bit of time wandering and taking pictures before I headed down the other side of the mountain. There was another short climb to do before a steep decline into Williamstown, MA where my friend Will (ahh so many Wills) was meeting me. We had big plans to hit the breweries on the southern end of the state, do some grilling, and eat our weight in maple creamies, dilly beans, and cheese. As luck would have it, he just happened to pull down the street that I was walking along shortly after I emerged from the woods! Not far behind me was a thru-hiker named Hemmingway who stayed with me, the kids, and the owl last night. He stopped by as Will and I were getting settled. We chatted for a bit and gave him a beer from the cooler (Beer: a thru hikers favorite food!). I said goodbye and wished Hemmingway a safe hike and we were off to the next journey!
The end of the season is likely here for me, and I'm not going to pretend that I'm at all happy about it. I haven't been off the trail, but I'm already feeling the post-woods blues. For now, though, its time to enjoy the best of Vermont with one of my favorite people, and start counting down the months until next spring.
