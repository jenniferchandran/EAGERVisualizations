Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606584,"I have been preparing for my final section hike of the A/T which will begin mid June, 2019 from Rutland, VT onto Katahdin, ME.  I plan to summit Katahdin about the 2nd week of August. I am 69 years old.Treadmill workouts and weightlifting has been my regimen for now but in a few weeks I will increase the regimen and include backpacking weight and longer hikes to simulate real conditions.  I have hiked from Georgia to Vermont and the variations in topography, severity of the various peaks and weather conditions which I had experienced have me bristling with confidence as I will approach the Whites of New Hampshire, the ""100 Mile Wilderness"" in Maine and on to Katahdin.  Planning is a fun yet focused part of this final section.  Trying to go lighter, planning logistics and menus, all enhanced from past experience I find quite enjoyable.Mike Koltonuk aka ""Bigfoot""",,"Katahdin, ME","Jan 24, Thu",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613960,"Hiked Loop and Oak trails at Nescopeck State Park, in NE PA. Trails are medium to strenuous near the top.  Ticks are a real problem in the NE.  
Did 8 miles in 3 1/2 hrs. with a 39 lb. pack averaging 2.2 mph.  For me at my age (69) I was OK with that.    This included lunch and a break.  Temp was 83F with high humidity.  As I improve my ""trail legs"" as the weeks advance I should set a faster pace. I'll be hiking mid June through mid August and will have completed the Trail.  This will be the 3rd of 3 large sections started in 2016. Each section averaged between 500 - 600 miles.  Most of PA was done in 2015 since I live in PA.
Gear tested was my new Osprey Atmos 65 pack which replaced an Atmos I had last year.  The replacement was free from Osprey due to a hip belt design defect which could not be repaired on the pack I sent back.  The pack is one of the best if not the best on the market.  Its not hyper-lightweight but makes up for it in awesome comfort, design and overall construction quality.  I also tested the Mossy Oak poly long sleeve with bug free and SPF 50 features.  No bugs and comfort in the heat & humidity with this long sleeve was excellent.",,View Entry,"May 19, Sun",0

Another difficult series of ups and downs. This section, i. E. Vermont to Maine I'm doing is certainly within itself the most difficult of all the others.","

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616849,"Let let me start off by saying that I've chosen shelters over tenting with us far because of the continual rain. Hopefully this will change in the near-term.  the highlight of the day included a fantastic Trail magic the grouping of all different kinds of food and beverage is provided by the parents of lobster who was with me at the last shelter. They were very gracious and very nice to be with. It was a beautiful day as well. Stayed with Power , No Break and Jefe.","Thistle Hill Shelter

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616851,A a wonderful though slightly strenuous hike out of Norwich crossed over the bridge over the Connecticut River into Hanover New Hampshire location for Dartmouth University. A beautiful campus awaited me there along with many facilities for practically anything you want very very pretty town and interested and interesting Lee the trail runs through Hanover and the Dartmouth campus and formally enter is it toward the back right Field section of their baseball field.  My legs were feeling quite well on this track as I arrived at tigger's tree house whereupon I met the owners Karen and Ralph and their dogs and stayed with Scepter from Cambridge Massachusetts and attending Harvard University for his PhD in IT.

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616852,Because because of the need for a rest during my first week of this difficult section I decided to take a zero on June 20th.

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617862,"This was a long difficult day for me with tough climbs. This, in light of my painful left knee finally showing signs of a bone on bone cartilage situation. Toughest part was climbs up Moose Mountain South and North peaks, the long descent down to Goose Pond Rd, back up to Holt's Ledge and then back down again to Trapper John shelter.","Tigger's Tree House
",Trapper John Shelter,"Jun 21, Fri",11
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617864,"For me this had been the toughest climb of all thus far this section hike....Smarts Mountain. The 2nd toughest... Killington Mt.  The day starts out early at 5:30am with a steep 4 mile descent off the Fire Warden's Cabin and down to the Grafton Turnpike.  This took a toll on my knee. Because of this I had to take frequent stops to ease the pain.Staying that night at the cabin was a woman from Southern England whose trial name I do not recall and another male thru hiker.  As I was about to leave the cabin for the days hike, another thru hiker came through the door of the cabin at about 7 am.  I asked if he'd just arrived for the day or a zero and he said he'd slept that previous night up in the Lookout Tower. Hard ti imagine since the tower shaked slightly with the strong winds that night.","Trapper John Shelter
",Fire Wardens Cabin,"Jun 22, Sat",6.90
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617865,"I considered slowing my pace to save my knee by stopping after 5 miles at the Hexacuba shelter.  I felt, however that I needed to hike my originally planned 12.8 miles to the Ore Hill Campsite in order to manage my food supply and keep a good pace for what was to come in the White Mountains.  After starting out at 7 am I made it to the campsite at 6:45pm and accomplished my goal, however at a cost. I clearly sensed from the knee pain that my hike the next day to Glencliff, NH would most likely be my last for this trip.When I got into camp I was greeted immediately by Tom from Brooklyn aka Slow Dog who I had been shadowing the last 3 days.  The ascent to and downhill from Mt Cube proved tough but I was grateful for no rain and an beautiful day.  Several other hikers had also set up camp at the site.  This site was very remote and difficult to find.  It was the site of a shelter that was destroyed by fire in 2011.  The night was free of rain and except for the ever-present bugs, it was restful. The only discomforting feeling that evening was sever cramps in both legs that lasted about a half hour. ","Fire Wardens Cabin

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617866,"This final day of my hike was nice weather wise, about 70F.  With my knee getting worse, the climb up to Mt Mist from Ore Hill was strenuous and the hike down off the mountain although in itself not a difficult descent, was painful.  I thought for a moment that I could zero an extra day at the Hikers Welcome Hostel in Glencliff but thought better of it by listening to my body, set up a game plan for next year, train for it, and come back rejuvenated and in a a much better position to actually enjoy the remaining 392 or so miles remaining to Kahtahdin.My game plan will consist of meeting with my primary and orthopedic doctors, take their recommendations for coping with the remaining miles including the most effective exercise/training approach. I will also for the first time most likely slack pack as much of the Whites as I can.  I've always been a purist when it comes to carrying your own weight but with the damage to my knee and inclined to avoid surgery, I think this is a wise as well as necessary option. Finally, I look deep and hard to shave at least 15lbs from my 44 lb pack load. It would feel great to get it down to 30 lbs or less including food and water.Can't say enough about the Hiker's Welcome Hostel. A great resting spot for hikers with all the basic amenities needed for a well deserved rest during what many contend is the toughest section on the AT.  My thanks to both Caretakers Rily ""Mumble"" Scaife and Trey ""Buffalo"" Holden for their assistance and enthusiasm.  Final thoughts....I knew my knee would likely be the only obstacle to finishing off the AT this section.  However, a 2 week hike/climb of 108 miles many would be proud of. So with that thought in mind as well as setting a confident future game plan, I'm very enthusiastic about next year's effort and wish all you fellow hikers peace and a great times ahead!","Ore Hill Campsite
