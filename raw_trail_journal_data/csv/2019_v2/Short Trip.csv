Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/489766,"After a couple of years away from the trail, we will now begin to plan a Thru-hike in 2018. We still have family support issues to resolve between now and then, but that is the hope and expectation as of now.As part of the prep, and to give back to the AT a bit, we have joined the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club. This has been my intent for a while and now that I am retired, I have the time to commit. We have been members of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy since 2003, and now want to assist locally as well. We particpated in our first trail maintenance day in early 2016 and really enjoyed the work and club members. We worked on the stretch between Spinger and Stover Creek to restore the footpath and repair drainage at a creek crossing. Fun and rewarding.We will also attended the ATC Biennial conference in Virginia, in July 2016. There, we will attend several workshops and participate in several hikes, including a 2 day slack-pack of the 'roller coaster.' So, for now it is early planning, increasing activity, and supporting the Trail as we work towards the 2018 Goal!",,Home,"Apr 20, Mon",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/489767,"Just a quick note to say we will tweak the gear we have today, which we are mostly OK with as a base. I suspect we will tweak and few items and work on weight as everyone does. I will add current items to the journal gear list and make updates as we test and find better choices. Right now we usually hit the trail with about 28 lbs, including 4 days food and 1 litre of water. Big 3 (pack, bag, tent) are under 9 lbs. with cold weather load.
UPDATE: After a couple of shakedown hikes and some edits on our gear, we are moving to smaller, lighter backpacks. REI Outlet had a good sale on the REI Flash packs so we picked up a Flash 58 for Breathless and I found a Mountainsmith Scream 55. We also picked up Therm-a-rest Prolite Plus pads. These will save a little weight and still be durable, warm and comfortable. once it warms, we will use Sea to Summit UL pads.",,Home,"Apr 21, Tue",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/489772,"You can read about my 1,000 plus miles of section hikes by selecting the 2009 journal in the left column. Good entries for the first couple of years and mileage for all. I hope to fill in the narrative a bit more. Breathless has completed about 350+ miles to date, mostly in Virginia.",,Home,"Apr 22, Wed",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502377,"We took a quick one night hike from Three Forks south to Spinger Mountain. This was our first hike in some time, so chance to see how our current gear is working a test the trail legs. We had a good time on the way and paused at Stover Creek shelter for a break and talk with two section hikers taking a break from college. Made reasonable time to Springer and set up for the evening. There were several other hikers at the shelter area, all in tents. We fixed dinner and soon to bed. We awoke early in the fog to have some coffee and a protein bar before breaking camp. We took time to walk up to the summit before heading back down to load up and head out. Made good time back to the car and home. This was a good way to get back in the groove and start to shakedown the gear. All worked well and we were pleased with weight and functionality. A few areas to consider for weight reduction and updates to newer gear, but all in all we are in good shape for now.",,Springer Mountain,"May 13, Wed",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516772,"Another short overnight shake down. Nice weathere and a good exercise of up/down for boots and legs. First 2 miles is up Rocky Mountain and back down again. Break and lunch at Cheese Factory site and then on to summit and over to Shelter. Gear all worked well. Met some folks from the UK doing a section and had a nice talk with another hiker about the Trail, gear and life. Tough on the outbound return trip the next day. Southbound Rocky Mountain is a bear! All in all a nice couple of days.",,Trey Mountain Shelter,"Jun 16, Tue",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517979,"We headed up to Damascus for a 45 mile section from Town to thre Hurricane Creek Campground. Originally we planned to make it to Atkins, 73 miles, but cut the hike short due to weather and some blister issues for Breathless. All the gear checked out and worked as expected. We had generall good weather, but a cold front moved in and together with the foot problems, prudence said we should stop early.
This is a great section with some terrific veiws, the Virgimia Creeper trail, and enough varied terrain to help check out boots and conditioning. We did well with 11-15 mile days through some significant ascents, rock, and scrambles.
Pack weights were under 30lbs. and we were pleased with the way we handled it all. We both have severals pairs of boots, so will continue to experiment to find the best pairs to use in 2017 and beyond.
This was a nice hike and it felt good to be out for more than one night.
On the way back to Atlanta we stopped at a campground in the GSMNP for a couple of nights of car camping. We have a new, large tent for this and wanted to check it out...worked well.",,Damascus to Hurricane Creek,"Oct 15, Thu",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517975,"Today I joined about 10 other members of the GATC and Benton McKay clubs to take a 1 day training course on trail maintenance. The class was sponsored by the Forest Service and included safety, construction techniques, water management, trail repair, etc. The weather was great and the group had a good time learning and walking portions of the DeSoto Falls trail to see both good and bad examples of trail work. I now have to go back to the club and share what I learned to spread the knowledge. Fun day!",,Trail Maintenance Training,"Nov 14, Sat",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517974,"So today we joined the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club, GATC, for a day of trail maintenance along the section between Blood Mountain and Neels Gap. We cleared water bars, built dips and reworked steps in several areas. It was a good day and fun to see friends in the club. The hiking was only 2 miles or so, but the work was good exercise and and a chance to revisit this area. We do maintenance every third saturday, so if you in Georgia, check out the club. In January we will be working to improve and add campsites to the Hawk Mountain area.",,Blood Mountain,"Nov 21, Sat",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517715,"Today I accepted a job as Ridge Runner for 2016! I will work the trail in Georgia, probably around the Hawk Mountain shelter. Training in February and then on the Trail March-June. Should be fun!!",,Home,"Nov 25, Wed",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519234,"We joined the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club for ' third saturday' trail maintenance. About 45 folks joined in to install new steps, clear out tent sites, and clear blowdowns. It was cold, but the worked warmed us up and it was a good day. Lance Creek is a camping area just before the section where bear cannisters are required, south of Blood Mountain. There are 4 or 5 cleared, framed tent sites and a good creek. Plus, there is an old forest road that makes for additional camping. This is a target area for people who do not want to use the cannisters as you can easily make it to Neels Gap from here in a day. For January, the club will beging to create about 30 new tent sites south of Hawk Mountain Shelter. Since Hawk is typcially the first night out for many thru-hikers, we need theee extra sites to reliee crowding and reduce impact at Hawk. A new privy will be added near the new sites and a creek is nearby. Eventually, tent camping will be closed around the current shelter where the area overused. The shelter holds 12, so if it is a busy day when you hike, think about using the new sites about a mile before...Other than that we continue to tweak the gear and try out various boot and sock combinations.",,Home,"Dec 19, Sat",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520773,"So I the ATC is telling me I will work three areas during the 2016 Ridge Runner season. As a roaming ridge runner, then near Hawk Mountain, and lastly at Springer. My time on the trail will be from Feb 25th throuh June 18th. Should be a fun time! The picture in this post was taken during a work trip where the GATC and ALDHA joined forces to get the work underway on the new tent sites and Privy. Ultimately there will be 30 sites, a new privy, and possibly some food storage boxes. There is also a good water source. All of this is south of the current Hawk Mountain Shelter and should be ready by March.Look me up if you are out there for practice hikes",,Ridge Runner Plans,"Jan 26, Tue",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552421,"So I worked as a Ridge Runner last year, in Georgia, from mid-Feb until early June. It was a great experience and I talked with hundreds of thru-hikers. I will be out there again this year, starting March 2nd. The thru-hike for me is still a goal, but need to care for elderly Mother for now and the Ridge Running is a great way to be on the AT while still close to home. Breathless retired this year, so will also be on the Trail as a GATC Trail Ambassador. See you out there.",,Ridge running again,"Dec 13, Tue",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553921,"I got to co-lead a Leave No Trace Trainer class a couple of weeks ago up at Springer Mountain/Stover Creek. Had a great time even with some cold temps.
And, Ridge Runner training starts 2/13 and I will be on trail starting 3/2. Looks like I be around Hawk Mountain initially. See you out there!
When I hit the trail in March my base weight will be just under 20lbs and I am good with that. Will continue to tweak, but like my kit and it peforms well for me.",,HOME,"Jan 29, Sun",0
Short Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554448,"Today we went out to the 1 mile section of the AT that we adopted for maintenance. The section starts at Three Forks and runs 0.9 miles up to Long Creek Falls. We cleared water bars, refreshed some blazes and removed a small blow-down. So, this section is ready for the season. 
We saw 3 or 4 thru-hikers and all were in high spirits as they hit the trail for their first or second day. Goodluck to them!
Tomorrow is a meeting to kick off the Trail Ambassador program in Georgia for the season. These are volunteers from the local trail club, GATC, who will be out on the trail during the Ridgerunner off days...usually Tuesday and Wednsday.
Then, on Monday I start the two week Ridgerunner training before heading out on the trail. Should be fun.",,Section Maintenance,"Feb 10, Fri",0
