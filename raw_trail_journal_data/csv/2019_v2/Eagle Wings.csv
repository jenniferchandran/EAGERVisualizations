Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600144,"I decided to submit my retirement papers back in April 2018 with a retirement date at the end of September 2018 and now my planning efforts have started in earnest.  I attended several classes through River Rock Outfitters in Fredericksburg, VA, REI, and various You-tube videos.  Slowly gathering gear and making plans.  More to follow on each of these topics as this journal develops.  I am tracking the AT class of 2018 and learning about my fellow travelers in 2019 on Facebook and Trail Journals.

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600467,"Recently I was inspired by the lyrics of the song called Dream Small by Josh Wilson.  The song speaks to how small acts of faith and kindness, such as singing a song about the Lord, a father choosing to spend time with family, visiting the widow down the street, etc; can be moments where we can change the world.  

The chorus lyrics say:
Dream small
Don't buy the lie you've got to do it all
Just let Jesus use you where you are
One day at a time
Live Well
Loving God and others as yourself
Find little ways where only you can help
With his great love
A tiny rock can make a giant fall
Dream small
So during my hike I hope to learn how to dream small.  I will focus on the small but special times on the trail, focus on one day at a time, help my fellow trail travelers, live well, and dream small.

DS:
As I leave my work career behind, i can look back with many fond memories.  I have developed many friendships throughout the years with my professional associates and I am happy to have shared our lives together.  We have prayed for each other and shared many joys, sorrows, victories, and losses.  At my retirement luncheon many friends showed up to help me celebrate my pending retirement.  My sincere thanks go out to: Peggy, Ronnie, Dena, Patrick M., George, Nancy, Danut, Patrick E., Amy, Pam, Mary, Jennifer, Todd, Darin, Terry, Andrea, and anyone I may have forgotten to mention.  Your gifts, awards, and kind words are greatly appreciated and will bring many fond memories of our times together.
As I look back on my work career I realize that many of the outcomes of work are not really that important, instead the journey and relationships shared during the process of work and living are much more important.",,View Entry,"Sep 28, Fri",0
Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604531,"Completed a 3.75 mile training hike today carrying a 15 pound pack.  I followed several trails within the Fredericksburg Quarry Trail System (www.fredtrails.org).  Not much elevation gain/loss but enough roots and rocks to test out the shoes, ankles, and knees.  Trails followed the Rappahannock River in Virginia which is a wonderful wild river.  I saw several squirrels and a bunch of deer tracks.  Weather was cloudy and in the 60's but no rain.  Along the river from the fall line in Fredericksburg, VA up to Carter's Run in Fauquier County, VA are remnants of the Rappahannock River Navigation System.  This was a series of dams and locks built between 1816 and 1849.  See Training Hike 2-4 photos showing one of these locks along the river.
DS:
I saw 4 bikers and runners on the trail during this outing.  I was surprised by one runner who came up from behind me and passed quickly, but as he passed he yelled out ""Training for the Appalachian Trail?""  I was surprised by this question since I only had a day pack on and not my full AT pack and I wondered how the person knew I was doing a training hike.  After a few moments I realized that the runner was in fact my regular physician (Dr. Cook) who is an avid hiker and runner.  I recently had a routine physical to get ready for the trail in March 2019 and we talked for several minutes on training and health issues to get ready for the AT.  I hadn't expected to see my doctor on the trail but this was his day off and it was nice that he recognized me and realized that I might be training for next year.",,Fredericksburg Quarry,"Oct 16, Tue",0

My son could not do the day hike but did join us at the campsite after 10:00 pm.  While he set up his tent, I got the fire going again.  We sat around the fire talking for about 40 min and had a great time.  It was wonderful to share some time around the campfire and it brought back many happy memories.  Thanks for joining us Brian!!!!",,Dragons Tooth,"Nov 10, Sat",5.40
Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605325,"I woke up to upper teen temperatures.  Quickly broke camp and went to a small gas station/store to get coffee and biscuits.  It was great to get some warm food inside our stomachs.  Our plan for the day was to locate cars at the base of Tinker Cliffs (at the Andy Lynn Trailhead) and then start our 14.5 mile day at the McAfee Knob parking lot.  The first 5 miles to McAfee Knob was a gradual but continuous uphill hike.  Views from the Knob were absolutely beautiful.  Bright clear skies, temps in the 40’s to 50’s through the day.  Followed the ridge line from McAfee Knob to Tinker Cliffs which was 5.5 miles away.  Unfortunately the ridge line had many roller coaster hills with several steep ascents to Tinker Cliffs.  I had to stop several times due to minor cramping in my quads.  Once at Tinker Cliffs our group (Joe, Drew, Brian, and myself) had a lite lunch and hot chocolate.  The final 4 mile descent to the parking lot was difficult.  This section was very hard on the knees but provided a good test of  how well my knee exercises were working.  I must report that my knees performed well but there is still plenty of room to improve.  After collecting our cars we drove to Salem, VA to enjoy a cold brew and wings at the local sports bar.  From there we departed ways to our respective homes.  The entire 2 day trip was full of fun, good conversation, beautiful views, and some hard work.  Lots of minor adjustments to make before the AT but a really great time.",,McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs,"Nov 11, Sun",14.50
Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607115,"14 days to go until I start my hike on the Appalachian Trail. My wife will drive me down to Amicalola Falls State Park where we will spend a few days together before I head north.  We plan to stop in southwest Virginia to visit our son and his family on the way to Georgia. We will arrive at the state park on Saturday evening and check in at the lodge.  On Sunday we will do the activities necessary to check in and then drive up to Springer Mountain together to check out the starting point. We will go back to the lodge for one final night and on Monday we will once again drive up to the mountain and say our good byes and the adventure begins.
I have spent most of January and February making final preparations with my gear and I am down to a base weight of 27 pounds without food and water. I think I have my rain and cold weather gear properly laid out so I will be comfortable during the hike.  I will post my gear on a lighterpack.com and provide a link on this journal. These past few days I’ve been working on my physical training by hiking with full pack load for 4-5 miles a day.  On off days I focus on cardio work and leg and knee exercises.  My daughter is a physical therapist and she has been helping me with some training ideas and also treating my left shoulder for a possible rotator cuff injury. She did dry needling on my shoulder a few days ago which was quite an experience.
The two week forecast for the next two weeks is rain and cold.  Hopefully when I get to GA the weather will break and there will be some dry time during my initial days of the trip.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Mon",0
Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607349,"Today was a very special day and hopefully one of many “Dreaming Small” days that I hope to have on the trail.  I will step out onto the trail in 8 days and so as this last week begins, I am starting to say good bye to friends and family as I come across them this week.  Today was my last day in my home church and I received several well wishes as I embark on my journey.  I had the opportunity to have lunch with a good hiking buddy who really helped me work through some of the excitement and anxiety I am dealing with about starting the hike.  We laughed and shared a few beers and talked about the upcoming trip.  My friend Joe really gave a lot of good advice and counsel during our lunch and I left out meeting is high spirits and eager anticipation.  Later in the day my family hosted a nice dinner get together to wish me well on my trip.  We had all my favorite foods: fried chicken, potatoes, green beans, bread, and wonderful oatmeal raisin cookies.  Throughout the meal we shared fond memories and I answered many questions about my plans, feelings, and thoughts about the upcoming trip.  After leaving dinner my wife and I went home and had several more conversations about the trip and what I was thinking about.
For me the knowledge that I have such a wonderful set of family and friends who are supporting me in this adventure is overwhelming.  I am grateful to have the support and prayers of these folks and I am also grateful to know that while I am off on my adventure, they will be together to support each other and help each other during my absence.  Thanks to the following Dreaming Small friends and family: Dave, Joe, King, Jason, Cat, Sharon, Chip, Jennifer, Tyler, Colin, Brooks, Reese, Sawyer, and last but definitely not least my wonderful wife Susan.
On Friday Susan and I will drive to Roanoke to see our son Brian and his family.  I am sure we will share another Dreaming Small event during our short stay overnight and then continue on to Amicalola Falls State Park on Saturday.
I know that I will also start meeting another trail family soon and to build new friendships with them.  Looking forward to the upcoming adventure.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Sun",0
Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607350,"I am sure all of the class of 2019 have been asked many questions from Family and Friends.  In the spirit of sharing, here are some of the answers to those questions from my planned adventure:
Q:  Why, Why, Why?  A: Too many reasons to give so my primary response is this is one of my bucket list items that I have thought about since I was a Boy Scout.Q:  Trip details?  A: Northbound direction (NOBO), starting at Springer Mountain, GA and ending (God willing) in Katahdin, ME.  Total miles: 2190.  How long: start in March and end in late Aug to mid Sep.Q:  How will you sleep?  A: I will be using a hammock and tarp as my primary system with trail shelters as a backup.  I don’t carry a tent anymore and I am comfortable sleeping on the ground under a tarp if there are no trees nearby to hang a hammock.  Plenty of flexibility for me I hope.Q:  What is your re-supply plan?  A:  I will primarily re-supply along the trail.  Since my home is in Virginia, I will trade out my winter gear for my summer gear when I come through the Roanoke Va area.  This should get me through the Va Grayson highlands which many say you may need your winter gear for cold nights.  I will trade out my summer gear for winter gear somewhere in VT/NH depending on weather conditions.  This will be probably my only planned re-supply event.Q:  What will I eat?  A:  The answer will depend on re-supply options but I can say that today it is very easy to find a wide variety of food items that are suitable for trail use with minimal preparation.  I have cruised enough stores to know that I can find just about anything I want if I look hard enough.  I once found bullion cubes made of cilantro in the local Walmart.  If i can find that then I can  probably find just about anything I want to take back to the trail.Q: Beer, Wine, or Whisky?  A:  The only answer is YES!!!.  Of course this really requires more than a one word answer so the longer answer is:  Beer - I prefer lager beer over ale’s but with the great craft brew industry I am ever expanding my palate.  Wine - in general not a big wine drinker but I do enjoy many dessert wines.  Always keeping my options open.  Whisky - First and foremost I love Single Malt Scotch.  My favorite comes from the Island of Islay in Scotland which produces the smokey/peaty varieties of scotch.  I spent a week in Islay back in 2017 and had a great time sampling over 27 different varieties.  I also enjoy a good Bourbon when it is available.Q: Boxers or Briefs?  A: Briefs.General item of interest: I will be using a Hiking Kilt this summer to see what that experience holds.  So my question to you is What does an AT hiker wear under his kilt?  A:  We will just have to wait and see.
Have fun and see you on the trail!",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Mon",0
Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607554,"Arrived at Amicalola Falls State Park last night and checked into the lodge for the weekend.  
Got up this morning to a cloudy day with temperatures in the low 40’s.  I registered at the Visitors Center as AT hiker #498 for 2019. The staff at the registration site were friendly and very informative.  The staff was kind enough to help me with a pack inspection which resulted in another 2.5 pound weight reduction.  Base weight w/o food and water is now 27 pounds.
During lunch rain and thunderstorms moved in for about 4 hours.  My wife and I attended several lectures at the AT hiker festival and met several thru hikers leaving today or tomorrow.  
Once the rain stopped my wife and I went to view Amicalola Falls.  I hiked the 600 steps to the top of the falls where my wife greeted me and then we returned to the lodge for a leisurely evening.
Tomorrow morning we follow several hikers to the parking lot on Springer Mountain and I will be dropped off to begin this grand adventure.
I want to express my deep gratitude and affection to my family and friends who have helped me get to this point.  Thank you all so very much!!!",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Sun",0

Left Barefoot Hills Hostel in high spirits being fed, warm, and good night sleep.  Started at Gooch Gap. Started with a little knee pain but the pain got worse as the day continued. Hiked 3.5 miles to Woody Gap and came across trail magic from a group called 12 tribes (commune group and some locals said was a cult).  I had lemon lentil soup tea bread cookies. Food was great!
Continued hike through Blood mountain wilderness . Stopped at Jarred Gap due to painful left knee and got a ride off mountain to Vogel state park and slept in cabin for the night to rest and get out of the cold (below 10 degrees predicted). 
Traveling with Paul and Elizabeth and Fred this is my mini trail family. We all decided to move in the morning to Mountain Crossing outfitter and take a zero day and rest our bodies and let the weather get warmer.

Took a zero day to rest and re-supply.  Moved from Vogel State Park to Blood Mountain Cabins at Neels Gap and did a resupply at Mountain Outfitters which is right on the trail.  Great selection of equipment and food for the next few days of hiking.  While there many hikers from our first few days came in and took rooms at the hostel for the evening.
I got a knee brace at the outfitters which is helping my knee along with my stretching exercises.  We plan to do 8 miles tomorrow.
Temperatures are getting warmer but rain moves in during mid morning.  40-50 degrees expected with 1/2-1 inch of rain through Sunday.
Our tramily went into town to get money and go to the food store for dinner. Pasta, bread, salad, and meatballs were shared tonight. 
Paul will hike with us tomorrow and leave the trail on Saturday to return to work.  The 3 of us left will continue on.   We wish Paul safe travels home. 
Early start expected in the morning.

3/8/19
Start Neels Gap 
End Neels Gap 
Taking a second day off (zero day) to give my knee some more time to recover.  Knee feeling better as time goes on.  Rain has moved in but temps moderating to the 50’s.  Rain expected to leave Sunday night. 
Plans for next 4 days of hiking are in place and food resupply complete.  Today has been great to catch up on blogs, post cards, and calls home. 
Reflections on past few days:
A. Trail life a bit harder then I first expected.  I didn’t have any problems with 8-10 mile days but with significant elevation changes the trail throws other challenges at you.  Key for me is to remain aware of my footing, only do one task at a time.  If hiking then stay focused on your footing.  If you need to make adjustments then stop and adjust then continue on.
B.  Stop and enjoy the views.  The pressure to keep moving is intense even if you are by yourself.  It takes a lot of effort to “slow down”.
C.  Take one day at a time.  I was surprised by how the day is affected by weather, food consumption, need for rest, and unexpected injuries.   I have good equipment, good plans, and good food.  The problem was after a night at 9 degrees and constant 15-20 mph winds even a 0 degree rated bag was barely adequate, the food I had wasn’t calorie rich enough, and my sleep was awful.  The following day was sunny but didn’t get above 25 degrees with 30 mph winds.  By the end of the day with rapidly dropping temps the thought of another night down to 0 degrees was mentally unbearable.  So we left trail for the night to get warm.  We found out later that trail runners were pulling hikers off the because of the extreme cold.  I guess we made a good choice.
D.  Trail family’s are real and wonderful!!!  Sharing expenses has allowed us to afford shuttles and cabin rooms at lower costs than hostels.  Also the developing friendships are unique.
Eager to get started tomorrow.","Neels Gap

Weather started off foggy and a slight drizzle.  Trail muddy but tolerable. My knee didn’t hurt for the first mile but pain started later.  Pushed through with stretches and slower pace.

Big climb up Rocky Mountain was really hard.  Knee held out ok but the going was slow.  At the top of the mountain I was passed by a couple walking their dog.  They were from Canada (town south of Toronto) and they come to the US regularly to do day hikes along the AT.  Today they were hiking from Unicoi Gap to Indian Grave Gap and back.  We talked for a while and at Indian Grave Gap we stopped for lunch.  They returned to Unicoi Gap and I continued to my second climb of the day up Tray Mountain.  About half way to the top it started to rain.  I put my rain gear on and continued to Tray Mountain Shelter to get out of the rain for a while.  I ate some food at the shelter and the rain stopped and I decided to continue 4 more mile to Sassafras Gap to camp for the night and make my hike into Dick's Creek Gap the next day shorter so I could get into town and clean up and re-supply.  Got to Sassafras Gap and ran into Fred and Elizabeth again.
At camp I met ""Olie"" from the United Kingdom.  This is his first time to the US and he was enjoying his time here.  I shared with him that I had been to the UK in 2017.  He seemed to enjoy the fact that I could directly relate to some of the places he lived in or had visited.  I wish him well with his hike.","Blue Mountain Shelter

From Powell Mountain I called the Budget Inn in Hiawassee, GA and made a reservation for a room for the night.  As a guest, they offered to send a shuttle to the trailhead to pick me up once I got to Dick's Creek Gap.  I arrived at the Gap at 1:25 and the shuttle showed up at 1:30 as promised and took me into town and the hotel.  I got to my room, took a long hot shower, dried out wet gear, did some laundry at the on-site facility, and got some food.  It was great to get clean and eat a non-trail meal.After discussions with my family, I decided to get off the trail for a few days to rest my knee again and to re-evaluate my gear.  I plan to go home for a few days and then continue the hike starting in VA.  More to follow on the next entry.","Sassafras Gap

DS:  It was a wonderful gesture that my lovely wife made by hiking to my campsite to see me off on my adventure.  This is the second time she has done this first in Ga and then today.  I am really lucky and thankful for her support. She returned to the car and was able to give another hiker coming to our camp a message that she had safely made it off the trail.","Thornton Gap

Woke to a beautiful sunrise and got an early start hiking.  With warmer temperatures the wildlife is starting to be noticeable.  I shared the privy this morning with a field mouse, I heard owls and woodpeckers in the night and morning, saw a squirrel, and several song birds.  During lunch one hiker who stayed at gravel springs shelter (my destination today) said several bears came into their camp looking for food last night.  I hope they move on before I get there today.  Not much is blooming yet but I did see some purple Trillium starting to bloom in the lower elevations.  
I met several flip flop hikers today all going South to Ga and then planning on flipping to ME and hiking to their starting point.
Around 1:30 today I lost my balance on a downhill slope and did a face plant into the rocks.  Nose bled pretty hard but I got the bleeding under control.  Got off trail to Skyline Drive and called 911.  Got connected to the park service who sent a ranger to pick me up and take me to an ambulance to take me into Luray Va to get checked out.
I was released from the Emergency Room with some antibiotics and some pain pills .  Nothing was broken just a bad nose bleed and a cut on my tongue that should heal without stitches.  My wife is picking me up at the ER and I will go home for a few days to rest and then try again to get back to hiking.  Perhaps the third time will be the charm.  By the way I did 11.4 miles and the knees held up just fine","Pass Mountain Hut

After breakfast and checking out of the hotel Susan and I drove to the ATC headquarters to get my picture taken for the ATC 2019 photo book.  We then went to the Point on High Street to drop me off to begin my third attempt this year to hike the trail.  
Weather was sunny and high 40’s and warmed up nicely through the day.  I saw lots of turtles in the C&O Canal and many song birds.  I climbed South Mountain and took some time to eat lunch at Weverton Cliffs (see pictures on blog) which had a wonderful view of the Potomac River.  I hiked the remaining 6.3 miles to Crampton Gap and have had a good dinner, stretched the legs and knees, called home, and will be ready for a great night sleep.  This is much more of the AT experience that I know and love.","Harpers Ferry

I woke to the sound of turkeys and woodpeckers. Met DB last night at camp who is doing a 10 day hike to complete an AT section and then visit some relatives in PA. He is a retired computer engineer.   We covered big miles today in order to get to Annapolis Rocks for a great sunset.  We passed Washington’s Monument which is the first monument dedicated in the US.
I was able to realize a long time dream today.  On I-70 there is a bridge over the road that has the sign that says “Appalachian Trail”.  I always thought it would be great to walk over the bridge and today I got my chance.
I got to use my tent for the first time and I really enjoyed it.

I got up at 6:10 and was on the trail by 7:05.  Plan was to get off trail before rain and thunderstorms hit around 1:00.  The trail was full of difficult rock scrambles, steep downhills, and one big uphill.  We covered the 7.2 miles in 3 hours and 45 min.  We finished hiking MD today when we crossed the Mason Dixon Line (took 4 days, one state down with 13 to go).  I am traveling with Dana, Flat Line, and Slow Goin.  When we finished the hike, Slow Goin decided to stay on trail but the three of us caught an Uber lift to the hotel.  We checked in at 1130 and our room was ready. After a hot shower we went to lunch at Applebee’s then did a resupply at Walmart.  We were able to do laundry and organize for the next few days of hiking.  Rain and storms moved in around 2:00 and had a tornado warning at 8:20.  Getting off trail has been a great decision with many positive results.  The town of Rouzerville has been very hiker friendly.  We start tomorrow with a hot breakfast and a shuttle back to the trail by 9:30.


DS: the past 24 hours had two very nice events.  At the shelter last night, Flat Line shared 2 small bottles of apple liquor infused with whiskey as our shelter crew sat around the campfire and shared stories.  A really nice social gathering on a cool evening.  This morning when we hit our first road crossing (mile 4.5) I was out of water with no spring until our final end point. I noticed a house about 100’ away with a hose in the yard.  I went to the house to ask for permission to fill my water bottle and the woman that answered asked me to wait a minute and left to get something.  When she returned she had 2 water bottles (one sparkling water and the other plain). I told her that was not necessary but she insisted I take both.  I thanked her and went my way.  There are many kind people out here and makes me thankful that I get the chance to meet them.","Raven Rock Shelter

Had a great night sleep and good breakfast at the hotel.  Shuttle picked us up and we were on the trail by 9:45.  Dana, Flat Line, and I hiked the first 5 miles then Flat Line stopped at Tumbling Rock Shelter and DB and I continued to Rocky Mountain Shelter.  Stopped at a nice picnic area/park and had lunch.  Lots of nice overlooks throughout the day.  I almost stepped on my first snake laying in the trail (18” garter snake).  He moved out of my way and it was his motion that allowed me to step around him.  At camp we met Mike from Boston who had driven to Harpers Ferry and then shuttled to our shelter so he could hike back to his car.  3 others in camp but tenting further down the mountain. 


DS:  I passed a father and his young    daughter (5-6) on the trail.  Dad had his daughter looking at a cut tree and teaching her about tree rings and the age of a tree.  It reminded me of times with my children learning new information.  Precious moments.","Old PA 16

Happy Easter!!!

PA does a great job with their shelters. Our shelter tonight has wooden bunk beds (better than on the floor) a nice covered porch, stream about 40’ away, multiple bear poles, and plenty of tenting space. We also walked through Quarry Springs Shelter and were amazed.  2 shelters connected by a single covered porch with picnic tables. The porch had a wind and rain screen and the spring was only 25’ from porch.  The shelter had a caretaker who has provided games, thermometer, dream catcher, wall art, swings, and best of all flower pots and bulbs from the local nursery.  A truly spectacular shelter.","Rocky Mountain Shelter

Started today with cool temperatures (low 50’s) and a slight breeze. After 2 miles in the mountains the next few miles were through fields and rolling hills which made for a pleasant hiking experience. The next 8 miles were up a big climb and miles of rock scrambles.  The final climb down the mountain was extremely difficult. I walked into town having hoped the local churches might have some room for hikers but nothing was available. I decided to go to the local hostel (Hotel Doyle) for hikers and got a room.  The room and facilities are meager but it is a place to stay and part of the AT tradition. The local grocery store sent a shuttle to pick up hikers for a resupply run which was really nice.  The laundry is several blocks away and laundry is complete. I ordered food in an Italian pizza shop.  Rain is forecast for tomorrow so I plan to stay and rest.  I have left a message at another local church to see if the have room for hikers.  


DS:  I noticed the “Prayer of Jabez “ prominently displayed in the Italian Restaurant.   It was good to see faith being shared at a public spot.","Darlington Shelter

Awoke after a restless sleep and went to breakfast at Goodies across the street from my “hostel”.  I had a great breakfast and good conversation with Sparkey behind the counter.  The patrons in the restaurant were definitely Trump supporters.  This part of PA seems very conservative and religious and not supportive of the new progressive politics.  After breakfast I decided I didn’t want to do my zero day at the hostel so I packed up and hiked to the AT trailhead and then got a Lyft to Harrisburg, PA to a hotel for the night.  Most of the day will be rest for the feet and lots of stretches to loosen the sore muscles.  Trail legs are developing but I still need lots of work.  Knees are fine so far but the down day is necessary after the last week.  Had a great dinner and watched Game of Thrones then went to bed.","Duncannon

Uber ride to trail was interesting because driver had little English skills.  I started hiking with temperatures in low 50’s with winds steady at 30 mph and gusts up to 50 mph.  Had to worry about being blown off the trail or limbs falling on me.  Got to see my first deer on the trail. Got to shelter which was occupied by 4 hamm radio operators.  The were very friendly and eager to share the shelter. While eating dinner, 2 trail angels brought cokes, Gatorade, and chips for the shelter. The also packed out our trash for us. Glad I stopped here today. 
DS:  one of the hamm operators offered to get my water at the spring 300 steps down the hill and 300 steps back ups.  This was a wonderful gesture offered to a tired hiker.  Another operator gave me a large candy bar and another gave me some Jamison for my coffee and a phone recharge from his battery.  Really great guys all of them were.","AT trailhead

Got an Uber to the trail and started a long and difficult climb.  Within a few hundred feet up I was unable to find a way over the rocks while carrying my pack.  I took off my pack to look for ways up the rocks when suddenly a hiker appeared about 20’ above me asking if I needed help.  I told him my problem and he graciously offered to help me.  He climbed down to me, took off his pack and the put my pack on and helped me up 2 steep inclines until I was able to carry my pack again.  His trail name was Meanderthal and he was section hiker hiking southbound.  His help was invaluable and God certainty provided for me (more on Meanderthal below).  Rest of the trail was uneventful until 2 miles from the shelter.  I was walking and suddenly heard the unmistakable sound of a rattlesnake rattle.  It took me a moment to process the sound and I instinctively jumped away from the sound (I hoped).  When I landed the sound stopped so I looked for the snake and he was curled up close to a tree just 3-4 ft from the trail.  I must have gotten too close so he rattled just to warn me.  God again kept me safe today because I never saw the snake before he sounded.  Arrived at camp safely and happy to not have been bit.


DS:  Yesterday when I got up my plan was to try and hike to a B&B about 6 miles beyond the Lehigh River.  I called the B&B at 0730 but got no answer.  I tried again at 0800 and got the answering machine so I left a message trying to get a reservation.  About 1030 I made contact with the B&B and no rooms were left.  I was forced to change plans and get off the trail at Lehigh River.  During my discussions with Meanderthal after his help he told me that he got the last room at the B&B about 0745, shortly after I had tried to call.  So if I had gotten the room instead of Meanderthal then I would have been stuck on the mountain trying to get to the B&B and Meanderthal would not have shown to help me in the rain.  God has perfect timing and provision.","Lehigh River

Last big day of hiking in PA.  Came off trail at DWG and checked in at the Church of the Mountain Hostel which is run by the local Presbyterian church.  The hostel has 8 bunks, a lounge area, shower, and toilet.  Towels and soap provided.  All the comforts a hiker would need to be comfortable.  Cost is donation only.  There are 4 NOBO hikers (Cinnamon, Doc Awesome, Doormat, and Snow White (from Frankfurt Germany)).  Also Antone and Stefan who I have shared the last few shelters with.  We ate lunch at the local bakery which had great food.  I ran into Chuck and Ted who were stopping for food and them moving on.  I also met a retired physics professor from UVA who is logistically supporting his wife who is hiking the trail.  Took a Lyft to Walmart to resupply.  Did some laundry in a bucket for a few items and everything dried in the sun.  Will go to dinner soon then bed and back on the trail tomorrow. 


DS:  I talked with Dave the hostel manager and he gave me some history of the hostel.  Been in operation for 43 years and Dave has been the manager for 30 years.  In the beginning the church took in hikers to their homes but as church membership declined the church decided to convert their old Sunday School wing to the hostel as it is today.  Last year they helped over 1000 hikers.  This is a really great ministry and provides a valuable service to the AT community.","Kirkridge Shelter

Eating properly on the trail is important and I am trying to learn what foods work for me.  Although I hike all day I haven’t had the desire to eat a lot at the end of the day yet.  Food intake needs to be more than quantity but also quality and the kinds of food I can enjoy.  So far the following items keep showing up  in my trail food bag to eat: beef jerky, avocados, snickers, Fritos, peanut butter, dried dates, Knorr rice and pasta sides, tortillas, chicken packets,protein bars, cheddar cheese sticks, and bacon.  More on food as I experiment and eat.","Delaware Water Gap

Temps in upper 40’s but sunny and warming thru day.  Made good time to the NJ high point park.  Stopped at visitor center for water and lady behind the desk offered me a free soft drink and opportunity to dump my hiker trash.  Met several hikers going south.  One was a retired Navy Medical Service Corps officer.  It was good to talk to a Navy man for awhile.  I went to the NJ high point monument but the monument was closed for climbing.  Camp tonight is on private property made available by a former thru hiker who built this just for thru hikers.  Good well water and an enclosed shelter.  Farm owner has a donkey that freely roams the property looking for handouts.  Expecting several days of rain starting tonight.  Saw lots of squirrels, chipmunks, and a rabbit.","Gren Anderson Shelter

Rained most of the night and awoke to rain and 46 degrees.  Decided to hike to next shelter in rain to get some miles rather than take a zero day.  Stopped at Horler’s General Store to get breakfast, water, and food resupply.  Got a coffee, doughnut, and great ham egg cheese sandwich.  Staff was very friendly and helped with all my needs.  Got to the shelter by 11:00 and discovered the water source for camp was not turned on by the park service.  Nearest good source was 2 miles down the trail.  Being a good scout I decided to try collecting rainwater and now have 3 liters of drinkable water for myself and 2 shelter mates Stefan and AG. Trying to stay warm as we wait out the rain.  Good time to plan for next few days and call home for Mother’s Day.  Have a Happy Mother’s Day to all the moms out there.","Secret Shelter

Another rainy night and wet morning start.  Day started in a routine manner but became difficult as day progressed.  Multiple rock scrambles increased throughout the day.  Rocks were damp and extremely slippery.  Came across a bridge over a creek which had a plaque on it saying the bridge was an Eagle Scout project.  It was great to see a project on the trail.  Crossed out of NJ and into NY at the top of the mountain.  Near the state line I also passed the highest point of the AT in NY which also had an American Flag flying.  Shelter is crowded tonight due to the rain.  8 people in a  shelter for 6 but we try to take in everyone that wants a dry spot.  I keep meeting NOBO hikers that started in GA.  Tomorrow is a 10 mile day then off trail to dry out, get clean, and resupply.  Not sure if I will take 1 or 2 nights.","Wawayanda Shelter

Left camp at 0715 with sunny skies but cool temperatures in low 40’s.  Lots of water on the trail and in the streams.  First creek crossing I had to remove my boots and put on my camp shoes (I am using water shoes) to cross thru knee deep water).  Later in the day I had to cross an elevated creek over a makeshift bridge (see picture).  Each time I was careful to unbuckle my pack in case I fell in so I could get the pack off quickly.  NY has been very challenging with very tough climbs up rock walls.  When AG and I got to NY-17 we got a Lyft to our hotel in Harriman.  We did laundry, some shopping, and resupply and then had a great dinner at TGI Friday.  Trying to eat big meals in town I had an appetizer of onion rings, bacon cheddar burger with salad, 22 oz beer, and an ice cream sundae.  AG is going back on trail in the morning but I am going to take a zero day to rest and do some additional chores.","Wildcat Shelter

On the trail by 0700 and came into the Bear Mountain area.  This was a really nice park with a nice observation tower on the mountain.  On the trail to the tower there was this comfortable wooden bench with a beautiful view of the valley below.  At the bottom of the mountain was a great park with a lake, paddle boats, picnic areas and a small zoo.  The AT went through the zoo to get to the bridge that crossed the Hudson River.  After a major climb in the afternoon, I came to the Appalachian Market which was located where the trail crossed a major road.  I got a big turkey and bacon sandwich and a cold beer.  I got some resupply items and ice cream and then hiked the last mile to my destination camp.  The Franciscan monastery allows hikers to camp on the baseball field. There is water, a shower, power, and portable toilets.  A great setup and service to the hiking community.


DS:  for the past week I have been homesick and thinking about stopping the hike.  I have been praying about this and I decided to call home and talk about my concerns with my wife.  After I finished the call home I was sitting on the wooden bench (mentioned above) and this couple approached me and asked if I was hiking the AT.  I said yes and they were all excited to meet a “real” hiker.  They had lots of questions and were encouraging me for all I had done so far.  Later I got an email from Dana who I hiked with in MD and PA and he had words of encouragement to continue the great hike.  I think God was sending me encouragement to not quit.  I plan to hike to Memorial Day weekend when my wife comes up for a visit.  I will revisit the issue of going home at that point.","West Mountain Shelter

Big thunderstorms last night with lots of rain but stayed dry and warm in my tent.  Rain stopped around 0300 so everything got a chance to dry so the tent packed away with little water or dirt.  Got on the trail at 0720 and made good time throughout the day.  At the 10 mile point I went into town and got a 6 slice thin crust pizza with pepperoni and veggies and a cream soda to drink.  I ate the entire pizza and took the crust pieces to camp for a dinner snack.  I also went to a deli and got a fruit pie and an ice cream sandwich.  Fruit pie and coffee for dessert tonight.  Having the pizza gave me extra energy for the afternoon.  So far I am the only one in camp but perhaps some are delayed by the afternoon storms.  I will finish up NY by Wednesday evening then on to CT.


DS:  while doing my morning routine today there were several families of geese at the lake.  I watched one family with 6 chicks go down to the lake for a swim.  What I noticed was how the parents provided directions to the chicks through example.  The chicks were led to the water, one parent went in and then waited and kept the chicks nearby until all were together then they swam as a group.  When they returned the process was reversed with some added tasks to get stable footing and then shake the feathers to remove water.  Each chick had to comply before the family moved on.  It was interesting to see how organized the geese were and how they trained their family members.","Clarence Fahnestock State Park

Good day of hiking with sunny skies and cool temperatures.  Several moderate climbs throughout the day.  Got to camp by 2:30 and decided not to go further due to rain forecast.  As these 49 days have gone by, my body has changed in many ways to adapt.  I can climb most any hill graded up to 1000 ft/mile.  My knees are strong but still require active stretching to remain usable.  I still struggle with some dizziness but I started taking Pedialite and that is making a big difference.  I have lost at least 20 pounds since I started at Harpers Ferry and I am starting to eat like a race horse especially in town.  I am enjoying the experience of hiking more each day.  I am glad I decided not to quit.

Woke to a beautiful sunrise from the fire tower.  Started hiking with the hope that most of our hike would be downhill and that the mud on the trail would be manageable.  The later didn’t occur.  The mud was terrible the entire day and slowed our progress significantly.  I had to give in again to walking through the mud because it was less tiring.  Had several stops that were pretty, especially Stratton Pond.  Ate a nice lunch at a rocky overlook of Manchester VT our destination for the evening.  Made hotel reservations from the overlook and then completed the hike in 2.5  hours.  We successfully hitched a ride into town and were dropped off at our hotel.  After cleaning up and laundry, AG and I had pizza and beer for dinner.  Afterward we sat on the patio area of the hotel next to the gas fire pit and the gas heaters.  We ate a pint of ice cream and had a few glasses of wine and talked for several hours with other hikers at the hotel.  Great way to end a hard day of hiking.","Stratton Mountain

Had a good breakfast at the hotel and our Uber driver arrived promptly at 0830 and we were back on the trail by 0900.  Some good climbs today and on the first climb up Bromley Mountain, I was on a ski slope and I had my first sighting of a black bear this hike.  A big bear came over a rise in the slope and walked down the slope about 20 yards and then re-entered the woods.  He was not bothered by our presence and just kept walking.   It was thrilling to see such a big bear in the wild.  Weather today was sunny and warm.  Tomorrow promises the same but Tuesday calls for rain all day.


DS:  today while on Bromley Mountain, 2 day hikers came up to AG and I and asked if we were doing the AT or the Long Trail.  We chatted for a while and one of the ladies asked if we would like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  We thanked them but declined but the offer was greatly appreciated.  The kindness and generosity of most of the hiking community has been great to experience.  It gives me some hope that our society is still ok at the core.","Manchester, VT

Today I enjoyed a no hiking day.  I got up with the hikers leaving today and then started my planning for the Whites.  The White Mountains have several different options for camping.  The first option is a mix of shelters and tent sites that are first come first served.  These are either free or have a small fee to use.  Hikers provide their own food.  The second option is a series of huts that require a reservation to book and are fairly expensive.  The huts provide a generous dinner and breakfast in addition to a bunk and blankets.  Huts have potable water and a privy but no electricity or heat.  My fIrst plan looked good based on mileage and elevation change but when I checked availability of huts I had to make some adjustments.  Once I had hut availability correct I made reservations.  My final plan is:


6/22: Kinsman Notch to Eliza Brook Shelter 
6/23: Eliza Brook Shelter to Liberty Spring Tent Site
6/24: Liberty Spring to Garfield Ridge Shelter 
6/25: Garfield Ridge to Zealand Falls Hut
6/26: Zealand Falls to Ethan Pond Camp

6/28: Mizpah Spring to Lake of Clouds Hut
6/29: Lake of Clouds to Osgood Camp
6/30: Osgood to Carter Notch Hut
7/1: Carter Notch to either Imp camp or Rattle River Hostel

Had a good night sleep and a good breakfast and out on the trail by 0815.  First half mile was a gentle uphill grade.  The trail then went very steep for the next 2 miles.  For most of this part I put my hiking poles away and free handed the rocks in my path.  Near  the top of the first mountain, the gondola from Wildcat Ski Resort let riders off to look around, hike, or enjoy the view.  I met Teradactyl (AT 2016) and his wife handing out trail magic to hikers.  I took a cold Mountain Dew soda which tasted great!  After a few minutes of conversation I made my way up the trail.  The trail still went up and down for the next 3 miles but was never as steep as the beginning today.  Along the way I met a section hiker who had a small dog with an injured paw.  The hiker was resting the dog but had to carry the dog while hiking.  As they were packing up the hiker asked for some help lifting the dog and pack onto her back and strapping the pack around the dog so it wouldn’t fall out.  I helped as needed and got them on their way.  The last mile of the trail to the hut was a steep downhill climb but the trail was mostly steps making the trip easier.  I got to the hut by 2:30 and checked in and cleaned up.  I was rather concerned about this hike as my first day back but I made it safely.  I am glad I only went 6 miles today.  It will take a few days to get my stamina back and my trail legs also.  I have done my stretches and taken my ibuprofen.  BBQ chicken is on the menu tonight.  Tomorrow’s hike is only 7.8 miles.  Good to be back on the trail again.","Pinkham Notch

Good sleep at hostel and back on trail by 0730.  Paul the owner of the hostel was a great host.  Today was the first double digit mileage day and my performance was good. Stopped for lunch and was able to collect a few blueberries to snack on.  Blueberries were sweet and juicy.  Got to Gentian Pond by 1630 averaging about 1.2 miles per hour.  Clear water is becoming harder to find so my plans may change as conditions dictate.  Weather tomorrow should be good but Wednesday starts the threat of afternoon thunderstorms.  Ran into a group of Virginians on trail today and it turns out one is a US Congressman.  It is good to be able to talk about home a little.  I should sleep well tonight.","NH 2

Left Full Goose at 0615 with the plan to hike to Mahoosuc Notch, complete the Notch, and to hike the “Arm” before rain around 1500.  I got to Mahoosuc Notch and started hiking it at 0745.  I completed the Notch in 2 hours.  The Notch is a gap through the mountain that is about 30 yards wide.  The notch is then filled in with boulders.  Hikers have to hike over, under, and around the boulders.  This is purely a climbing activity with a pack.  I had to remove my pack around 6-10 times to get through narrow passageways.  During the winter the notch fills with snow and then melts every season.  The notch still had ice and snow at the lowest levels which caused a cooling effect in the notch by about 20-30 degrees.  After finishing the notch I had to climb the Arm which was a very long and difficult climb.  I got to Speck Pond Shelter at 1230 and checked the weather report from the site caretaker.  Storms were predicted to start around 1500.  Because of the difficulty of the Arm and Mahoosuc Notch I decided to stop here for the night.  After cleaning up and getting water I laid down for 10 min that turned into 2 hours.  I guess I was really tired.  I am writing this entry down by the pond and the clouds have settled in but no rain yet.  Occasionally the clouds clear and I can look across the pond.  The caretaker hasn’t seen any moose this year.  I hope to get some more rest and be ready again for tomorrow.  The trail has been tough but my legs seem to be keeping up.  More tomorrow.","Full Goose Shelter

Started hiking at 0715 with the chance of showers all day and an afternoon thunderstorm.  Moderate 1.4 mile climb to start the day followed by a moderate 3.5 mile downhill to Grafton Notch.  Arrived at the notch at 1115 and had a snack.  Started a difficult climb to the Baldpate Lean-to and then the East peak of Baldpate mountain.  I stopped at the lean-to for lunch and while eating a big thunderstorm came through.  It took about an hour to pass before I could hike again but at least I stayed dry for the initial storm.  When I arrived at the East peak the clouds began to thicken and a light rain started. I had to hike to the West peak and by the time I got half way to the summit the West peak was fogged in and dangerous to climb.  I got to the dangerous section and decided to wait to see if the rain and clouds would dissipate.  I waited about 40 minutes with no luck so I decided to try the climb in the hope the weather would improve.  I had to crawl up the first 3 ledges before I could get enough traction to stand and walk.  After 15 min of effort the clouds began to dissipate and the sun broke through.  I made it over the top and down the mountain to the lean-to at 1815.  I was fully supported by God’s grace and provision today.  Tomorrow is a short hike to a road and then into town for a Nero.","Speck Pond Shelter

Got on trail at 0825 to start the major climb up Old Blue mountain.  Forecast was to be partly sunny and temperatures in the high 60’s.  Unfortunately that was not the weather on Old Blue.  Temperatures were in the low 50’s under cloudy skies and gusty winds.  This lasted most of the day until 1430 when the sun finally came out.  Winds remained gusty however.  The weather impacted my normal hiking routine throughout the day so I struggled with keeping hydrated and fueled up properly.  I will have to work on not letting the weather bother me.  Once the sun came out I got some beautiful views of the lakes and mountains ahead.  Got to camp around 1700 and met 3 other hikers (Kiwi, Tangles, and Trash Panda). All 3 are Nobo’s from GA.  Tomorrow I plan to get to Rangeley, ME and check into a hostel.  


DS: some of the unsung heroes of the trail are the volunteer trail maintenance crews.  They come out to maintain shelters, privy’s, build stairs, remove trees, and clean out drainage area.  I have seen many crew members and try to thank each one for what they do.  Today was no different when I met Richard.  We exchanged the usual pleasantries and I continued on.  About a half mile further I stopped for lunch at an overlook that also had a nice bench to sit on.  After eating lunch I was packing up and Richard came up the trail.  He said the bench had moved again.  I asked where it belonged and he told me he had built the bench and brought it up here 7 years ago.  He showed me the various places the bench had been.  He also took time to point out where the AT would go to the mountains in the distance.  Richard was a perfect host and demonstrated his love for the trail.  Thanks for all the maintenance crews do!!!","South Arm Road

I got to ME-27 by 1130.  I waited about 25 minutes and a 2017 hiker came by and offered a ride to the hostel.  Check in was at 1300 so all hikers had to wait but were given the opportunity to purchase drinks and food and rest until rooms were ready.  The hostel is a former bed and breakfast ski inn (next to Sugarloaf Ski Resort) that now caters to skiers in the winter and hikers and summer enthusiasts.  Went to dinner at the local Italian restaurant .25 miles away.  Food was very good.  Plan for tomorrow is to take a zero day with rain in the forecast.  I will sleep well tonight.","Crocker Cirque

Once across I hiked into Caratunk to find a place to get some breakfast.  I got a ride up the road to the Northern Outdoors outfitters. They were open for breakfast and I got 2 eggs, toast, hash browns, and coffee.  I also got an ice cream sundae.   I got a ride back to the trail and completed the 6.2 miles to the shelter.  There was 1 space left with storms forecast all evening. I did go down to the pond and sat on the dock and cleaned up. I stayed about 15 minutes enjoying the sun then had to get to camp as rain was coming in.

DS: trail magic isn’t always food.  Today it came in the form of transportation.  Caratunk had no cell service but did have a sign that said courtesy phone at post office to get in contact with hiker services.  I was about to go to the phones and a car pulled up and dropped off a hiker.  It turned out that the car was  2 men who drive around helping hikers.  They were called AT Trail Magic the B Team.

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626095,"After completing my summit of Katahdin and returning home to Virginia, I continued to follow my good hiking buddy “AG” and his progress to finish his thru hike.  When he arrived in Virginia, we made contact and plans to meet and hike together again.  We finally met in Waynesboro at Stanimals hostel and I spent the night at the hostel so we could get an early start on the trail.  We  were shuttled to the trail and had a great day getting re-aquatinted and sharing stories.  At the end of the day we returned to Stanimals and then went out for dinner.  I had to return  home and AG completed his thru hike the next day at Big Meadows where he had started on April 1, 2019.  It was an honor and privilege to hike with AG!  I wish him and his family well.  We may meetup again when I start my hike in May 2020 to complete my hike.","Pinefield Gap
