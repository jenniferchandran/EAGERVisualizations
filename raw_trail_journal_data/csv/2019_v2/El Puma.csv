Yesterday, March 3, El Puma started the trail (sorry for the typo in my last entry). I would like to update you on his progress during his first and second day on the trail. 
1st Day- Sunday, March 3
- Hiked 3.8 miles, Up to Springer Mountain with family and to the first shelter to sleep
- Slept in his tent next to the shelter
- During the night the temperature was in the high 20s (which as you know is cold enough to freeze). Since it had been raining all day and his shoes were wet El Puma decided to put his shoes outside of his tent. He also put the rest of his wet clothes outside. Since it was below freezing his wet clothing and shoes froze! 
2nd Day- Monday, March 4
- Hiked 5.8 miles
- Since his hiking boots were frozen El Puma made a smart decision and hiked 5.8 miles in his Crocs (which he is carrying as camp shoes)! Luckily no blisters have been formed so far. 
- He is sleeping in his tent next to the shelter
-  The low temperature is 15 degrees! Stay warm El Puma!
I will publish more updates in the next couple days.","

 El Puma as of today (3/5/19) has a total of 15.7 trail miles. Today he hiked approximately 7.5 miles and had some adventures along the way. At one point he was crossing a stream and fell in! Luckily nothing past his knees got wet. He just had some cold feet for the rest of the day. Also, at point he ran out of water and was getting dehydrated. At the point where the affects of his dehydration were starting to kick in he got to a nearby road where there was a water stand set up by the Army. This water station was specifically for hikers. He has now settled down for the night in his tent at the Gooch Mountain Shelter. He will make it to Suches by tomorrow and hopefully Neels Gap by Friday. 
Stay strong El Puma!","

Today (3/6/19) El Puma hiked 4.8 miles. He has a total of 20.5 trail miles. Tonight he is sleeping in a hostel in Suches. El Puma started out late this morning because of his frozen clothes! He had to let them thaw so he had something to wear! Also, at the end of todays hike kind strangers were offering him free soup, water, and a ride to the hostel. He took these things very graciously of course! His goal is to make it to Neels Gap by Friday.

He has taken Advil for them but they are still hurting. He thinks it will just be better to rest. El Puma believes that the next 18 miles are the hardest that there are in Georgia. El Puma will be sure to get back on the trail as soon as possible and get to North Carolina! This is not the last of El Puma! He will be back!","

Today El Puma hit the trail once again after his 2 day break. While on his break, El Puma did some shopping. He got more fuel for his portable gas stove and gel inserts to keep his feet as comfy as possible. Now back on the trail, he did a total of 5.7 miles today up two huge climbs. He then found a shelter to spend the night in at 3900 feet. It is supposed to be a bit chilly tonight because he is so high up.         Love you El Puma!!","

El Puma,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608285,"La Pumita here, 
Today El Puma did a whopping 11 miles! He had some crazy adventures tonight trying to find some place to sleep. He was ready to settle in for the night at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee GA but that did not happen. Since all the rooms in that hotel were booked El Puma found a lone Uber driver in the town and hitched a ride 15 miles back Blairsville. There he finally found a hotel. He was very frustrated about how he had to back track. El Puma also helped other people on the trail today. One hiker was doing an overnight with his grandkids and asked El Puma to lock his car for him. The hiker gave El Puma the keys to his car and said ""Help your self to the cooler in the back"". El Puma helped a guy out and got an ice cold lemonade.

He did 3.7 trail miles today. He most likely did miles off the trail also while helping hikers. He'd love to find a way to make a living helping hikers when he's down to the last few of his nine cat lives. With a focus on the older crowd who need some extra motivation. He is camping alone tonight in a nice cozy spot right off the trail. Watch out for bears El Puma! You've got this!","

El Puma,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609106,"El Puma himself posting for the first time:I want to thank my girls, Michelle, and Kyle for helping me fulfill a long held dream.  And I want to let you know that El Puma will be back on the trail.  Soon and as often as possible.  But the extended hike has come to a close.No tears for El Puma.  I have had (and will continue to have) an amazing time ""walking"" in the woods.  What an experience!  I learned so much about camping and multi-day hikes over the last few weeks.  The adventure was what I expected in many ways and much more in others.  The weather was miserable at times.  The hiking was rarely easy.  The people were great.  The trail culture is something everyone should experience.  Hiking or volunteering.  The AT is a national treasure.But an amazing career opportunity and personal obligations are keeping El Puma less than 100 percent committed to a thru-hike.  And anything less than 100 percent is not enough.  I applaud the many people out there getting up each and every morning with nothing but Katahdin on their minds.So I will be back in Charlotte today after 110 or so trail miles.  I didn't have a goal in mind when I started.  But I did check a lot off the midlife crisis bucket list despite hiking only 5 percent of the way:  back to a reasonable level of fitness, time to think about what is truly important in life, and a renewed appreciation of the goodness of random strangers.Wish me luck on the trail of life as I commit 100 percent to my family and the next chapter of my journey.  And simply to live a happier life as a kind person.Last, thank you girls for your encouragement and the phone calls during my trip.  So proud of who you are and where you are going!Fist bump!","Franklin, NC

El Puma,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611799,"La Pumita here,El Puma is back baby! He decided to go back with his girls so they could experience the AT too. He had some trouble getting through even a short day of 3.7 miles. While carrying his pack filled with 3 people's gear he regretted spending a few weeks sitting around and watching soccer. In the end he made it with help from La Pumita (me!) and Blaze (my annoyingly fast little sister) and some kind strangers. Before we arrived at camp we found some rare personalized trail magic from Second Chance. Nothing like a double stuffed Oreo on a nice day hiking! Our campsite was wonderful even though it had a pretty rough looking shelter. There was a giant area of grass that probably could have fit 20 tents! Me and Blaze had a fun time camping in the middle of the woods. Filtering and boiling water, cooking dehydrated Pad Thai in a bag, and meeting some nice hikers. We ended up taking their trash because they were thru hiking and we were just little ol' day hikers. Thanks El Puma for taking me and Blaze on this adventure!","

El Puma,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611803,"La Pumita here, Today El Puma, La Pumita, and Blaze did more miles than planned. Real miles are sadly not trail miles. To get back to the AT from our shelter we had to take a detour to the top of Siler Bald. It was worth it though. It is so beautiful up there at 5216 feet. After that it was pretty easy going. Downhill the rest of the way to the road. At the road we got a shuttle to our car. Once back at our car we got to give back to the AT. We did trail magic and helped some tired and hungry hikers out. Chips, Mountain Dew, and Moon Pies got the hikers VERY excited. I hope I will have another chance on the AT along with El Puma and Blaze. El Puma will most likely struggle but he always makes it.","

Blaze took care of a sweaty Puma but we were a little pressed for time to make camp.  Stayed at the designated camp site a little past the shelter.  No other hikers.  Very empty trail on a summer weekday.","Wayah Bald Tower
