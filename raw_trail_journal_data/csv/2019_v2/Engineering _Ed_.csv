"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608967,"I've registered my hike today, starting in Harper's Ferry, WV in mid-May. I'm going to try to get some of the southern sections done before then, since my timeline for starting my job in October only gives me 4 months and 18 days. I'll be moving slowly to avoid injury, and with the average time to complete the trail being 5-7 months, I want to plan on having to do sections before and after my goal timeline.",,Still at Home,"Mar 27, Wed",0
"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613381,"I’ve gotten rained on for the first couple of days. (But my
gear is working as it should be, except for my 15 degree bag, which doesn’t
seem to keep me comfortable in 45 degree weather. I think soon though it will
get very warm.)
I’ve managed to stay dry (although very muddy). I cut
my hand badly, but I should be fine. My first aid kit worked as it should. I’ve
used pretty much everything that I’ve brought with me—I don’t think I over
packed. 
I’ve met some wonderful people, including two thru-hikers:
Turbo and Captain, and two other flip-floppers who started on the same day as
me. I’m surprised I’ve kept pace with them. 
I’m grateful to be out here. The muddy uphills are whipping
me physically. I’m happy to take it slow and enjoy the view while I get my trail
legs.

not a creek. See the white blaze?)","

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613651,"It looks like I’ve made it through the worst of the weather. Several NOBO thru-hikers have said that my first two days were the worst weather/trail-conditions they’ve seen (and the started in Georgia in February!). So I feel pretty good having made it through that. My body is battered though. My everything is sore, my feet are covered in blisters, I have random sharp pains in my shoulders, back, knees, ankles, and feet. My ankles especially have been taking a beating on the Rocky and muddy terrain. So I’ve decided to take a zero-day, or a recovery day in town to tend to my wounds. I’ve also had a hard time eating and sleeping, which a rest will help with. 

Around 3pm every day, after walking for 6-7 hours, I get pretty mentally worn down. I’m only doing a mile every 40 to 60 minutes, and I get stressed in the late afternoon about being able to make it to a shelter before dark (or at all!). It’s been brutal, but I’m keeping up with the people who started with me—slow but steady. 
My favorite part so far is never know what the next turn will bring; there have been so many different terrains. One day I hit overlooks and muddy trails, followed by boulder fields, sweeping farmlands, swamps, overflowing river crossings, sheer cliffs, and a field of ferns.","

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614158,"Some sage advice from a fellow hiker. I was chatting to a couple of hikers coming down the trail, as I was hiking up the steep slope. We exchanged how-are-ya’s and I commented on how I was going slowly up this steep hill, to which they responded “don’t worry. it gets better at the top” 


My rest day paid off. The cut on my hand and my blisters are healed. I did a day hike with Justine and Kenny. It was really nice! They let me stay the night with them and drove me too and from the trail. I’m feeling very spoiled and very loved. 


I’m at the point where I’m definitely noticing the difference a good nights sleep and a hardy meal makes. A turkey sandwich I had at lunch powered me through a 10 mile day in a thunderstorm. It was a wicked storm. It was almost comedic how heavy the rain was— it was like something out of the Truman Show. I have now hiked through a hail storm twice! I felt quite safe once I made it to the shelter. I’m tired, hungry, wet, and proud of my progress!


The first part of Pennsylvania has been filled with pines and mountain laurels. I got a picture when the rain subsided for a bit. It was such a relief to make it to the shelter (pictures) right before the heavens opened up again.","

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614722,"A hundred miles down 2,090 miles to go, but who’s counting. I had a great 15 mile slack-pack day with my Dad that put me over the 100 mile mark. We went through what is fondly referred to as the “Rock Maze” in central PA. There was a lot of scrambling over big boulders and looking around for the next trail blaze.  


I can feel that I’m getting stronger; my steps don’t feel so sluggish. My niece asked me how many miles I had left to get to Maine, but I really don’t keep those kinds of numbers in my head. I’m thinking more about how many miles are left in the day or even before lunch. I had a rest day that was still a 5 mile day and that feels awesome. 


I’ve been running into more thru-hikers. They say that they’d do 30 mile days of it weren’t for their feet. Their lungs and muscles have caught up to their long days, but the feet never get used to the constant pounding. It’s somehow comforting to know that that doesn’t get better. 


I’m in the middle of Rocks-ylvania. I’m still wearing my Tevas, so I can feel every bit of the rocks under my feet. The thick pair of Darn Tough socks actually help a lot. I also picked up a pair of poles, which one thru-hiker called a “game-changer.”","

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615099,"The longer I’m out here the more I think all thru-hikers
must be a little crazy. Leaving the comfort of home, easy access to food and
water, security of a locked door, to enter the wild with only what you can
carry on your back goes against every survival instinct. 

Every time I leave the trail and come back I get
nervous/scared because it goes against a survival instinct. When I am out here,
I’m less stressed about my responsibilities, but I feel a very fundamental
stress about where I will sleep that night, if I can physically make it to the
next shelter, or if I will have enough water that day. 
But when I went to go back on the trail this most recent
time I had a different type of negative gut feeling. I’m not sure exactly what
it was, but I knew I couldn’t get back on right here right now. So I took
another day in town and took the opportunity to go to the doctor. I just got a
call from the doctor that they caught something. I’ll follow up with my doctor
at home in a week, and I decided to start hiking in GA, while I am there. It’s
nothing urgent, but it has the potential to be, so I’m glad I caught it! Listen
to your gut. 
I’m making slow progress, but it is still forward progress.
I hiked down and back up half a mile and 300 stone steps to get to my water
today. And although it goes against all reason, I love the feeling of
accomplishment I have at the end of each day!","

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615423,"Again, one of my favorite parts of hiking all day every day on a new part of trail, is that you never know what you’re going to see around the next turn. After a big thunderstorm last night (I was in my tent and everything held up well. I stayed dry.), I had a couple of early surprise water crossings. At 8am I was had a choice. A sign said “Water Crossing Beaver Dam Ahead” and another sign pointing in a different direction: “Alternate Dry Route A.T. 1.6 miles.” I had never seen a beaver dam, and how bad could it be? So I made the early morning adventurous decision to cross the beaver dam.


Turns out that beaver dams are long, and cause a lot of damage even with only a small creek. There was a small bridge somewhere in the middle that showed where the trail had previously crossed a creek only a couple of feet wide. Beavers had then dammed up the creek a tenth of a mile in either direction, causing water on both sides to cover the forest floor. The dam ran parallel to the trail, with the trail going through the not-lake-side. The water was surprisingly deep on the trail side though. Typically when you cross a creek or a river there are rocks, but the ground was still covered in dirt and undergrowth, which made it really difficult to walk through. It was pretty tough to get across that long section of trail through knee-high stagnant muddy water filled with limbs and roots. It was tiring but an adventure!


Also before noon, I hit two other precarious water crossings with fallen trees as bridges. 


I’ve been having some serious problems eating. I haven’t been eating enough to sustain all of the hiking, so although I feel stronger and lighter, I feel worn down and just tired. I’m stopping for a resupply of food, and I’m stocking up on the foods I’ve been able to eat.","

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617630,"Every hiker I meet in the shelters seem to have a Pennsylvania rattlesnake story, and now I have one of my own. Another flip-flop thru hiker was walking just ahead of me when she called back to warn me she’d been rattled at. When she described it as being black, I thought it was probably a rat snake, faking a rattle. But when I walked up, it was indeed a large, black rattle snake with gold markings that were hard to see. I didn’t know rattlesnakes got that dark. It was in the process of eating a rat and gave us no issues other than a warning rattle as we walked a wide arc around it. Generally, the snakes in the north seem less aggressive than the ones I’ve encountered in the south. I imagine it has a lot to do with the temperature. 
I’m still going slow. My feet hurt after a rocky 10-mile day. I wish I had a photo of the rocks I’m walking through. They are medium (football sized), loose and with sharp edges. I’m seeing more of what they describe as axe-head rocks—rocks that angle up to a long skinny edge.","

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617639,"I left the trail to go to doctors appointments at home in SC. I’m glad to get off the trail for a bit, mostly because I haven’t been feeling well, and I’m hoping it’s a quick fix. Unfortunately it has been a bigger issue than I thought with two appointments and two procedures. I’ve been cleared to hike!
Between doctors appointments I’ve been hiking the Georgia section. It’s been a pleasure—very green and overgrown this time of year. I feel very low motivation. There are so few people on this section of the trail at this time of the year. I’ve met a couple of long section hikers, some (youth?) groups, and a lot of day hikers. 
I had heard Springer Mountain was a meadow, but it was a beautiful view from a mountain top. I was pleasantly surprised.","Springer Mountain

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617984,"It feels weird to be back on the trail full time. It’s taken me about three days to get back in my groove. I’m really loving the terrain as I leave PA and enter NJ. It’s a little too hot though. I’m getting a lot of sun, and it seems to be a dry area with not so much rain or cool delicious springs. 


I still feel sluggish and tired. I’m picking up the mileage though. I had a pretty good 13 mile day over descent terrain. There have been a lot of balds and summits with very little tree coverage, which makes the sun and heat brutal. Antd despite names like rattlesnake mountain, rattlesnake springs, and rattlesnake swamp trail, I’m seeing way fewer snakes than in PA. No rattlesnakes so far *knock on wood*.
oh, and one gear change update  I got Guthook’s app for this section of the trail, and I really like it. It is an app that uses your gps and trail maps to show your location on the trail and info like closest water source or shelter. I was feeling stressed about not having enough information, especially for water in this dry area. Guthooks helps a lot; people can add comments, so you can figure out if a water source is flowing well that day or decide between two options based on which one is better quality, etc.

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618278,"I had read that NJ has the highest population of bears per square mile than any other section of the AT, and anecdotally that seems to be true. Daniel, who has started hiking with me, saw a bear and two cubs on his first day on the trail!


I’ve gotten pretty good at being able to tell what kind of animal is in the woods based on the sounds it makes walking through the leaves (squirrels make way more noise than you think they should). I was almost to a shelter when I heard what I thought sounded like a clumsy human, and I look up to see two medium sized black bears running through the woods. My first bear encounter. It really wasn’t a problem; they didn’t want anything to do with me. 


Don’t quote me on this, but I could really use some higher elevations and/or some rain. The hot stagnant air has been tough, and the water sources are pretty stagnant as well. The views are awesome though. 


There have also been a lot of swamps and bogs through NJ, that the trail volunteers have built boardwalks over (pictured). It’s a fun change of pace.","
",New Jersey,"Jul 01, Mon",0
"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618279,"I crossed into New York! So long boardwalks and bears! Immediately after crossing into NY, it was a long day of “rocky outcroppings.” There were long 5 mile sections of walking across rocks with not tree coverage during the hottest part of the day. 


I got very quickly dehydrated. I was hot, tired, shaky, dizzy, and balancing/hopping/climbing over rocks. I’m grateful for the little rock climbing experience I have; it definitely makes me a stronger hiker. After hours of this type of strenuous and exposed hiking, I took a hard fall and rolled my ankle /tweaked my left leg. After that I started actually sitting down on the rocks and scooting across or down any section requiring stability. It was tough, but beautiful views. 


I was avoiding giving exact locations and dates, but I wanted to share this bc it was so cool! I was at the highest point in NY on the AT for the Fourth of July, where they have a big American flag (pictured). There was lots of trail magic, in the form of coolers of drinks at road crossings. I couldn’t see any fireworks, but I could hear them. I slept solid through the night anyway after that long day of rocky outcroppings. It was only about 13 miles, but it was the hardest day yet.","

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618473,"After that hard day and fall, I took a couple of short 5 mile days. It was really pleasant to slow down. There are many blueberries and some raspberries along the trail on this section, so I’ve been picking a lot of them. I’ve jokingly been saying I’m picking all the berries along the trail so that bears won’t come looking for berries along the trail. But really I just enjoy them. It’s tricky stooping to pick berries with a heavy pack throwing your balance, but 100% worth it. 


I’ve taken some time to reflect on my original goals with coming out on this hike. Mainly I wanted a big dose of perspective of what it means to carry everything you need to spend months outside, to walk thousands of miles. A surprising perspective change is my perspective towards food. I’m worried I’m going to have bad food habits after spending so much time making food choices based on what has the most calories and looking for carbs. Gas stations are now good food options. I almost cried walking in to a QT because I was so overwhelmed by the amount of food and food options. On the trail, often you resupply your food from vending machines, convenience stores, dollar stores (if your lucky). Grocery stores or fresh produce is pretty rare. I’m hoping that I’ll be more appreciative of settling in one place and having the opportunity to grow my own food. 


I kind of imagined that short distances would seem like nothing— “6 miles, oh that’s nothing!” One change in perspective I’m surprised by is how I think I understand now exactly how long 6 miles can be. I joke that walking is my least favorite part of the day, but I’m actually starting to hate walking a little. That perspective change worries me, so it’s been nice to slow down and stop to pick the berries.

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618931,"The trail goes pretty close to New York City. Shortly after my views of the city, I took a side trip into town. At a railroad crossing on the AT a train actually stops to pick up and drop off passengers on the trail. There’s no station or anything; there is barely a platform. We took the train to and from the trail. They have you go out the very back door, with a three foot drop down onto a small wooden deck, right on the trail.
New York City was not as overwhelming after being in the woods all day every day as I thought it would be. I think I am more stressed out in the woods than I realized. It was almost a relief to be around so many people. The biggest difference I noticed about NYC was the abundance of food and lack of access to bathrooms.

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620343,"I crossed into Connecticut, my first time in the state! I am loving CT. Thru hikers had gossiped about the smooth trails of Connecticut while hiking through Pennsylvania. I have not been disappointed. Although, there have been some tough climbs with some rocks and “rocky outcroppings,” generally it has been smooth, level, soft, dry dirt. Most of the rocks have been round river rocks.


In other states the trail blazed will send you over a pile of boulders, in a haphazard “the trail may be in this general direction” kind of way. In Connecticut the path cuts through walls of boulders on a smooth dirt path in a “oh, here, let me get that for you” kind of way. 
Also noteworthy: I have been seeing the word “hi” written out in twigs on the trail. When I first noticed one I just assumed someone had taken the time to spell it out. (It’s pretty common practice for hikers to leave messages in twigs or rocks like “1200 miles” or “shelter.”) But as I kept noticing the word, I realized it’s probably just coincidence. “Hi” is pretty easy to have happen naturally, and it may be something you just start to notice when looking at your feet all day!","

"Engineering ""Ed""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620345,"I love Connecticut! It’s not all smooth trails and river rocks as was rumored. There have been some difficult, rocky inclines, and stagnant unpleasant water sources, but it is still my favorite part of the hike. The people are kind, the towns are beautiful and have everything a hiker could need for resupply. I hope to visit Kent, CT again sometime. 


Despite my enjoyment of Connecticut, I’m abandoning the north for now. I will have an exciting piece of trail to look forward to returning to. I’m still struggling a bit physically and am just too slow of a hiker to make it to Katahdin before my late August deadline. I am excited to leave in CT, because I know I’ll be motivated to come back and conquer the green and white mountains in better health. I look forward to going back south and being close to family, support, (and in-network doctors). 


I feel badly for hopping around on the trail so much, but I truly am making it my own hike.","
