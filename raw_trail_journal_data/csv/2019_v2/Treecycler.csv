Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522230,"Well, the planning has begun for the sixth - and hopefully, final - phase of our Appalachian Trail hike. My father and I - ""Kikker"" and ""Treecycler"" - started at Springer Mountain in 2008, hiking for a month and ending at Hot Springs. Since then we've been hiking the A.T. on the ""installment plan,"" one month at a time. In 2010 we made it to Atkins, VA. In 2012 we ended our hike at the south end of Shenandoah National Park, and in 2013 we hiked to Duncannon, PA. Last year, we finished our month on the trail in Stormville, NY. And this year, our goal is to make it all the way to Katahdin. More to come as the planning really gets underway...","

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522941,"Living in the Midwest, I don't have any mountains to climb in preparation for our A.T. hike. So my weekly training consists of a combination of the following:  1) One or two four- to six-mile runs on the gravel roads around our house, using the trekking poles and trail running shoes;2) A four or five mile hike along the river bluffs half an hour away (with 20 to 25-lb pack);3) Hour and a half gym workout (running, weight machines and stair climber)4) Walking the back stairs at work (about 525 steps); 5) Ten-mile bike ride.Which ones I choose depend on the weather and my other obligations. But as my father and I have often said to each other, the only real training that gets you in shape for the Appalachian Trail is hiking the Appalachian Trail. You can't replicate hiking all day, every day, over mountains, carrying thirty or forty pounds of gear, in any other way except by just doing it. Ever since we started hiking the trail a month at a time, the pattern has been: spend the first two weeks on the trail getting up to speed. By the midpoint of the third week, we're up to 14 to 15 miles per day, which is a good speed for us. And seven or ten days later, we have to stop and head home again. This time, with a three-month trip planned, we're looking forward to getting our Trail Legs and keeping them.","

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527340,"With less than a month to go until we hit the trail, I have ramped up my training:
Sunday: 4-mile run and strenuous yard work
Monday: weightlifting and 30 minutes on the stair climber with a 25-lb pack
Tues/Weds: 2 mile walk only (rest/recovery)
Thursday: 40 minutes bicycling over hills
Friday: 5 sets of stairs (530 steps) with 25-lb pack
Saturday: 8.2 miles of hiking up and down river bluffs with 35-lb pack.
Today's hike felt surprisingly good, and I'll follow that with another 4-mile run tomorrow. At this point, a couple of workouts per week isn't enough. My goal is to get the body used to working hard every day. It can be difficult to pull that off with a full-time work schedule. But sometimes, as with stair climbing, a short workout can pack a real punch.","

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527344,"I've picked up a hobby that keeps me motivated to hike in new and different places - my Hiker Jacket. I figured out recently that all the cool people wear things with patches on them: bikers - veterans - Girl Scouts. I think the evidence is pretty clear. So last year when I was recovering from knee surgery, I started sewing all the patches I've collected from trips over the years on to the back of an old denim jacket. 
The patches are from state parks, trail systems, national monuments, fossil dig sites, and more. Now that it's nearly full, I'm finding I really enjoy the ""patchwork quilt"" look. I'm seeking out patches of certain colors to balance what's already there, and saving a few spots for ones I know I'll acquire sometime down the road. It's a great way of remembering some of my favorite adventures at a glance, and it keeps me looking forward to the next hike - and the next patch!","

We started driving just before 4 pm on Friday from Minnesota, and drove through the night to get to ME by Sunday. Three-hour shifts during the day, two hours at night, and one person drives while the other sleeps. All meals were eaten in the car. We have to move fast in order to catch our shuttle ride down to NY Sunday morning. We had the usual troubles with road construction and navigating around I-80 in Indiana, but we didn't plan for Moose Delays. I saw more moose in VT, NH and especially ME yesterday than I have seen in my life. Twelve in all! Crossing roads, munching vegetation in the swamp, staring at us quietly from the side of the road. Twice we had to stop to let them cross the road in front of us. Then we made it to our hostel and got set up in the last nice bed we will see for some time. Tore the packs apart and repacked all the gear. And this morning we hopped in the shuttle right on time! Later today we'll be back on the trail.","

We hiked a comfortable 3.9 miles to Morgan Stewart shelter in sunny, cool weather. Learned that we have just missed a solid week of rain.

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533165,"We had good terrain to start out on our first full day. Nice and easy and no major climbs. That's probably why we were able to do more than 12 miles. Met our first southbound (SOBO) section hiker, Chance, after a snack stop at Nuclear Lake. We wish him well and hope to see him down the trail. The views from the ridge tops are lovely, with all of the trees decked out in their first spring greens. Spring flowers so far include Vasey's trillium and jack in the pulpit. We had a welcome afternoon break at Native Landscapes - very hiker friendly place! Great to relax on the porch with a cold drink. The head nets came out once we camped. Gnats are plentiful.","Morgan Stewart shelter

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533170,"We finished New York today! 9 states down, 5 to go! Another good day in terms of terrain and weather. 70 degrees with some clouds. Today we met Grasshopper, section hiking in preparation for the Long Trail, and enjoyed our lunchtime chat with him. (Who knows, maybe we will see you in VT.). Hiked along the Housatonic River and also saw one of our favorite flowers from down South, gaywings. The end of day climb to the campsite was tough for tired legs. A little while before arriving I spotted a rattlesnake 8 feet off trail, curled up in the leaves. It didn't have any interest in us. Cold night again but at least it's always warmer in the tent than in a shelter.","Woods campsite

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533171,"The first three days are catching up with us. Muscles are tight and tired. It was hotter today and the hiking was harder - many ups and downs. The flip side of hiking this early in the year is that there is very little shade in the woods - the trees just aren't leafed out yet. So a hot day can feel that much hotter. We came down the St. John's Ledges in the afternoon when we were already tired (Grasshopper told us about these...) Very steep descent over and around large rocks and boulders. Thankfully, the last several miles were flat ground along the Housatonic. Not a bad day, just challenging.","Schaghticoke Campground

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533196,"Today started out with a wonderful 3 mile hike along the river. Second breakfast was at Silver Hill Campsite and I am sorry we weren't able to stay here. It has a kitchen pavilion and a two-person swing. From there, the trail got hotter (temps up to 80) and bumpier, with more of the ""PUDs""(Pointless Ups and Downs) we have come to expect. Stopping for breaks at streams, rather than overlooks, is our new favorite activity - bare feet in a cold stream cools you down fast. We are still working on getting our Trail Legs (toughening up the feet and muscles so we can go further and faster), which will probably take a good two weeks. So far, we have averaged a snake sighting per day, which is always a treat. Mostly garter snakes, a rat snake and that rattler. There are chipmunks all over in the forest, which may explain the healthy snake population. 
There's barely a soul on the trail during the week. We meet about four other hikers a day, most of them local. We were the only ones at the shelter again tonight.","Stewart Hollow Brook shelter

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533203,"As we hike, we are encountering many of the same plants and animals that brightened our southern AT section hikes in the springs of 2008, 2010 and 2012. I have learned a lot of bird calls and can now hike along with a fair idea of what species are in the trees around us. Here are the ""Top 15"" AT birds in Connecticut this spring:OvenbirdWood thrushScarlet tanagerRose-breasted grosbeak Baltimore orioleCatbirdVeeryAmerican redstartBlack- throated green warblersBlack and white warblerTufted titmouseYellow-bellied sapsuckerRufous-sided towheeBlack-capped chickadeeTurkey vulture
Today we hiked a comfortable 11.4 miles and took a side trip to dine at Toymakers Cafe in Falls Village. The food was excellent, and we had the good fortune to run into section hikers Skip and Susan, whom we had seen twice before. We had such fun talking with them that it was hard to leave. A drizzle set in toward the end of the day and quickly progressed to rain as we fought our way down the extremely steep, and now slippery, side trail to the shelter. Wet but not soaked, we were grateful to be under a roof as the pace of rain increased. The sound of raindrops on the metal roof was positively musical, reminiscent of an mbira (African thumb piano), at least in my mind. Here we also saw our first bear box of the section hike. An entry from the day before said a bear was sighted at the shelter just yesterday but we had no trouble during the night.","Pine Swamp Brook shelter

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534300,"Today we hiked into Salisbury, CT - a short day, but it's time to resupply. We are staying with Maria McCabe, 87 yrs young, who's been hosting hikers in her home since 1999. Maria knows what hikers love! Fresh fruit and juice on arrival, a shower, and a ride to the laundromat (which is next to an Italian restaurant)! Perhaps best of all, she has a supply of ""loaner"" clothes from thrift stores so that when we go to do laundry, we can wash ALL of our outfits. Very thoughtful. A thunderstorm rolled in as we were falling asleep, glad to be under a roof and in a comfortable bed.","Limestone Spring shelter
","Salisbury, CT","May 14, Sat",4.10
Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534304,"An interesting day. We left Maria's place early, and noted at the trailhead that the parking lot was full of cars. Thereafter, we saw all kinds of people, whereas up until now, we have only seen a handful each day. Families, couples, dog walkers, trail runners, section hikers; there were also 4 or 5 student groups from Yale. Dad and I got separated early on when he accidentally took a side trail below Lion's Head. When I reached the view and he wasn't there, I figured something had happened. Luckily, a family group was able to tell me he hadn't come through. I saw him on the trail below me within minutes. Temps have dropped and it was cold, windy walking on Bear Mtn and down the very steep descent into Sage's Ravine. Toward mid-afternoon, we decide we have enough energy to climb Mt. Everett before we camp, giving us a 13-plus mile day. It's a steep climb. Sometimes we have to use handholds. As we ascend, dad says ""is that what I think it is?"" The clouds are spitting snow down on us - hard, graupel- like balls. Sometimes it's hard to see each other. On top, the pine trees are so stunted we are taller than they are. A quick climb up to a blustery outcrop, and we see something entirely new: along the bottom edge of the low clouds, where snow is still falling, there's a ""snow bow"" - a fleeting bit of rainbow! Amazing. We drag ourselves into camp, set up the tent and huddle around a much-appreciated fire built by fellow hikers Frog Monkey and Husband. It's going to be a cold one tonight.","Salisbury, CT
",Glen Brook shelter,"May 15, Sun",13.40
Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534311,"As expected, we woke up freezing this morning. The tiny REI thermometer read 32 degrees. We wore all of our clothes to bed last night, plus our rain gear. The wind has been howling in the hemlock trees all night. The sun comes out, but it stays cold and the wind never really lets up. All day we're donning layers of clothes and then shedding them on the next uphill. There's another steep descent off Jug End and then about five miles of flats, so we try to go a bit further today. We discover our first Trail Magic (free snacks and drinks for hikers!) at a road crossing, courtesy of two fellow hikers. Figured we were too early for it - so this is a nice surprise.
Climbing over East Mountain to get to the next shelter, we ""hit the wall"" with about two miles to go. When we finally stumble into camp, where we are glad to see familiar faces from the night before, we're well beyond exhausted, physically and mentally. A shorter recovery day has got to be in the cards tomorrow. 
After dark, a porcupine comes out of the woods and gnaws on the side of the shelter for a while. (Apparently they do this for the salt left behind by people's bodies). Then it makes a curious whining yelping call, over and over. For half an hour. All over the shelter, folks dig out their earplugs and try to sleep...","Glen Brook shelter

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534337,"Today we reached 100 miles for this section hike. It feels great to be into the triple digits. About 650 miles to go. At our lunch stop I had beautiful views of Blackburnian and black-throated blue warblers. Most hikers laugh when they see we are carrying binoculars - that's a pound and a half of extra weight, you know. But it is completely worth it. We are also hitting the peak of the painted trillium bloom. 
We met Bones, our first thru-hiker. He left Springer Mtn., GA on Feb. 18. Moving very fast. I don't suppose we'll see him again, although we hope to. 
For the night, we camp at the site of a once-thriving Shaker village near Tyringham. All that remains here is a stone wall and a piece of wheeled machinery that has been half-consumed by a tree.   There's so much history here, buried just beneath the surface.","Tom Leonard shelter
",Shaker Campground,"May 17, Tue",11.20
Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534550,"No bears last night, although they have recently been seen in the area. The morning is cool and comfortable with more warblers moving through (incl. bay-breasted this time). Dad and I don't usually talk much as we hike - we're often several dozen yards apart as we hike. But today we do discuss my grandfather Heit, who ice skated the formidable two-day Elfstedentocht (Eleven Cities' Race) in Holland twice during the 1930s. It's pretty cool to see this ""genealogy"" of endurance trips shaping up on dad's side of the family - from that to dad's Birkebeiner ski races, his kayak trip down the Missouri River in 2005, and now our shared Appalachian Trail hike.
Although we could probably have hiked on for another few miles, the pull of Upper Goose Pond Cabin is just too great. It is a two-story cabin located in a beautiful undeveloped pond. It has a bunk room, covered cooking area, living room/ library, front porch and a dock where you can sit and relax while looking out over the pond. Usually, it is still closed right now, but we are in luck- the caretakers have opened it up early. And unbelievably, there will be blueberry pancakes for all in the morning, courtesy of Pete, the caretaker. How could we pass this up? So we spend a long afternoon chatting with other hikers and taking it easy after a couple of long days. I also find a book for the road - a Travis McGee mystery novel. A good day!","Shaker Campground

Dad took four extras along for lunch (they're good with peanut butter). Then off down the trail again. I heard rain on the roof last night but it's just cool and overcast this a.m. We waved at the traffic from the I-90 overpass and got a horn blast from a passing semi. The big ups of the day take us over Becket and Walling mountains. The trail is rocky and rooty for much of the day, passing as it does through a lot of hemlock swamps and stands. We pass several ponds a day now, ringed with beaver-cut trees and studded with weathered lodges. 
Pete the caretaker told us that the ""gnats"" that have been bothering us are black flies. They are worse further north, but they are still annoying so we eat our PB pancakes under head nets. Around mile 11, we emerge near the home of the ""Cookie Lady,"" Marilyn, who often provides water and snacks to hikers. We spend a wonderful hour resting, eating and talking about a) the Missouri River and b) warblers. She really knows her birds! We're so energized that we are able to put in another few miles, finally stopping at a flat spot near yet another hemlock swamp.

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535339,"This morning we hiked our way into Dalton, MA after a midmorning break at Kay Woods shelter. We reach Dalton around 11:45 and the pub we'd hoped to visit isn't open yet. Instead we go next door to Sweet Pea's for ice cream and lunch, in that order. We are so full afterwards that we can't even order a second round of ice cream like we had planned. It's wonderful. Next, we spend an hour or so at the Dalton Laundromat, one of the nicest little laundromats I've ever been in. It also comes at a great time, since a couple of hours earlier, a small bottle of mouthwash in my pack overcame four layers of containment and drained out the bottom of the pack, soaking all my gear. Thankfully, this didn't happen when we still had five or six days until town.We also pick up some fresh foods for the next week. This means cheese, salami, tortillas, and a couple of apples and oranges. We'll pick up our packaged food resupply boxes tomorrow in Cheshire. After getting our town errands done, we head north on the trail to a campsite a few miles north of town. There's just one other hiker at the site, Justin, who is out for a 7-day section hike and is doing 17-20 miles a day.

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535576,"Not long after heading out this morning, we scared up a medium-sized dark animal in the woods by a beaver pond. It was a porcupine, quills raised, and it climbed up a tree with surprising speed. I had enough time to snap a few pictures from a distance. Then, after eating all of our remaining snacks for second breakfast, we headed down into Cheshire, MA. We found our mail drop packages stashed neatly at St. Mary of the Assumption church, which generously maintains a hiker hostel. Folks are preparing for a christening this morning, so we find a distant piece of lawn to open and repack our food drops. We never need every single thing we send ourselves - it's always an educated guess - so it's very nice that there is a food shelf donation box right there where we can leave the perfectly good food we don't need this time. (We often have extra oatmeal, instant potatoes and/or hot chocolate). 
In the afternoon we start climbing Mt. Greylock, the highest peak in MA. The switchbacks up the hemlock- clad ridge are the toughest. We had thought about staying in the hiker bunk room at Bascom Lodge, which is at the summit - but all the beds were booked by the Sierra Club, more's the pity. But life is good.

Tonight, dad's ""other half,"" Renee, will be joining us after teaching kayak rolling at Coney Island. This means all of the things we live for - time with loved ones, a meal jn a restaurant, a hotel, a SHOWER.   It has been eight days since the last shower. Five or six is tolerable, but this is beyond the pale. We cross the road to the summit of Greylock several times before reaching the top. As with many of the mountains in this area, the summit is forested. There is an observation tower (part of a veterans' memorial) but it is closed for renovations.   To walk right in to the beautiful CCC- era Bascom Lodge building, and dine on Eggs Benedict while gazing down over the mountain, is simply as good as it gets. There's no rush to get to North Adams so we linger at the summit and dawdle our way down the other side (which is much steeper). On the way down, we meet a couple in their early 80s who are very interested in our hike. The husband had hiked many sections of the trail until his knees gave out. They wish us all the best and he says rather wistfully, ""keep doing it for as long as you can!""By late afternoon we are in North Adams, where we are given a warm welcome at the Greylock Community Club.

The blackflies are waiting at the border with a sign that says ""Welcome to Vermont."" Then they try to drive their message home by biting it into our skin. We also cross one of those boulder fields (actually in MA) that's just a rubble of rocks with a single white-blazed tree at the top of the slope, as if to taunt us by saying ""find your own damn way across."" We call it a day at the campsite on top of Consultation Peak, and as we're finishing dinner, we hear a crashing sound in the woods. What first looks like a blackbird hopping up and down on top of a stump resolves into two twitching ears on top of a moose. Dad claps his hands and it trots off in a semicircle around our camp.

It looks like a horizontal strip of rainbow hanging in the sky. The folks waiting out the rain don't know what they're missing. At Melville Shelter, someone has left a pair of pantyhose full of fun-size Snickers bars. Risky, but exciting - they are completely unmoused. Wonderful trail magic!

We still need to stop and rest legs and catch our breath frequently as we ascend. At the top of the mountain, which is forested, there is a small caretaker cabin. It's our great good fortune that the caretakers, Hugh and Jeanne, just hiked up this morning for the season and arrived about 10 minutes before we did. We have a fantastic time talking with them. They have been the resident summer caretakers on the mountain, watching over things and greeting hikers, for 48 years. When I mentioned that I work for The Nature Conservancy, they both applauded!

Also, this shelter logbook goes back to last summer and I recognize some familiar names: Treebeard, Team Aussie Legs, Klank, Out on a Limb.

As we're coming down to Route 103, dad suddenly slips on a wet rock and goes head over heels. He lands face down with a pole pinned underneath him. I scramble down and tug the pole out so he can right himself. The biggest issue is his right forearm. The rock he hit tore a section of skin off the arm and it's bleeding freely. I am so glad now that I didn't take those never-used gauze pads out of my first aid kit. Plans have changed. We need to get to a clinic. Although it isn't an emergency, dad should have it looked at. Here's the amazing thing: at Minerva Hinchey shelter there was a sign on the board, saying ""if you need a ride to Rutland, call Trail Angel Tom, aka ""Plans too Much""."" I wrote the number down, thinking ""I won't need this, but who knows."" And thankfully, even on Memorial Monday, he picks up the phone, and within 30 minutes we are whisked off to the Clear Choice clinic in Rutland. Tom even waits for us while dad is examined! What an amazing guy. Verdict: a bit of bruising, and we'll need to re-wrap the injury on a daily basis.   Well, we are done for the day. And now comes the rest of the ""silver lining"": Tom takes us to The Hiker Hostel at Yellow Deli in Rutland, which is run by a Twelve Tribes spiritual community. There are men's and women's dorms, laundry, fantastic food (and conversation) in the deli, and even a generous welcome basket full of snacks and the best oranges we have had all hike.

It starts gradually, and at lunchtime we spot a note from Spunk in the Governor Clement shelter register - ""Treecycler and Kikker, where are you? Is everything OK?"" Now we are half a day out of step with her, and soon she will split off and follow the Long Trail. I am sorry we won't see her again.

We'll need to carry in our water, and that's always rough to add 4 or 8 pounds at the end of the day. And we do make it! Barely. It's funny how the milestone you're waiting for on the trail always comes at least three tenths of a mile later than you expect. Sometimes much more. But it is completely worth it. Besides having a fully enclosed cabin to ourselves, there is a platform high on top of the cabin roof from which you can get 360 degree views.

It's nice to know the thrus break a sweat on these steep climbs, too. It's another hot one today. The trail alternates between fields and woods for much of the day. Toward the end of the afternoon, we emerge on a road and walk through the town of West Hartford. As we're walking over the bridge crossing the White River, I spot a house along the road with an ""AT"" symbol on the garage. Just as I'm saying to dad ""That must mean something,"" a man on the front porch starts ringing a bell and making the international hand signal for ""Come have a drink!"" And so we meet Randy, who lives along the trail and invites hikers up on the porch for a cold soda and a chat. We spend a delightful hour talking about the trail, all the hikers they've helped, and the catastrophic effects of Hurricane Irene on this little town. When the hurricane hit in August of 2011, the level of the river was over the bridge, and Randy said it went from knee-high to chest high in 45 minutes. They had to evacuate the family and the hikers that were staying with them. One thing leads to another, and Randy says, ""Why not camp in our back yard? We'll cook up some hot dogs!"" I had hoped to do another couple of miles, and Randy's wife Linda says ""well, I'll drive you up the road to the trail crossing and you can walk back."" Brilliant! So we do our first southbound section, one mile from the interstate back to the Harts' house, without packs! Several other hikers stop and then continue up the trail, but we are staying. The Harts' grand kids play in our tent, and run around the yard with me. Then dad and I spend an hour wading in the White River before returning to the porch for more chat.

The drizzle sets in. It's tricky to keep sufficiently warm without overheating and sweating through the rain gear. I've found a welcome distraction- there are at least 5 types of ferns along the trail and I'm trying to memorize the differences until I can get to a field guide. We emerge on Elm Street and take a few minutes to say hello to trail angel Betsy and her husband. She coordinates a whole network of trail angels in the area and has been doing so for nearly ten years. We'll be staying with one of them, Greg, tonight.

An angry mother grouse comes charging at us with her ruff raised, and out of the corner of my eye I see some tiny balls of fluff go bouncing crazily into the undergrowth.

On the side trail back to the AT, there's a black pile that I don't remember from yesterday. Then I look ahead on the trail, and it's confirmed: BEAR. There is a yearling-sized black bear up ahead, near the stream that serves as water source for the shelter. Dad clicks his poles together and it bounds off up the hill. But in typical bear fashion, it then stops and watches us from a distance. For the rest of the morning, everything is a bear to dad, every black stump and toppled tree!Peregrine falcons are now nesting at Holtz Ledges, so we can't get too close to the ""precipitous drop-offs"" but there is a fantastic view from the side.

Bill was the legendary ""Ice Cream Man"" of the trail, offering hospitality to hikers who passed by his home for decades. Sadly, just two weeks ago, Bill died at the age of 87. Family and friends are keeping the trail magic going in the wake of his passing. There is ice cream in the freezer, Coke for next to nothing and a place to rest on Bill's porch. But it is clear that there is an emptiness, a loss at the center of it all and I can't help but shed a few tears - even though I was never lucky enough to meet him.The signboard at the road crossing before Sharps Mountain says there may not be water up top, so we very grudgingly carry water up a mountain again. The extra weight is quickly felt and we trade it back and forth to try to ease the burden. But Sharps really takes it out of me. It is sharp, and steep, and goes up, and up, and up. Exertion on this level makes me nauseated, but there's nothing for it - I have to keep going. Once on top, we are a bit surprised to meet a crew of two young men who are contracted by USFS to fix the cabin and the fire tower's roof.

The trail down from the top of Smarts Mountain is very slippery and muddy, and requires our constant attention. Dad steps on one log and it's atop a quagmire - he suddenly sinks down in mud up to his thigh! The other leg goes in to the knee.   Grabbing on to a trailside tree, he pulls himself out, but he is a sight to behold afterwards.And yet small things can be wonderful.   At the artfully designed Hexacube shelter, where we stop for second breakfast, we find three tiny pieces of trail magic: a new ziploc bag someone left (replacing one of mine that has shredded), a tube of orange drink flavoring that was left or forgotten, and a broom.   The broom is for sweeping out the shelter, but now that he has dried off, I can use it to sweep off dad.   I'd say we get rid of about 3/4 of the mud that is stuck to his clothes this way. The climb up Mt. Cube goes over several exposed rock faces and we get some excellent views. A couple of garter snakes are disturbed in their sunbathing as we pass (note: I think we have kept up the one-snake-a-day average, mostly through garter snake sightings). Up at the top of one such rocky area, we stop for lunch.   I may have mentioned before that everything in your pack constantly wants to leave you, kind of like the way that the One Ring abandoned Gollum.   For example, our car keys managed to work their way off a fastened clip. As I'm setting out my gear for lunch, my red food bag tips over and rolls off down the rock!   No!! It gets caught in some low trees about 20 feet away, and I'm able to retrieve it with a bit of clambering.   Another reminder that small mistakes can have big consequences! What would I have done if I'd lost it?It stays very windy all day and into the evening.

I'm anxious to get there and so I spend most of the morning completely in my own head, replaying scenes from favorite movies and books to break up the monotony.   We hike our way down the road to the hostel slightly before noon, earning a half day's rest.   There's no way we will tackle the tough climb up and over Mt. Moosilauke yet today.   Hikers Welcome is an AT hostel in the classic style - DIY and communal.   Claim a bunk, write down your charges on the sheet, use the outdoor shower and washer/dryer as needed, pop in a movie from the extensive DVD library while you're microwaving a mini pizza. They are in the process of building a new bunkhouse and it's looking great - four people are up on the scaffolding today, positioning insulation panels on the roof. 2011 AT thru-hiker Legion pretty much takes care of all of the daily operations of the hostel, and he says they hope to have it done in roughly a week. Legion knows the Whites inside and out, and his advice ends up convincing me to change our plan for the next day. I had thought we'd hike north over Moosilauke tomorrow to Kinsman Notch, call the shuttle service for a ride, and make our way to The Notch hostel in North Woodstock where our maildrop packages await.   Legion tells me that a) there's no reliable cell phone service at Kinsman, and it's a rotten place for a hitch, and b) the steep north side of Moosilauke is much better done SOBO than NOBO.   The long series of wooden ""steps"" along the waterfall (the Beaver Brook Cascades) are usually wet, and they are much better handled ascending than descending. In fact, Legion narrates a couple of us through the entire White Mountains, showing on the map where there's no water, where the trail goes above treeline, etc.   He has great suggestions for daily miles and stopping points for us ""slower hikers."" His knowledge is invaluable. I especially appreciate his statement that ""it's very hard to hike slower than one mile an hour.

Several of the thru-hikers are hiking Moosilauke NOBO today. The weather isn't good and we are all aware of the many challenges that the Whites are throwing at us today: cold, damp, wind, very rough terrain, above-treeline hiking, and poorly marked trails.

Around 7:30, Legion shuttles several of us (including Mac, dad and me) to Kinsman Notch to hike south over Moosilauke back to the hostel. He leaves us with a word of caution to watch the trail junctions; they had a hiker go astray, take a side trail and get lost well into the night only a week ago.The initial 1.5 mile climb is very steep and follows a lovely cascading waterfall that must descend nearly 2,000 feet. A few of the steepest sections of trail have rebar set into the rock, and several stretches have the wooden ""steps"" Legion told us about. Coming north, we meet several hikers we last saw about three days ago (Sixty, Sixty Also and Rusty), and later on, the first of today's NOBOs pass us.   Scrappy has probably done six miles by the time we cross paths - we've done two. But we're doing it.It never actually rains, but by the time the steepest climb is over (~3700 feet), we are in clouds and fog, and the chill is very real even though we are climbing.   We layer up and down constantly. There are hardly any signs of animals beyond some old moose droppings and the song of a distant thrush Approaching the summit, it looks like someone has dumped out ice chests under all of the stunted conifer trees - it's rime ice.   The day has warmed just enough for the trees to drop their coating of ice from last night. When we break treeline we get the full force of the wind, and we also understand why the trail markers have changed from white blazes to large rock cairns.   We can see from one cairn to the next, but not much further, with the fog. I keep losing sight of dad behind me, which is unnerving - it later turns out that he has a complaining calf muscle and his back is also sore since last night. There's no reason to stop here - no views, and even snapping a picture is tough. The wind is whipping my pantlegs like flags snapping on a pole.Halfway down the other side, the trail relaxes a bit and the sun starts to peer through the clouds. There's a short roadwalk, and the trail turns off on a forest road but the turn isn't marked at all - we find it purely by luck. One of the interesting parts of the day is crossing the creek right next to the road at the end of the day's hike - there is no clear route across without getting feet a bit wet, but dad heaves rocks into the gap to try to build a better crossing.

So we decide to take our first Zero day of the hike so far, to give him time to rest and stretch the muscles and generally try to alleviate the pain he's having. A total rest day is very welcome. There are so many ways to spend the time.   Sleeping and eating are our two favorites, and we do a lot of both. It's interesting how my food cravings have leveled off. There are a lot of food choices at the convenience store/deli several miles down the road, but none of them are particularly enticing.   It's all just fuel.We also do a lot of talking to other hikers and catching up on the trail journal. Mac has headed up the trail, and three fellows we chatted with from Florida also head out today, but other hikers are streaming in.   Early in the afternoon, Mouse and Legion place bets about how many other hikers will arrive today.   Legion guesses four, and soon the numbers start to mount - two, three, four, then six, seven, nine.   They open up the half-finished bunkhouse to house all of the new arrivals. I'm sitting at the table when a hiker walks in off the trail...and I recognize him!

I distinctly remember all of us hiking 11 miles before 11 am in order to get a ride in the back of a truck to the Dutch House hostel for free hamburgers.

We should have a pretty good idea of how and whether the back is coping with this strenuous hiking/climbing by then. The weather has not improved; we expect more cold, wind and mist on today's hike.Legion shuttles us to Kinsman Notch and we thank him for a great stay. He is going to be run off his feet with hikers for the next three-plus months.   Sure hope he can get a day off once in a while. So we're heading north again.

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538836,"I think today was the toughest day we have ever spent on the trail, and considering some of the days we have had over the past six sections/1,800 miles, I do not say that lightly. We left Eliza Brook shelter and climbed 2 1/2 miles to the top of South Kinsman Mountain. Everything was wet from last night's rain. Often, in order to look ahead at the trail, we were craning our heads and looking up. And up, and then we would come around the corner, and be staring up far above our heads again. Painfully slow going.   And with dad's back no better - perhaps worse - it was indeed painful for him, and worrying to me. It was not uncommon for the ""trail"" to be just a rock face with a crack in it that we had to climb however possible.   Sometimes I could reach out a hand and touch the trail ahead of me, which ascended so steeply that my next steps were at eye level. For the entire day we hiked with Wolfman, an experienced hiker of about dad's age, and there was some reassurance in hiking in a group and watching out for one another.   We were extremely aware that there were no ""outs"" in this section of trail.   If I had sat down on a rock and said ""that's it, I can't hike another step,"" I would still have had to swallow that feeling and go on. No road crossings to bail out on, and not even a flat space among the moss-draped boulder jumble on which to put a tent. The trail ascending South Kinsman was poorly marked, and once I turned back to tell the others ""I don't know whether I'm on the trail or just climbing up a creek bed."" Water was pouring down the rocks as we scrambled our way up. We came to a bog halfway up the mountain, traversed by puncheon (planking to help keep hikers out of the soft mud).   All of the puncheon was now under two or three inches of water.   There was no way to avoid walking through standing water, which was discouraging after all the efforts we had made to keep our feet dry. And then more climbing over huge rocks, grabbing saplings to lever ourselves up, and the wind whipping around us and chilling our sweaty bodies in an instant. We crossed the treeless top of South Kinsman quickly, but even then, dad had to hunker down when a strong gust of wind nearly knocked him over. This is the kind of weather in which one or two things going wrong can turn a tough day into a hypothermia situation. We took a late lunch at Kinsman Pond Shelter, where a posted weather forecast predicted temps in the mid-40s for the day, and winds from 50-70 mph! That was not on our forecast. We decided to push ahead to Lonesome Lake Hut, the first of the staffed AMC huts in the southern Whites. Descending from the twin Kinsmans was difficult, but we all agreed it was still much better than the ascent, and it went a bit faster. We vacuumed up all of the brownies that were for sale at the hut, and took a few minutes to sit down and collect ourselves. Then, off to do the final three miles of trail. A sign appearing shortly after the Hut noted that there was a bridge out ahead of us, and encouraged us to use other routes to get down to Franconia Notch.   Well, you don't have to ask us twice. We took the side trail to Lafayette Place Campground instead, which was a welcome 1.5 miles instead of 3.At Franconia Notch parking area, we got a humbling view of exactly how rugged these mountains are. The rock face of Cannon Mountain loomed over us, beautiful and imposing. Then our call to a shuttle service went through, and the three of us were whisked off to our respective hostels; Wolfman to Chet's and dad and I to The Notch.Suddenly we were a world away from the cold winds and rugged trail. It's like landing on another planet.   The hostel was clean and organized and we met Quaker, a hiker we've been tailing for a couple of weeks. The song lyrics he's contributed to the shelter registers have been fine reading.   I loved his question: ""Who is waiting for you when you finish your hike?""One big question now looms over our section hike: can we continue?   If my dad's back injury, whatever its nature, isn't clearing up, it seems foolish to continue into the Presidentials, widely considered the most difficult and possibly dangerous section of the AT. The Mt. Washington traverse is still ahead of us; so is Mt. Lafayette.   We do not want to be the next couple of hikers that have to be rescued off a windblown ridge.   Just days ago, two day-hikers had to be rescued off Franconia Ridge.   They were aided by another hiker (whose trailname is coincidentally also Wolfman, but not the same fellow we had hiked with).Dad's wincing whenever he stands up or sits down. We will take a second zero day tomorrow, and come to a decision.","Eliza Brook shelter

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538881,"Both dad and I learned very early in this trip that we couldn't expect any plan to go off exactly as intended. We have always hoped and planned as if we would reach Maine on this hike, but knew there were dozens of things that could pull us off the trail. Injury was always a possibility.   We made it through dad's arm injury and several lesser scrapes and punctures, all of which happened to him for some reason.In the end, the decision was easy. You can't fix a back injury with continued and strenuous backpacking, especially in the most difficult section of the A.T. So after a day of discussion, we decided to end the hike -- for now -- at Franconia Notch (Trail Mile 1816.0), and head back to Minnesota. I am sure the disappointment will come, but my first feelings were of relief. It's not fun hiking with a partner and watching them hurt. And dad has been hurting for days, although he has always put the best possible face on the situation.Our car is in Rangeley, Maine, some 150 trail miles ahead.   We had planned to hike back to the car, use it as a resupply point, and move it up the trail. Instead, we are able to connect with Golden Waldo, a Trail Angel out of Gorham, NH, who can shuttle us back up to it tomorrow. In spite of the change in plans, we're very happy with our progress.   This section hike (#6 since we first started at Springer) was our longest in terms of miles and days (37 days on the trail, 382 miles hiked). We put a lot of tough sections of trail behind us. We made it through mud, blackflies, snow, 90 degree heat and 30 degree cold. Saw moose, bear, porcupines and a rattlesnake. We met some of the most wonderful people we've had the good fortune to encounter anywhere along the trail - many, many Trail Angels, more than on any other section. And in spite of five weeks of extremely close quarters and tough situations, dad and I still like each other!   We have already started sketching out how we will tackle the Whites on our next go-round.   The adventure is always changing, and it isn't over....","Franconia Notch

I just weighed my pack, and I am shocked to find that (without water, admittedly) it is only 18.4 pounds.  That is a vision of heaven.  This has been the entire purpose of paying the Big Bucks to stay in the AMC huts - to cut weight.  We're still bringing all of our cold weather gear, the tent, sleeping bag, etc., but breakfasts and dinners will be provided at the huts.  That means we can cut out all of that food weight, plus cooking gear, the stove and fuel.  We are taking only the emergency pellet stove, a pot, and a dinner apiece if we have to spend the night in an unplanned location.
Because I am from Minnesota, I can naturally find the down side of any great situation.  My mind keeps whispering that I've left out something essential, something that I'll regret later.  But I've got to let that go.  And besides, he's here!","

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575448,"We were kindly shuttled to the trail by staff from the Notch hostel this morning, along with several other hikers, including thru-hiker Trek, who is also going hut to hut. The car will stay there until we come back for it in about four days. The day started out cool, and we needed it, as the trail soon started a nearly three-mile steep ascent up Franconia Ridge. We took a side trail to the top of Mount Liberty once we gained the ridge. There are a lot of people hiking the trail since the forecast is for clearing skies later today. 
We didn't realize it until yesterday, but many people are in the process of climbing the 48 peaks in New Hampshire over 4,000'. We have already done a few in last year's hike, so it sense to add Liberty to our growing list. 
Once we reached Little Haystack, we were above treeline and the vistas opened up on all sides. We're finally understanding the allure of the Whites - it's the hardest hiking we have done, but the Whites give us the feeling of being on top of the world! We inch forward, up and over Mt. Lincoln, and I am looking around and smiling the whole way. Smiling while hiking is a new thing. Usually I'm staring at my feet in intense concentration. We can see all the way to Mt. Washington today. Around us are dozens of peaks, forest-clad, some scarred by rockslides or ribboned with swaths of dead trees. The shadows of passing clouds slide silently over the trees on the slopes below us.
We can tell we're getting tired by the time we reach the top of Mt. Lafayette, at 5,260'. Our stay tonight is at an Appalachian Mountain Club hut 1.1 down a steep and rocky side trail - we can see it far below us from on top of the mountain. Muscles have been hurting in sequence today - legs in the morning, abs in early afternoon. On the way down it's the back that is aching, but no surprise there - this is a big first day. We roll in to the hut about half an hour before the croo serves us (and about 35 other guests) a huge dinner. A roof, a bed, good food - we couldn't be happier.","Franconia Notch

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575449,"We wake up at 6:30 to the croo (five high-energy college students) singing us a song outside of the bunk rooms . As we make our way to the dining area we see Lafayette is in the clouds. Over oatmeal, eggs and bacon, one croo member reads us the higher summits forecast from Mt. Washington. As we have learned, the weather in the valley can be completely different from what's happening up top. This sort of elevational weather awareness isn't something we develop in Minnesota. It's a whole new frame of reference. Today we'll be in the clouds but with some sun and winds from 25 - 40 mph. 
Dad and I expected the climb back up Lafayette to be grueling, but it's not as bad as expected. Still, it feels like we're lost on the rocky moors somewhere, with ragged clouds pouring over the ridge. The rocks above us appear and vanish into the clouds, over and over. But at the top we are rewarded - the clouds begin to break open and light begins to flood the valleys. One moment I'll see a line of hikers on the trail from Lincoln, but by the time I get my camera out, the clouds have obscured them again. 
We head north, just behind an adventurous family of three from Duluth that we met at the hut last night. The descent off the ridge rapidly takes all of our focus as it takes us over boulder piles and rock slabs. A misstep here (or anywhere) could cost us our hike. Second day aches are coming out, and this section of trail is HARD. We are learning to expect nothing else in the Whites. Every mile takes twice as long as we think it should. 
Yet there is a lot to enjoy - the views, the weather, the colors of the trail. When I am able to look around, I notice that a lot of the color right now comes from berries and mushrooms (most flowers are done for the year). Clintonia berries and bunchberry abound. The mushrooms in particular are amazing in vivid reds, yellows and deep indigo-purples. 
Today we barely make the hut by 6 pm dinner, footsore and spent. Dad goes right to bed afterward. Three blisters opened up on my feet today so some time is spent wrapping them with Leukotape. I spend a few chance minutes talking with a solo female thru-hiker, Queen Pee, about the challenges of the Whites, and the experience of hiking with fathers. She heads out into the darkness and within half an hour a thunderstorm descends. Hope she is safe and dry out there.","Greenleaf Hut

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575479,"This morning's climb is brought to you by South Twin Mountain. We leave the hut, fully cloaked in mist, and flip-flop with the Minnesotans and two people (Rick and Amy) pursuing peaks for their 4,000-footer list. At least it's not actively raining. The wind is pretty strong at the top of South Twin so we don't linger, but head back into the cover of the stunted spruce forest. By the time we reach Mt. Guyot, the bottoms of the clouds are starting to break apart and we see flashes of sun as the clouds swirl around us. The wind is still strong enough to make my pack cover snap like a flag on a flagpole. 
From here, the trail is a bit more moderate and as skies clear, we enjoy another beautiful afternoon. The hiking is so comfortable that we both find we're able to think about other things while walking - what route we will take back home, what we'll eat when we get to town. We get to the hut -situated next to lovely Zealand Falls, now a rather tame trickle - at 3:15. Lots of time left to lie on large rocks in the sun, take care of injured feet, and look at the colony of garter snakes that lives next to the hut (they're out sunning themselves in a large ball). The croo here is a volunteer group, filling in until the fall croo shows up in a day or so. The food they serve is amazing, perhaps the best we've had (there are debates about this since it has all been so good). I'm impressed by the number of family groups here, including one young hiker (with his mom) who's under three! Huts have a much different dynamic than in AT shelters, but it's very homey and warm.","Galehead Hut
",Zealand Falls Hut,"Aug 16, Wed",6.90
Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575954,"As a precautionary measure, we are carrying both tent and sleeping bags, even though we are hiking from hut to hut. Bad weather in the Whites has the potential to be really bad, even in summer. And our goals for mileage are just airy castles in the sky, loosely tethered to the rocky reality of these mountains. Other hikers prefer to go a different way, reducing pack weight even further by eliminating these items, since each hut provides bed, pillow and blankets. For us, we feel it's important to have the gear we need if we get stuck between huts some night in bad weather. We are not fast hikers, and we're okay with that. Quite honestly, a 25-pound pack is as good as a five-pound pack to me now. It feels so light I don't even notice it...not until it gets up around 28 or 30 pounds. The only time it really gets to me is when I am using hands and feet to lever my way up rock piles or rock faces. When I finally get myself up top, the sudden transfer of weight can make the pack swing from side to side, throwing me off kilter.
I slept in my sleeping bag on top of my bunk last night and it made for the best sleeping of the whole trip. Somehow, there is always a person snoring in my bunk room at every hut, and he's in the bunk below me. Earplugs (essential hiker gear) make all the difference. 
The hut croo made delicious scones as part of breakfast, a rare treat. I enjoyed spending a few minutes discussing letters of the alphabet with the angel-eyed hiking two-year-old. He didn't understand why we had to go, but to be honest, neither did I.
Ah, but it was a glorious morning. Cool, clear, FLAT trail, with the sun just cresting Whitewall Mountain, we make great time, stopping only occasionally for a handful of wild blueberries along the trail. For some time, we hike along the ""north fork of the east branch of the Pemigewassett River."" Dad is in the lead and is outdistancing me. Not a problem except that I want to stop at Ethan Pond shelter and he's nowhere to be found. I need the foot break, so I send a message up the trail with some thru-hikers we met that morning: ""tell my dad to slow down!"" We reunite for lunch at a trail intersection only 1.8 miles from the 302 road crossing at Crawford Notch. 
Once we emerge at the road-slash-Webster Cliff parking lot, we have another 1.8 miles to hike. Our goal is Dry River Campground, which is associated with Crawford Notch State Park, and it's a bit off trail. When you're ready to be done, the last few miles seem to take forever. So it is with us. But the campground is lovely and offers laundry and showers! John, who manages the site, is easygoing and helpful, even finding time to give us a ride down to the store a mile away.
After our dinner of sandwiches, I say to dad ""I'm beat. Is it about time for bed?"" ""Well, maybe - it's 5:36 pm."" ""OK, we need to stay awake until a reasonable hour...can we play a game? There's a volleyball net over by the laundry room."" One of the flat foam pads we use for sitting on wet rocks becomes our new frisbee. It flies like a wounded duck, but it does fly. Sometimes it even clears the net. I'm awake now, and my stomach hurts from laughing. Another camper eventually takes pity on us and lends us a real Frisbee. When we drop by his campsite to return it, we meet Ed and Betty and Heidi, friends from New Jersey. The experience repeats itself but it's always new - unfolding the story of our dad/daughter adventure, when it started and what remains. It's fascinating to see how people react and it tells us something about them. Some would love to do it; others - perish the thought! At the same time, they tell us a bit about their trip. We have a great chat before heading home to our tent. Hope it's snug - rain is in the forecast.","Zealand Falls Hut

We can catch the 8:45 AMC shuttle from Webster Cliffs and it will take us within a few miles of The Notch. Walking the shoulder of the road is a more direct route back, so we start walking at 7:15 and the 5th or 6th car passing by gives us a lift, saving us a mile or more. Now there's nothing to do but wait. Hey, is that the sound of rain?
It increases steadily and soon we're sitting hunched over on a big log, each trying to cover our entire bodies with just a rain jacket. We wait for an hour, since we arrived very early, but the shuttle comes just before we are completely soaked. More rainy-day kindness - the driver offers to take us directly to the hostel so we won't have to walk three miles in the rain. Thank you, thank you!
At the AMC Highland Center stop, the bus fills up and we meet B-Squared (thru-hiker) and Pirate (section hiker). As Pirate learns more about dad's kayak trip down the Missouri and his recent sojourn in Greenland, he has question after question for him. Their talk pretty much fills the two hours. I'm content to watch the rain-drenched, mist-covered mountains speeding by. Once the car is in hand, we are Free to do Many Things. Coffee stop - library visit for calls, Wifi and TJ posting - then a late lunch at the Woodstock Inn. After that, we head back to Dry River since we have laundry to do and showers to take. Our final run is back to Highland Center for dinner, since there are not a lot of options nearby.
We are powerfully glad not to be hiking on this washout of a day. It's the luck of the draw, but couldn't have worked out better.
Tomorrow we start the Presidential traverse - the section of the AT that goes over Mt. Washington (and over or near Mts. Monroe, Clay, Adams, Jefferson and Madison). The trail stays above treeline for more than a dozen miles and watching weather is crucial. This is our biggest challenge of the trip.

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576410,"I wake around four-thirty to the sound of increasing rain on the tent fly.  Ugh.  After that, my last hour of restless sleep has Rain Worry threaded through it.  Already we found our packs wet yesterday evening, and water leaking into dad's side of the tent.  But by the time the alarm goes off at 5:45, it is tapering off again.
We met two thru-hikers in the laundry/shower building yesterday - Mojo and Avalanche.  They're also heading north up the Webster Cliffs today, and with skills born of long practice, they yogied a ride from us in the morning after they learned we have a car.  We saw it coming and allowed ourselves to be talked into it - after all, we have been the beneficiaries of such kindness many times.  After packing up damp gear and a wet tent, we move the contents of the back seat into the hatchback trunk so we can cram in two more people and their packs. The rain has quit and sunbeams are playing spectacularly on the Frankenstein Cliffs as we drive our little clown car to the parking lot.  They thank us and head off quickly, while dad parks in the top lot, away from the road, and walks back down.  Two-tenths of a mile into our hike, I ask ""did you pull the cover across?"" - the one that conceals all of the items stored in the hatchback area.  He didn't, and after thinking about it, decides he needs to go back and take care of this. And this is why a good deed like giving two hikers a ride can come back to bite us.  It upsets the apple cart, throws us off our stride.  If we hadn't had to shovel all of our possessions into the back, we would have gone over the usual mental checklist and remembered to get everything squared away.  We've lost almost an hour by the time we start.
The climb up Webster is an elevation gain of about 2,700 feet over three miles.  With morning sunbeams slanting through the cool forest, we can actually see the water droplets that saturate the air, swirling with every breath we take.  We break out of the forest after about two miles to a spectacular view of Crawford Notch, the tiny Willey House with tinier motorcycles like a line of ants on the road below, and across from us, Mount Field and Mount Tom, marked by rockslide scars.  We can also see - and hear - the excursion train out of North Conway, threading its way through the forest and over trestles.  Wouldn't that be fun.
The movement of clouds is fascinating and we are at their level.  They pour down the valley and flow upslope towards us simultaneously.  But this morning sunlight is winning, and the clouds are lifting and breaking up.  A flock of four cedar waxwings flies up the slope and settles gently in a spruce tree behind us.  Then, effortlessly, they take off and plunge over the cliff like a bunch of of Acapulco cliff divers.  To them, it's nothing.  It makes my stomach lurch.
We climb higher and higher to gain the top of Mt. Webster, which seems to be backing away from us.  The climbing gets steeper and at one point, we see the trail follows an exposed spine of rock that juts out of the tree cover.  Looking only at the rock, I focus on just the next step - the next handhold.  Not the sweeping views that give me a wobbly feeling if I look away from solid ground.  I am officially no longer afraid of heights, not if I can do this...
Somewhere in the next mile, it finally happens.  We meet a bearded fellow heading south along an exposed ridge, and dad asks ""do you know Norm Miller?"" ""Norm Miller!"" the hiker cries.  Norm is a member of the Missouri River Paddlers, and that clinches it.  This is the trail-famous hiker dad's been looking for - Greybeard!  At 82, he is out here endeavoring to be the oldest hiker ever to thru-hike the Trail.  He only has about 400 miles left to hike, so he's knocking on the door.  Last year, he paddled the length of the Mississippi, and the Missouri River may be next - hence his connection with the paddling group.  And Dad has been a member of the group for years, so he knew Greybeard was out here and hoped to find him.  Amazing.  We stop to chat and take selfies.
After another long break for views and lunch, we realize we need to get cracking to get to the hut by dinnertime - still 3 miles to go. Mount Jackson, like everything, was soaked by yesterday's rain and apparently it doesn't drain well.  On the flats there are mudholes and puncheon, and by the time we reach the hut, our muddy legs are like badges of honor.  The hut is a hive of activity as we try to find a bit of space to dry shoes and socks and tents.  And suddenly we are in another world again.  I think our tablemates for dinner are Boston lawyers, and nearby is a former president of the AMC.  That's great, but mostly I just want to wash my legs.","Route 302
",Mizpah Spring Hut,"Aug 19, Sat",6.40
Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576888,"The hut croo at Mizpah Spring is clearly the winner when it comes to skits!  Every morning after breakfast, the croo at each hut presents a skit that creatively incorporates three themes:  pack out your trash, fold the blankets on your bunk, and...tip the croo.  This morning's ""Yoga Class"" skit was far and away the winner among all six huts we visited...creative, and truly hilarious.  Yes, I did tip.

Our hike today is short in terms of mileage (only 4.6), since staying at Lakes of the Clouds will set us up to climb Mount Washington first thing tomorrow morning.  We appear to be in a cloud from the start, and climb through the moss-carpeted forest, adorned with stands of ghostly indian pipe.  Climbing Mt. Pierce (or Mt. Clinton, it's currently under debate), we notch another four-thousand footer. I heard from a fellow hiker that the A.T. hits sixteen of the 48.  We already had three (Moosilauke and the Kinsmans) from 2016, and now we are racking them up at an impressive rate, considering that we didn't even know it was a ""thing"" until a week ago.

However, when we get to the Mt. Eisenhower loop trail, we learn the summit is not on the A.T. So we have to decide:  do we take the loop trail to the top?  We'd get another 4,000-footer for the list, but would have to backtrack to the A.T. so we don't miss a section of it.  A short discussion is followed by an easy decision:  skip it, conserve the energy.  We need our reserves for climbing Washington tomorrow, still a formidable task.  

The clouds are starting to lift (from the bottom up) by the time we stop for the mid-morning Builders bar.  How much do you want to bet that it's sunny down in the valley?  Based on the morning forecasts that are declaimed by a member of the croo each morning, it seems like it is always sunny there. 

We're amazed to reach Lakes of the Clouds hut before three, so for once we have the luxury of more than 15 minutes before dinner. I have been looking forward to a late-lunchtime bowl of soup for the past two miles.  There is another copy of ""Women on High"" in the hut library, about groundbreaking female mountain climbers in Europe and the U.S. I started reading it back at Zealand Falls Hut, so I'm pleased to pick up where I left off.  A good book, plus dry socks and a cup of hot chocolate - life couldn't be better. The hut is a hive of activity - it houses up to 90 people, and this is peak season.  Eventually, besides the full slate of paying guests, some eight or ten thru-hikers also touch down here, hanging out on the benches by the bathrooms. There is an unmistakable funk in the air around them.  After more than 1,850 miles of trail, it's unavoidable.  I think they plan to spend the night in ""the Dungeon.""
We have the time to rest, but space is at a premium - you can stake out a spot at a table, or read in your bunk with a headlamp.  It has been very windy up above treeline all day, no surprise, so spending the time outside isn't in the plan.  I do brave the elements for one thing, though. Mount Washington is to one side of us, its head in the clouds.  Mt. Monroe is looming above us to the other side.  With about forty minutes until dinner, I'm rested enough to take poles and gloves and race up the Monroe summit trail to the top - it takes about 15 minutes up and the same back down.  It is glorious, and without the pack I feel as light as air.  There's no one on the trail, and the vistas are fantastic on all sides.  I can look out from the rugged top of the mountain and see the snaky trail that we will take tomorrow up the flank of Washington. So much for conserving energy, but it was worth it.  On the way down, I'm surprised to see a charcoal-colored furry caterpillar crossing the path, sometimes being rolled across the ground by the wind - what a tough place to make a living. 

Dinner is good, but the croo seems stretched to their limit, managing so many people.  Some of the foods don't make it to every table.  But for once, the dessert is not lemon cake! The last four days have seen a lot of variations on that theme. 

After dinner, Dad and I get our packs organized and ready so we can head out right away in the morning.  It will be a full day for us getting to Madison Springs Hut, and we'll need all the time we can get.","Mizpah Spring Hut

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577440,"I wake up, and it's pretty clear - I'm getting a cold.  Staying in close proximity with so many other hikers at the huts may have done it.  So add sneezing and nose-blowing to the regular list of challenges expected when climbing Mt. Washington. 
We get out on the trail as soon as possible after breakfast, heading up into the swirling mist.  The forecast for today is very good - light(er) winds, only 25-40 mph at the top, with clouds and fog expected to burn off as the day progresses.  We immediately pass the two high-altitude lakes for which the hut is named, and shortly after that, we see the famous ""worst weather in the world"" sign that warns hikers to ""turn back now if the weather is bad.""  We feel fortunate to have a good day, whether or not we get a view from the top.  Many people are climbing Washington today, and it starts to feel like we're spending half of our time standing beside the trail, waiting for faster hikers to pass us.  However, the trail itself isn't bad -- certainly, it's not the roughest or steepest we have seen.
From the hut to the top is only a mile and a half.  We see a couple of brief glimpses of sun, but as we take the summit trail, the clouds thicken and the wind speed ratchets up.  As we close in on the summit, we hear much better than we see - wind is roaring in the antennas that crown the mountain, and disembodied voices from a nearby maintenance crew swirl around us.  We can't see structures at the top until we practically stumble over them.  In the restored Tip Top House, the hotel that dates back to 1853, I skim the guest book.  My goodness, there's a gal from Lester Prairie up here this morning!  As they say, small world.  Most importantly - we take pictures next to the sign on the very summit, so that now it is official - we climbed it!!
The observatory houses all manner of things you wouldn't expect to see on the top of a mountain: a post office, museum, gift shop, hot dogs. It's 10 am, and dad and I agree to take one hour to savor the summit.  We text friends and family to say we've made it, and then put together a nice early lunch while watching the kaleidoscope of humanity around us.  There are visitors who drove up the auto road, and others who took the cog wheel railway.  We can tell the folks who didn't arrive here under their own power.  They're mostly wearing shorts. 
Around 11 we head up the trail, in tandem with a N.H. resident we chatted with at lunch.  He knows his alpine plants, and suggests that the white-flowered plant I saw along the summits on Franconia Ridge is mountain sandwort.  As we hike from cairn to foggy cairn, he also casually notes, ""to our right, just over there, is a 3,000-foot drop.""  Oh my.  Perhaps it's better we can't see anything.   
We cross the flanks of Mt. Clay and Mt. Jefferson - we don't shoot for the summits; no extra steps today. Near Jefferson, we realize it's about time for the eclipse to begin.  We're swapping trail position with a group of three male hikers, and they let us borrow their eclipse glasses to see the shadow start to creep across.  The next time we see them, they give us one of their pairs of glasses - incredibly kind!  So we, in turn, share them with anyone that passes our way. About 75% of the sun is covered at its fullest extent, with just a fingernail-clipping of light at the top of the disc.
Our hardest work begins after this.  The last 2.5 miles around Adams are extremely rugged, and the soles of our feet are hurting like crazy. Not to mention many other muscle groups. The hike from Thunderstorm Junction to the hut contains some of the longest tenths of a mile I've ever hiked.  We are glad to have some fantastic views in the afternoon, as the clouds have mostly lifted.  Even so, we're wiped out by the time we hit the hut.  Without realizing it, I've let myself get dehydrated, and so I down a lot of liquids to fight off an incipient headache and nausea. I hadn't thought about how much water you lose by blowing your nose all day.
Two thru-hikers are hanging out on the steps, waiting for work-for-stay.  It's awkward to be eating the fabulous dinner prepared by the hut croo, while avoiding the eyes of the hungry-looking hikers on the other side of the glass. I feel like I should open the window and hand them a bowl of soup. Most of the time on the A.T., all of us hikers are pretty much equal - we get soaked by the same rainstorms, and sleep side-by-side in the same shelters.  But in the Whites, the huts are the one place where class and money enter back in to the equation.  It's a strange feeling.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577891,"One of dad's trekking poles snaps in half while we're getting our gear ready.  Sheesh, we haven't even started hiking yet.  He jury-rigs it back together using tape and the physics of telescoping poles. I have always admired this about dad - his ability to engineer solutions to sudden, unexpected problems. With luck, it's enough to get him/us down to Pinkham Notch, a little under 8 miles away.We begin our climb up Mount Madison in shadow, as the sun has not yet crested the mountain.  The sun hits us just as we're reaching the top, and then we thread our way over boulders aplenty, hopping precariously across the spine of the mountain.  Ahead of us, a young couple with four children, all apparently under the age of seven, are enjoying the mountaintop views at the summit.  I am in awe of anyone with the chutzpah to bring four kids up to the top of this windswept rock pile - one of whom is carried on mom's back.  And the kids are amazing.  As we all begin the long, extremely rugged and increasingly hot descent, I can't help but think about the fact that the kids have to take two or three steps for every adult stride.  They are clambering from boulder to boulder with their tiny backpacks on their backs.It's a slow grind and I'm longing to get back into the krummholz, where there's a bit of shade.  Our minds are focused only on the next step, the next short descent down a steep rock, or finding a good route between us and the next cairn. We can see clear to the top of Mt. Washington and down from the ridge on all sides.  It's majestic - a concept which starts with beauty, but then adds in a layer of forbidding austerity.  We are not of this place.  It doesn't care about us and would easily shrug us off like a couple of flies.  Dad's other pole gives up the ghost shortly thereafter.  The internal cord that strings it all together finally let go.  One of dad's water bags has also sprung a leak, and both the load lifters on my pack have quit lifting so I have to tie knots in them.  Our gear seems to be giving up on us. Soon we're finally enjoying the cool respite of the trees, although the descent continues to be steep.  When we stop for a late lunch at 1 pm at Osgood Tent Site, it's discouraging to see that we've only come three miles in four hours.  We still have almost five miles to go.  The next section is marked by a confusing series of trail crossings and a lack of white blazes (we're in the Great Gulf Wilderness, where such markings are prohibited).  I loved the views atop Madison, despite the hard hiking, and I'm glad we stopped to enjoy them.  Even so, I'm starting to feel the insidious pressure of many miles to go, both of us getting tired, and a morning weather forecast that contained the words ""afternoon thunderstorms."" Our next waypoint is the Mt. Washington Auto Road.  It's reassurring when I finally reach it, but I'm so beat I would gladly thumb a ride to the Lodge and skip the next two miles. Thankfully, the last 1.9 follows the ""Old Jackson Road"" and is much easier hiking than anything that came before. We pass the delightfully named ""George's Gorge Trail"" about a mile from the lodge. Who came up with that?  I want to meet them.We're here!  Hikers of every description are milling around, returning from day hikes, getting shuttled to other trailheads.  As for us, we have a two-person room, we're in before the storm (a delicious feeling) and there are showers, a dining hall, beautiful library - everything we could want (except laundry, but we don't need that just yet).  Now comes some decision-making.  We have made it through the Presidentials. We're beat. We need to replace some gear. The last phase of the hike will take us three days (over the Wildcat peaks and out at Gorham) with no real chance to exit early.  And we've recently learned that there is a surprise 80th birthday party for my aunt, dad's oldest sister, in Michigan on Saturday.  If we leave a bit early, we can still make it there in time for the party.  All signs are pointing in the same direction.So we decide: this is it, the end of the section for 2017.  We can't miss the family gathering. One thing the trail has taught us is ""adapt to changing conditions.""  There's no sadness in saving the Wildcat peaks for next time - no, we are grinning like idiots and congratulating each other for finally having climbed Mt. Washington.  We did it!  As a ""coda"" to our adventures, we take the cog wheel railway to the top of Mt. Washington the next day and enjoy some extra time for views and the museum. A lone hiker is making his way down the trail toward Mt. Clay.  Good luck to all of you still making your way up the trail - thru-hikers, LASHers, section hikers and day hikers alike.  What a fantastic trip.   We'll be back.","Madison Springs Hut

Sometimes I think our AT hike is a bit like this. The two-day road trip from Minnesota to Maine this time threw some new things in our path, quite literally. A boat, thrown off a trailer, blocking a lane and a half of traffic near Madison. So much rain and subsequent delays around Chicago that we ended up driving nonstop straight through the night. A road rally that lined the back roads and filled the restaurants in Rangeley, Maine. With each new twist, dad and I turn to each other and say “Ouch, OK, now what should we do?” And it’s both one of the challenges and joys of the trail – whether deciding our route on the highway or choosing our next move at the top of the mountain, we figure out a way to adapt and flex with whatever is thrown at us. Today was beautiful, and tomorrow, our first day back on the trail, is expected to be rainy. So be it. We are ready to start putting one foot in front of the other.",,"Rangeley, ME","Jul 21, Sat",0

In order to keep on “schedule” and get to the hut tonight, we ended up driving ourselves to Pinkham Notch. Now the car is nearby, which could be good. We’ll just have to figure out later how to get it back up to Rangeley.
Climbing Wildcat Ridge in the rain is something I can now say that I’ve done, and therefore never need to do again! That was a tough first day. Only six miles, but by the end my hands were dirty and covered in leaf litter from all the hand-over-hand rock climbing we did to gain the ridge. Most of the time our poles just got in the way. Very strenuous hiking, and while we are exhausted, it feels great to be able to say We Did It!! We hiked in drizzle and clouds - it been very dry here, so the rain is needed. But it adds another layer of analysis to every step on to a wet rock (and that’s essentially every step).
My pack cover, it seems, is more of a water collection device; it pooled at the bottom and soaked my sleeping bag. Normally that would be pretty scary since I count on it to warm me up once we camp. That is one of many reasons we’re so glad we stayed at Carter Notch Hut tonight. The croo made us a delicious dinner, and the bunkhouse allowed us to air-dry some wet gear, including the bag.

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599034,"Usually a good meal and a good night’s sleep will do wonders for a tired body. Clearly the Wildcats took it out of me, because when we start our big climb up Carter this morning, that wobbly-legged fatigue feeling is still there. I’m hoping I can make it through the full seven miles.
It’s another drizzly, rainy day but we see something on the climb up that makes it worthwhile. In among the balsam firs and lichen-encrusted rocks, there’s something tiny and gray, hopping. Suddenly it races up a tree and flings itself onto the neighboring trunk. It climbs out on to a branch and I’m face to face with a flying squirrel. It has big dark eyes and I can see the flap of furry skin that makes the “wing” between its front and back legs. Then it races down the tree trunk and starts looking for food on the ground. What a treat.
We meet a fellow section hiker, Feather, on the way up Carter as she is headed down. There’s a certain empathy with everyone else who is out here on a day like this. Feather’s enthusiasm helps me get to the top of the mountain. From there we stay on the ridge, crossing over Mt. Hight and then South, Middle and North Carter. Soon the water pooling on the trail is so deep that there’s no point avoiding it - we tromp straight through and it comes over the tops of our boots. Then comes a series of steep descents down rocky channels that have become small rivers...one is essentially a climb down a waterfall. Imp Campsite is a welcome sight and we immediately change into our driest clothes. The shelter is full to capacity.","Carter Notch Hut

The clouds are still thick when we clamber to the top of Mt. Moriah, and the wind is whipping at my ill-fitting pack cover. If it weren’t littering, I would be entirely fine if the wind ripped the darn thing off and carried it away. 
On the tops of mountains and ridges, we find a lot of two-plank boardwalks that get us over bogs and mudholes. Apparently the sides of the mountain have better drainage than on top. Some of these have started to decay, and logs or branches have been thrown into the mud as a workaround. Crossing one of these on a spruce log, using both poles for balance, is like walking a tightrope. 
We notice the temperature ticking up bit by bit as we descend from almost 4,000 ft elevation to 780 by the time we reach Route 2.

I’ll be frank for a moment...I am pretty much done listening to other hikers tell us how tough the trail is up ahead. For years others instilled the awe/dread of The Whites and Mt. Washington. Or if not Washington, then the Wildcats (peaks A, B, C, D and E!). Once we conquered those, someone tells us how bad the climb up Mt. Success is. We make it through that (not so bad) and even complete Mahoosuc Notch, rightfully known as the hardest (or at least slowest) mile on the AT, and someone’s already talking about the agony of the climb up Mahoosuc Arm.

we'll stop at Full Goose Shelter to get set up for Mahoosuc Notch
tomorrow. Approaching Mt. Carlo, we are delighted to watch a kettle of some twenty
ravens, diving and frolicking in the updraft funnelling up the west
side of the rocky peak. Further along, near the top of Goose Eye, we
have a long and inspiring talk with two hikers out for the day who
have done a number of sections of the trail in this area. On hearing
dad's age and the fact that we've hiked everything from Georgia to
here, the younger hiker tells his mid-60s companion, “see! You can
do it!”  Upon hearing this, the wry grin and sag of his shoulders has to be seen
to be believed.
There are steep sections to be conquered today,
some of which are handled with steps set into the rock, and in one
place, with a rebar “ladder” that climbs the rock surface, rung
by rung. Once again I'm in a section where it's hard enough to hike
it myself – focusing only on the vertical rock slab in front of my
eyes, inching forward and NOT looking back or down. But to watch dad
do it is simply not possible. I make the top and mill about, looking at
the view, studying the ground, and waiting to hear his footsteps behind me
– just not a shout or a crash, please!
The shelter is
positioned on a rock “plateau” slightly above the surrounding
forest. We grab a tent pad. There are lots of SOBOs here, loud and happy, rejoicing that they're thru the Notch. Dad's snoring lately is keeping me up, so we
decide to put up the tent for him tonight and I will stay in the shelter. 
One worry today is that our water flow in the filter is slowing down. Asking to borrow a backflusher at the shelter, a passing NOBO gives us her backflush attachment for her Sawyer. She says she doesn't need it back because she'll be finished with the trail in a few weeks. I thank her, but still plan to return it, only to find when we are finished that she's already left the shelter, heading into Mahoosuc Notch in midafternoon. That's hardcore. Thank you, thank you, unnamed thruhiker. This little piece of equipment saves us two or three times before the end of this trip. 
During evening chores, I have a chance to talk to Next Step and hear his NOBO story. His wife hiked with him for the first thousand miles or more, but had to leave the trail due to injury. He's keeping a detailed trail journal and clearly carrying her with him in his heart every day. His enthusiasm is contagious and it's always wonderful to talk to another hiker who is taking notice of the plants and animals that share this place with us.","Carlo Col Shelter
",Full Goose Shelter,"Jul 29, Sun",4.40
Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603880,"I start the day trying not to dwell on
the trail register entry that said “I'd hike through Mahoosuc
Notch five times before I will climb up Mahoosuc Arm again.” We
start early and begin with an up-and-over of the south peak of
Fulling Mill Mountain, stopping around 9 am at the stealth campsite
at the south end of the Notch. We're feeling good, it's a good
weather day and we have lots of time.  Right now, it's all about
staying positive and waiting for the Notch to reveal its challenges
to us. Grumpy and then Next Step pass us, and we learn from the
latter that they will go through together. Many people pair up so
they can work in tandem to pull packs through narrow openings, etc. The first look at the Notch is amazing. As we make our way in, we
see steep-sided cliffs towering over us on both sides, from which
boulders have been raining down for centuries. Trees are sprouting
out of cracks in the vertical cliff walls hundreds of feet above our
heads. Piles of boulders are all over, some as big as cars, some
bigger. They are stacked and piled atop each other with holes
plunging down between, and cool air breathing out of them. Vegetation has grown over them and in places, tree roots form a
bridge between boulders, with a ten or twelve-foot drop beneath. 
As we begin, we follow our mantra from
the first section hike in 2008 - “Start Slow, Then Taper.” Dad
and I pick our way slowly through the maze, stopping to assess the
best route to the next white blaze, waiting for the other to catch
up. At one point we decide we need to lower the packs down on ropes
because the descent is too steep for us. Twice as we wend our way
through, we peer down into the holes between boulders and see ice at
the bottom. At the end of July. Once we see fog spouting from a
deep crevice. It is an incredible
spot, unlike any other on the trail. 
The vegetation here is 2-3 weeks behind
– for example, the bunchberry plants here are still in flower. Everywhere else, and especially on mountaintops with full sun, they
have ripe red berries. At one point, balancing on a boulder and
deciding where to step next, my red neck bandana is buzzed by a
hummingbird. It hovers in front of my face for the briefest of
moments before darting off. Lucky I didn't take a wrong step from
surprise. Another high point is the crawl underneath a huge boulder
which requires taking off the packs and dragging them through behind
us. Then we have to push them out a small hole and squeeze ourselves
out the opening. 
We meet a few high-spirited summer camp
groups here, and several small knots of hikers heading both north and
south. Secure in our knowledge that we are Super Slow, we let them
pass. It takes us 3 ½ hours, but we get through without injury. There's another stealth campsite at the north end and we have a late
lunch there. Although more than half the day is gone, we've only
done 2.7 miles, and we're not ready to stop for the day. The climb
up Mahoosuc Arm seems endless, though it's “only” another 2.4
miles to Speck Pond Shelter & Campsite. The climb is mostly over
smooth, steep rock and it's often wet from the water weeping down the
mountainside. I know I'm tired when I start overestimating how far
we've come. 
Speck Pond
Campsite is the most northerly one with an AMC caretaker. We pay our fee and chat
with him for a time, and also with several of the fourteen-year-old
girls who are on an end-of-session hiking trip for their summer camp.
We also run into Next Step, and he tells us that earlier in the day,
Grumpy fell on the first boulder in the Notch, and dislocated his
shoulder! Aaagh. He had to hike through the whole Notch that way, with Next
Step carrying/dragging his pack. Then Grumpy had to hike another
seven or eight miles to a road just to get medical attention, where
his wife met him and took him to a hospital. Our thoughts are with
him, and we're grateful that we made it through without trouble. And
that it is once and for all BEHIND US, happy day!","Full Goose Shelter

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604484,"This morning we say goodbye to Next
Step, since we're not sure if we will see him again in Andover, or if
he will be far ahead of us. The first mile is spent climbing to the
summit of Old Speck Mountain. The pictures I take at the time never
represent the reality: the dizzying feeling of climbing a bare,
sloping rock face, the wind that buffets us when suddenly there are
no trees to slow it down. Often we climb with hands and feet even
when it isn't strictly necessary – we like to have more stability
(and points of contact). 
A side trail to an observation tower
beckons. Dad isn't interested, and I'm ready to push on past, but he
asks me if I will regret it if I don't go. It's a fair question. I
realize that Yes, I would like to see the view, even though 0.3 miles
is pushing my limit for optional mileage. Dropping my pack, I fairly
sprint up the trail, but pull up short when I see a strange bird by
the side of the trail. It's a spruce grouse, chicken-like and
forest-colored, but with thick red eyebrows, and it's unimpressed by
my presence. It stalks through the mossy spruce and balsam forest
and pecks enthusiastically at a red russula mushroom. The grouse
encounter is even better than the view from the top of the tower - so
close! By the time I return to where dad is perched, he has managed
to meet gather four hikers around him in conversation - two hiking
couples, including a pair of Minnesotans. Our home state is
well-represented out here. The other, younger couple has also
encoutered spruce grouse, including a mother with small chicks. 
From here we have a long descent of
about 2,500 feet to Gorham Notch. We pass a three-tiered waterfall
along the way. There is much to delight at the Notch, including a
nice privy and trash cans, and parked cars from nearly every state in
New England. It feels so good to get rid of a bag of garbage, even
if it's contributing almost no weight to the pack. From here we hike
to Baldpate Lean-to, which sets us up to go up and over Baldpate
tomorrow.","Speck Pond Shelter & Campsite

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604485,"We have two tasks today: climb Baldpate
Mountain, and emerge from the woods at East B Hill Road in time for
our shuttle pick-up at 5:00. I think we have bumped our reservation at
Pine Ellis Lodge out by a day three separate times, and now we're
finally, finally going to make it in. They have been so
accommodating that I really don't want to make them wait. The
Baldpate climb is like Old Speck – steep and occasionally
vertigo-inducing, with fantastic views – but it's much windier
today. 
We
can see the cairns leading the way up the mountain, but it's not
always clear which is the best way to get to the next one. Usually I
can tell the trail's route over rock faces, because the lichen has
been scrubbed off by all of the boot traffic. Not so here – there
are often multiple routes. Should I take the long, steady incline or
the craggy seam here? Do I tell dad which route worked for me, or
leave it up to him? I still can't shake the feeling that one of
these times, I'll look back at dad just in time to see him go rolling
down the mountainside. But I don't want to distract him with a lot
of fussing, so I generally just stay within hailing distance. 
I
think we're better than we used to be at acknowledging and
“celebrating” every day and every mountain that we complete
without injury. When we hike a tough section of trail, we usually
stop to talk about how it went, and what was difficult, when we take
the next breather. Often it's the same thing for both of us – the
slipperiness of wet rocks; wind catching at our packs and throwing us
off balance. It's sunny and windy at the top of Baldpate, both cold
and warm simultaneously. Another great day for hiking. The sign says 6.3 miles to the road. 
Although
such things have been more precious than gold in previous hikes, I
didn't bring a paper book on the trail this time. Instead, I have my
iPhone, but I rarely use it, in order to keep it near 100% battery
life. Once we're only a few days from town, I do treat myself to
some Jane Austen as I did last night, reading it in the gathering
gloom of the shelter. Pride
and Prejudice
and Persuasion
are favorites. I have been replaying scenes in my head while hiking,
tuning out the little miseries of the trail by trying to remember the exact
dialogue and character descriptions. One layer of my brain is making
a tally of the hike: slippery
root, red
mushroom, sharp rock, reindeer lichen, mudhole
and an entirely separate layer is reflecting that Elizabeth's
astonishment was beyond expression.
There
is the most amazing river gorge at Dunn Notch – severe cliffs and a
precipitous drop that is half hidden by trees. We can hear the cascade.  I don't want to go
too close, because it sure looks like a long fall. 
Dad and I pop out at the fabled East B Hill road and face a dilemma. Our
shuttle is there, nearly an hour early, with a third hiker already in
the van! BUT there's also a table full of trail magic! Two NOBOs who
recently summited Katahdin, and two SOBOs, have together created the most amazing
spread for hikers – there are drinks, bananas, brownies,
and even tabbouli. Why not do both? I take a minute to gather up
some portable magic and thank the magicians behind it, and tell them
about the journey that dad and I are taking together. Because that's
the currency we use to repay the generous people on the trail who
cannot fully be repaid – our stories. Then we are into the van and down
the road, bumping and jostling all the way to town.
At
Pine Ellis, we get signed in and start the imperatives. Gather up
the laundry (everything!). Grab some loaner clothes from the box.
Get laundry started. Find maildrop packages and unpack them.

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599667,"Gloria drops us off back at South Arm road this morning, and on the south side of the road, the stones we used to hop across Black Brook two days ago are submerged under frothing water. Glad we’re not hiking south today.
The trail profile from Wyman Mountain down, over Moody Mountain and up Old Blue basically forms the letter “W”. We are climbing the last arm of the W this morning. Pretty quickly we are up high enough to see the road snaking away and hear the rush of the brook in the distance. The trail is sodden and moisture is thick in the air. That also means we see some remarkable spider webs.
Following a pattern of “climb-pause-breathe-drink” eventually gets us to the top. From there, we skirt Elephant Mountain and ascend Bemis Mountain on a trail that’s always rocky, muddy and wet. That’s Maine, and we might as well get used to it. 
By end of day (5 pm) we’re pretty worn out, but not yet at the shelter. Then the trail throws a few surprises at us. First, we come upon a family of half-grown spruce grouse scattered in a section of open, rocky ground. Tearing ourselves away from watching them, we are soon stopped by blueberry bushes heavy with fruit...so of course we answer their call. Another tenth of a mile later, we come across a tiny brown rabbit sitting directly on the trail. It’s obeying its rabbit programming to “freeze” when danger approaches, but I can see it quivering. We step past it and when I look back it is already gone. 
We finally reach the site around 6pm. The water source is very close to the shelter and running well. And the privy is big enough to hold a dance in.  We’re the only two people in the shelter tonight- a first for this trip.","South Arm road

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599884,"Coming
down off Bemis Mountain is a long, multi-stage descent over rocky
slabs, some of them steeper than we would like. Blueberry bushes are
still a distraction but mostly we are watching our feet. We employ
several convenient and much-abused trees to lower ourselves down some
steep sections of rock.
We're
stopped for morning snack/second breakfast when a hiker comes up the
trail with an important bit of news. There is trail magic not 100
yards ahead of us! So we hustle down there and are greeted by a
cooler of snacks and cold water, courtesy of Gregg and Geri. How
wonderful – thank you! There's another special piece of magic –
a mirror hanging from a tree, so we can see what the heck we look
like right now. 
We
ford our first stream of the A.T. at Bemis Pond. Kind of amazing
that we've managed to cross on rocks or bridges for every single
water crossing up til this point. Thank you, trail maintainers. The
water is below the knees at its deepest, although flowing quickly in
the middle. We were advised to wear camp shoes as we walked across,
and NOT cross with bare feet. 
It's
pretty warm as we climb towards ME 17, Height of Land; I'm sweating
for sure. We stopped at the turnout to enjoy this amazing overlook
when we first drove into Rangeley, and it feels great to know that we
have now hiked all the way back to it under our own power. The view
over Lake Mooselookmeguntic is breathtaking. We make this our lunch
stop, and fill in with a few wild raspberries. We're also getting
close to “home,” meaning our car and all of its supplies.  That feels great, too.
3.8
more miles to Sabbath Day Pond lean-to. All along this section from
South Arm Road to ME 4, it's difficult to get a good hiking pace
going because of all of the mudholes. If we were thru-hikers I guess
we would tromp right through them, but we still expend time and
energy trying not to get soaked or turn into mudballs. We do see a
lot of colorful mushrooms along the trail as we're watching the
ground. Plus some beautiful views of Long Pond as we near the
shelter. 
Once
in camp, we find filtering water from the pond is a slow process –
there's no flow and filling the containers takes time. After that's
done, I head 0.3 miles back down the trail to the “beach” for a
swim. And so, of course, the sky opens up and drenches me until I
figure hey, I'm plenty chilled, I guess I don't need that swim after
all. Back to the lean-to.
At
some point today, my prized labyrinth medallion left me. I've been
wearing this pendant for three years and it has great sentimental
value.  When we left Bemis Mountain Lean-to this morning, it was
on its chain. By the end of the day, I was wearing only the chain –
the pendant was gone. I guess it decided it was time to move on. To
the person who finds it, I hope you take it with you on your next
journey.","Bemis Mountain Lean-to

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599885,"Today once again gives proof that “town days” are tough. In my mind, I’m already there – eating ice cream, doing the laundry, taking a nap. Whereas, in reality I’m still 8 miles from the road crossing and every tenth of a mile seem slower than the one before. Oh, mudholes, I do not love you. And I am still searching every marshy Pond for a moose, fruitlessly.  I do not know how something that can produce so much crap can remain completely invisible. 
It’s a cool, still morning as we leave Sabbathday Pond. We say our goodbyes to a southbound group consisting of a father and his college-age son and daughter. We have also been in step with two  northbound hikers and their dog for a number of days – it’s his fourth attempt to through hike the trail, and the first time he’s made it to Maine. Excitement radiates from him. Clearly, there’s no stopping him this time.... I am delighted for him, and just a little bit envious. 
Angela from the hostel comes to pick us up at the road crossing. We learn that she has hiked a huge section of the AT in winter – a tremendous accomplishment. My respect for her is off the charts. Now, with laundry done and showers taken, dad and I need to make some decisions. We have only two days of hiking time left before I will fly back to Minnesota for a high school reunion. We estimate that it will take us four days to hike from Maine Route 4 over Saddleback to the next road crossing. We also have to factor in that rain is expected, which may make surfaces treacherous, and the fact that we never, EVER hike faster than predicted. Over dinner, we decide that we’ll simply have to leave Saddleback for next time. It pains me very much to leave two days of potential hiking time on the table. Who knows if we will both be healthy and well enough to hike in 2019? We hope so, but we also know there are no guarantees. 
Next year will hopefully be our final trip, IF all goes according to plan (which it rarely does, but I keep making plans anyway).  We have 222 miles to go, having finished another 98 on this trip.  My dad and I have completed 1,969 miles of the A.T. to date. And we did so this year without injury. That’s clear success in our book.
For the last two days of our trip, we decide instead to explore the Maine coast and Pemaquid Point. Since neither dad nor I have ever been here, every two hours brings a new discovery. Lighthouses! Maritime museums! TNC preserves! Banded rock formations! Tidal bores! Archaeological digs! But everything is so disconcertingly easy. Like getting water, or staying clean. It seems inauthentic somehow....
The plan: to return to Rangeley next summer and finish the last 222 miles of the trail, perhaps with a bit of vehicular support. Just think, if we had decided to through hike the trail in 2008 we would’ve wrapped it all up 10 years ago. Instead, the adventure keeps unfurling itself into the future.","

The absolutely perfect hiking weather continued, and we had 360 degree views atop every mountain. We met Tina, who’s training for a 2020 thru-hike, and had the pleasure of staying in step with her for much of the day. On top of the Horn, we also met Breakless (thru in 2015), Kostas (who so kindly gave us his number, in case we need any help), and I Got Nothing. If the last one wasn’t actually his trail name, it should be. 


When we’re back in the woods, which happens between every peak, I see a lot of bunchberry and blue-bead lily plants anchoring the moss. We’re into berry season, and the blueberries atop Saddleback are delicious.... and distracting...


Poplar Ridge Shelter is full of NOBOs (northbounders) who are jazzed about being so close to Katahdin, and many are making their camping reservations. That’s something I need to do soon myself. We’ll have to pick a summit date and make it work.

Weather continues to be beautiful- low humidity, with highs in the mid-70s and lows at night in the 50s. Heard a hermit thrush singing this morning - one of my favorite birdsongs. We had our first stream to ford (Orbeton), but the rocks were positioned so that we didn’t have to get our feet wet. A few early asters are blooming, as well as some heal-all in wet places. 


When we started our climb up Lone Mountain, I distracted myself from the ascent by going through one of my favorite movies, scene by scene. This tactic works wonders for me - although eventually, I wear out the first movie and have to come up with another. The legs are wobbly today from all of the climbing, and I do best if I am not thinking about it. 


At the shelter we meet Tina one last time. She has to keep moving to meet her ride tonight, five miles ahead at the next road crossing. Thanks to her, we get advance notice that this shelter is full of mice. One dropped right on her as she was sitting under the overhang. Then it fell/crawled into her pack and she had to get it out somehow. Looking up into the rafters, I can see they are crammed with nesting material.

You’d think you wouldn’t sleep well on a one-inch thick mat on the ground, in a shelter with paper-thin walls. But after waking up briefly at 10, I am sound asleep until the alarm goes off at five something. 


We are keeping to a very successful eating schedule, with breakfast bars as soon as we get up, and snack breaks every hour and a half until we get to our destination. So, just as in Lord of the Rings, we have breakfast, Second breakfast, elevensies, lunch, afternoon tea, and supper. At least. We are drinking water on a similar schedule. If I’m hiking along and getting cranky, or having loopy thoughts, my first action is to take a drink of water. I’m usually dehydrated.


We take one of our breaks at the spot where the final section of the AT was completed in the 1930s. It’s amazing to think what it must’ve taken the CCC to build trail back then. Although it probably isn’t much different these days.... hand tools and physical labor. The MATC trail maintainers have done fantastic work on the trail and we appreciate it. 


We had some excellent views from the ridges today. We could see the vegetation line on the neighboring mountains, like a dark cap where deciduous trees shift to firs and hemlocks at the higher elevations. 


In the afternoon we descended steeply off Sugarloaf Mountain in the hot sun, sometimes having to hand our trekking poles down to each other. We decided that the term “scree” comes from the sound you make when you slide down it. Tired and spent by the time we made camp.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

We start with a steep climb of South Crocker Mountain, down and up over North Crocker, and a long, 5-mile descent to the road. On the way, we come across the number 2,000 spelled out in birch branches on the ground. We can now call ourselves “two thousand milers” - we have officially passed that mark! “Only” 190 miles to go.


We pop out at 3:30 and call for our shuttle to town. At the parking lot, there’s a poster with a picture of a missing hiker, Dusty Pilgrim, who hasn’t made contact with his family in over a week. We have not seen him. It weighs on my mind as we drive into town.  


From the motel, Papa Smurf and Sawyer shuttle us back to our car at Route 4 outside of Rangeley (where we started). Thence begins the classic “mad rush” of a town day: change clothes, run to outfitter store before they close, take all the hiking clothes to the laundromat and get ‘em going. Then across the street for dinner, move clothes to dryer, eat while checking the weather for the next week. Headline news (on the TVs above the bar) is extremely depressing. How happy we are when we aren’t following it!


After driving back to the Stratton Motel, it’s time to dig in to our resupply bags from the car. These contain food and supplies for the next 5 days, which we planned and packed back home. Hopefully our mess doesn’t disturb our bunk mate, MadTree. A fast-moving NOBO (compared to us, at least), he’ll be at Katahdin long before we get there. The forecast is for rain to move in tomorrow or the next day. We’ll probably get some in our next section, the Bigelows.


As the day is winding down, I learn that the missing hiker was recently found passed away in his tent, possibly from a medical condition. My heart goes out to his loved ones. We are all out here pursuing a dream, but so much is beyond our control.

It’s a humid morning, and rain is predicted. We see quite a few toads, frogs, and a garter snake on our climb towards the Bigelow peaks. We always planned these next two days to be short, about 5 miles each, and we’re happy to stick to that plan with rain coming. Today is all about the climb and staging for going over the peaks tomorrow. There will be alpine sections above tree line, which should always be treated with care. We pass through a landscape of huge boulders broken off the mountainside, some house-sized and draped with moss.

One reward of getting up so early is the beautiful sunrise we see over East Carry Pond. The hiking is good, relatively flat for Maine.

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621451,"Leaving a nice hostel, with beds and warmth and food, for the sake of going hiking in the rain is a fairly dismal prospect. But that’s what we do today, after dad and Poet take a look at the stove and decide the problem was probably the fuel canister. We’ve bought a new one and hope that fixes the problem. To keep our spirits up as we’re  getting drenched, we note that as soon as we start walking the Wilderness starts to shrink. Now we have only 99 miles left. Every few miles I enjoy thinking about how we are a few miles closer to the end.  The hundred mile ends at Golden Road and after that there are only about 15 miles of trail left, including Katahdin.All the southbounders today talk about the river fords ahead of us – how deep they are, how to handle them, which ones are the toughest. We knew we’d have to cross some rivers in the Hundred Mile, but after a couple days of rain there’s a lot more water to deal with. Little Wilson Creek is not easy. Water is flowing fast, and it’s hard to find a place where the water is relatively calm. We go one at a time, boots on, bracing ourselves with both poles.  Big Wilson has flatter water, but it’s much wider. There are three fords today, and though it takes time, we get through them all without falling.The shelter tonight is almost within sight of some railroad tracks, and when the train comes through it is LOUD.

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621456,"Due to circumstances beyond our control, not an injury but rather a road closure on the Katahdin-Ironworks Road, we had to leave the trail for a resupply today. Lucky we have a spare day built in to the calendar.  Luckier still that a trail Angel (John from Ohio) happened to be dropping off other hikers out in the wilderness, and offered to drive us back out to meet our John, who couldn’t get to us on the usual road. We are in Greenville Junction tonight, and will go back out on the trail tomorrow. We’ve got about a quarter or a third of the Hundred Mile Wilderness behind us. Hoping for better weather! Had 3 1/2 days of rain up through last night and it was a whole lotta no fun.","Chairback Gap Lean-to

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621909,"John - our wonderful shuttle driver, friend and all-around support dude- gets us back on the trail at K-I rode by about nine. One of our first tasks is to ford a shallow stream near the Gulf Hagas trail, which we do, boots and socks and all. They’ll dry out. 
About midday, we see a couple of moose tracks on the trail that are very fresh - they’re over top of the hiker footprints on the path. For the next mile we hike silently and watch the trail on all sides, but still, no moose sighting. The only one we have seen on the AT was in Vermont in 2016.
Since today is really only a half day’s hike, we get into camp in early afternoon. This is wonderful, because I have some time to read the Brother Cadfael murder mystery I snagged out of the free book box at Shaw’s. A book is a wonderful luxury out here. Years ago, back in Virginia, we found a copy of Thunderball in a shelter and took it with us. Dad and I had custody battles over who got the book each night. We love being on the trail, but a book is a welcome release from the daily grind of rocks and roots.","Katahdin Ironworks road

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621912,"Nearly every shelter or lean-to has its own logbook where all the passing hikers can record their thoughts. I’ve come to expect a little bit of everything in these - the witty and the mundane, the profane and the sacred, the wildly artistic and the vulgar. The logbook at Logan Brook shelter is great fun – there’s a poem to Elusive Moose, and a funny fake  obituary of Sydney Tappan (of Sydney Tappan campsite fame).We are counting down the miles (71) and the days (9) now.  It’s also the second day in a row that we got to the shelter shortly before the afternoon rain began, which feels great. We went over four peaks today - Gulf Hagas, West peak, Hay Mountain and White Cap.  From here, the trail levels out substantially all the way to Katahdin.","Carl A. Newhall lean-to

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621916,"Could this be the most beautiful lean-to of this section hike? The Cooper Brook Shelter has a creek right in front of it and a waterfall directly upstream. The sound of rushing water is constantly in our ears. After our longest day so far this section, 11.7 miles, I dropped my pack in the shelter, splashed across the creek and lay in the sun on a large rock like a turtle. I also use the waning afternoon light to write a letter (on paper!) to my husband. This was a picture-perfect hiking day, with cool, beautiful weather and level trails.  The only thing that marred it at all was that a thumbtack speared its way through my flip-flop and into my heel in the darkness of the shelter floor. We are meeting John tomorrow for a food resupply at Jo-Mary road, but now we’re thinking a run to town for a tetanus shot would not be a bad idea...","Logan Brook lean-to

Treecycler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622090,"It’s The Day. Three of us are climbing: me, dad, and Renee, dad’s partner/SO. She flew in on Wednesday to join us for the final push to the top. 
Even on our last day, we have a first: our first time night-hiking! Katahdin is an extremely strenuous hike, 5.2 miles up to the summit and the same back (if we return via the same trail). The Baxter Park ranger said it is the longest sustained climb on the entire A.T. Because we are lucky to average one mile per hour on terrain like this, we hit the trail at 4:45 am, headlamps on. We hope to finish before sunset. Our turn-around time is 1 pm - if we aren’t at the top by then, we will descend no matter what.
The real work begins when we break out of the trees and start climbing steeply up a rocky ridge. This is where the first hikers catch us, around 8 am. Good going, Wander Women (three thru-hiker gals from CO)! It’s great to see them again. “Hiking“ doesn’t begin to describe what we’re doing at this point. I’m throwing my hiking poles up on to ledges and then levering myself up, wedging my way up cracks between boulders, and clinging to sharp rock ridges with toes and fingertips. It’s rock climbing, pure and simple. At a couple of points there are metal bars sunk into the rock for a handhold where there’s nothing else to grab. We have stunning views of The Owl (mountain) as the sun strikes its sheer rocky cliffs to our left.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: after this, I am no longer afraid of heights. That fear was a luxury- it gave me an “out.” But on the AT the only way to finish is to grit my teeth, don’t look down, and do it.

The grueling climb ends at The Tableland, a flatter, grassy alpine zone marked with rock cairns. 1.6 miles to go, Lots of hikers are flowing past us now. The forecast for up here today 55 degrees with winds at 10-15 mph, about as good as we can hope for. The summit is still shrouded in mist and clouds are funneling wildly up the mountainside, raking across the peak.



When I finally see the iconic sign marking the summit, I am brushing away tears. We reach the top at ten to eleven. I have to touch the sign for it to be real. And of course we take dozens of pictures- everyone who finishes has to have that final, triumphant image!
Euphoria and exhaustion. We share our moment with a couple dozen other thru-, section and day hikers. One thru-hiker captured it perfectly. Someone congratulated her as she stood 10 feet from the summit, waiting for her turn to take a picture, and she wryly said “Not there yet!” 


And even when we acknowledge that it IS over, and we’ve done it, our day is only half finished. We decide to descend by a different trail, the Abol Trail, which is steep and more gravelly than the one we came up (Hunt), but is shorter and has switchbacks. It’s the right decision. We have to do a lot of “arm work,” lowering ourselves down off boulders, and the knees are very unhappy by the end. But we get down to Abol Campground by 4:30. What a wonderful, difficult, long-awaited day!!","Katahdin Stream Campground
