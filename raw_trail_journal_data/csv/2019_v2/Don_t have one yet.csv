Don't have one yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608131,"Today we started out in the drip. This is basically walking in a cloud. We had big plans for this day and in the end the plans were good. We wanted to get to Franklin NC to resupply, rest and take a zero day(no miles).  We hiked to Deep Gap and got on the Kimsey Creek trail to get to our pickup point. Notice not the AT. Extra hiking!  KCT was basically Kimsey Creek with all the rain. It was also rated easiest.  NC has a weird rating system. Anyway we only got a little lost and a little wet and we had to move like heck to make our pickup time. Very, very pretty though. At rendezvous point our ride is missing. No cell service.  We decided we might have to walk out further. After much screaming (no bear would dare to come near)we decided which way to walk. After another mile ride came. Were we happy! Into Franklin but our reservation got screwed up but we found a place. We are happy hikers!  Tomorrow we hike on.","Muskrat Creek Shelter
