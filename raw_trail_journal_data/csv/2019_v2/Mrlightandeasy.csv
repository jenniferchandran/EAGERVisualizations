Mrlightandeasy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615040,"Hitting the trail at 7AMHeading North through NJ.. I have no idea how many miles I can do in a day or where I will get too … I don't want my days to be about that … I want it to be about enjoying the time and the sights, while taking a walk.The weather lately has been a little volatile, to say the least, here in New Jersey so it should be interesting. Staying dry will be a prioritySo it goes","Delaware Water Gap NJ heading North

Mrlightandeasy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615101,"day 1 in the books... I have set up camp and will be eating chicken teriyaki soon.
Beacause of all the rain over the past days I felt like the first three miles I was hiking alongside Appalachian Stream.  Today was just magnificent I sat for a bit and looked over the Delaware river then later had a forever view of NJ farmlands and forests.  My body protested a lot bit I just took it slow and easy and made a good distance I think
I have set up camp just north of Millbrook-Blairstown road.  There is a spring here called Rattlesnake Spring so a good place to stop.
So it goes","Route 80 Delaware water gap

Mrlightandeasy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615270,"had a thunderstorm pass through last night, so the result was I was up early.  Hit the trail at 6 am and did about 3 miles to Route 206 on Kittatiny Lake.  There is a place here called Mountain House Tavern ...allegedly they open at 11:30 and I am in the mood for a burger.
As I sit here and look over the lake and ponder more rain coming in this afternoon, my sore calves and tired body ...I think I am going to hang out for the rest of the day... I need to recouperate 
So it goes","

Mrlightandeasy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615376,"Today was a perfect day to be out for a walk.. sunny, not to warm nice breeze...NJ is beautiful BTWAnyway back to yesterday ... I hit a wall, I saw that 3 miles down the mountain was a deli .. so of course I walked toward the bacon, egg, and cheese on a whole wheat bagel perhaps some chips and an OJ.... deli was closed out of business that did me in.  So I waited until 11:30 and went to Mountain House Tavern for a scotch and a grilled chicken sandwich.  Then I rested up until I hit the trail at 8 am today... I actually had good home cooked food.. thanks mom!!!Today I was just simply walking for the most part the trail was easy... so to speak... a lot of nice sights which I took time to take in. I am at the Rutherford shelter one other woman here that is it so far.  Tent pitched and having dinner So it goes","206 Culver’s gap

Mrlightandeasy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615452,"last night killed me, it dipped into the 30s here in the NJ highlands.  I was not ready for that in June ... top it off with a loud bird that sounded like a car alarm deciding to stay up late night.  I had checked my watch three times by midnight to see if it was almost dawn.
I was in the trail at 5:30 could not wait to get moving.  But my body was sore, cold I felt like I had a hangover... I was not walking safely so I called to be extracted at route 23 high point.  Thank you Mellissa and Charlotte for getting me.
As of now I think I am done...Mellissa said it best once you come out it is tough to go back.
50 miles in 5 days not to bad, loved it outside just need to improve a few things with equipment and plan... and get in shape for the next time I just want to take a walk
Who knows after a good night sleep I may get back out ....","Rutherford Shelter
