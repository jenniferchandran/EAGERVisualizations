Overwatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579913,"Dropped off this morning about 0900 with my hiking partner "" Yellow Jacket"". Temp was cool in the 40's. As soon as we started walking, we were chased down by a man and his daughter asking if we wanted to come back down to the gap for breakfast. Massive Trail magic setup. We politely declined. They gave us some fruit and off we went. The hike was comfortable with the temps. Foggy most of the day. No view from Ramrock Mountain. Passed thru Woody Gap and another group set up with trail magic breakfast. Interacted with many great Thru hikers. Counting down the days till February 2018. Stopped at Lance creek for water and continued on to Woods Hole Shelter. Nobody there upon arrival. One hiker showed up a few hours after we arrived. Great day.",,Woods Hole Shelter,"Mar 25, Sat",10.80
Overwatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579914,"We had great intentions to go to Whitley Gap Shelter. Departed about 0730. No views again. Fog as far as we could see. About 20 feet. While at the shelter last night, about midnight we heard a couple of gunshots of in the distance. Then, all of a sudden, there was automatic rifle/ machine gun fire. Yellow Jacket and I figured out, the Ranger Students were out on patrol conducting a mission. Got to thinking of when I attended Ranger school back in the 80's, so long ago but some great miserable times with great people. RLTW. Back to the present. We got to Neels Gap and Mountain Crossings. Grabbed a burger and coke. Yellow Jacket had never experienced a Hostel, we decided to stay, it was going to rain tonight so we got a bunk, talked to other hikers and again, another Church set up trail magic outside of the Hostel. Short but great day",,Mountain Grossings,"Mar 26, Sun",4
Overwatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579915,"Got up and headed out about 0800. Last night a handful of thru hikers came into the Hostel. It was amazing watching the thru hikers going through their packs and literally throwing items into the hikers box. Stoves, tents, clothes and even extra boots. One hiker had a gallon bag of fish oil capsules. During the night, additional hikers came in And were spread out in the common area. Immediat climb out of Mountain Crossings. No rain today but still low lying fog. By the time we arrived to Levelland Mountain visibility had increased to about 2 miles or so. A little bit of a view. A lot of UH60 Blackhawk flyovers in the area today. Warmed up today to I would say was in the mid 50's. Great walking temps. We got to the Whitley Gap trail mid afternoon and started the downhill descent. When we got to the shelter there was a female hiker there. When she saw us she was so excited and said she was saved. She was limping with on boot on and an ace wrap on her other foot. Four other hikers arrived over the next hour. Then, a young hiker arrived with very minimal gear. We will call him Critter. Outfitted in combat boots, fatigues, a shoulder roll and a Hugh hiking staff with feathers, burlap and what I call a Rambo knife. He only ate and then continued on. Later in the night, it started storming and the young lady that was there when we arrived was out of the shelter when lightning struck bout 200 meters away. She came flying back into the shelter so fast. Really scared her, but we all got her calmed down. Long sleepless night. But we survived.",,Whitley Gap Shelter,"Mar 27, Mon",8
Overwatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579916,"Today was a great day of hiking. We caught a large bubble of hikers today. Couple of young brother/ sister groups with dogs. Just a great day to hike. Warm but not hot. Long stretch here we just walked below the ridge line nice a easy terrain for most part. We got to the shelter late afternoon and it was packed with hikers. Tents everywhere, shelter was full. Got a little irritated about a half mile from the shelter, the water source there had day hikers soaking there feet and letting there dog walk in the water. Oh well, bit my tongue and kept walking. I met a couple of thru hikers with some awesome stories. Reset on the AT, if your reading this, you and your son are the men. Got a fire going tonight and just talked with everyone, again, can't wait until February 2018.",,Blue Mountain Shelter,"Mar 28, Tue",13
Overwatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583911,"Good morning all. 1 week out from my start. As most of you hikers know, it's a week of final preparations, though i(we) know is just being anxious to get started. As many times as I have sectioned hiked the AT, it still brings an an indescribable excitement of hiking this trail in prep for a 2019 thruhike. For all of the hikers out there now, this year has really been rough on them. This time last year, Yellow Jacket and I did the section to Unicoi Gap and met some awesome people. Weather was shorts and shirts with only a day or two of rain. I am ready to get started on this prep hike and enjoy the good and bad times. I will definatly miss my family and friends, but they will be walking with me in spirit. Time to go and finish those little tasks before I leave. Later. Already sounds like I'm doing my thruhike.",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Sun",0

The views today were unbelievable, partly cloudy skies and no rain in the area around Amicalola.We then went and checked in to the lodge and Brenda and Anna stayed and had dinner with me this evening. I’m sitting in my room right now looking at my gear doing a final check getting ready for the approach trail tomorrow morning. Approximately 9 miles to the top of Springer Mountain. Once I get up there I’ll take a few pictures Then continue on a few more miles until I find a suitable place to stay for the evening.

IAbout three hours into the walk beautiful so far kind of good views from the mountain tops still a lot of trees but no leaves so you can see off in the distance pretty well.  Definitely don’t have my trail legs yet. Not a problem because I’m working on it, so my walk continues.

Overwatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584970,"Day2. March 19. Getting ready to start walking for the day. Rained all night with a few lightning strikes. Raining now with lightning and thunder. Waiting a few minutes till we go. Met a father and son team doing a thru hike. Son is moving ahead a few miles at a time dropping his pack then coming back to get his dads. His dad is walking when his son gets back to him. More to follow. Stopped at long creek falls for a snack and to get a picture and short video. When I left the falls, it started to rain harder. Just as I got to the top of Hawk mountain it started thundering and lightning. When I got to the Hawk mountain camp sites it started hailing. I decided to head to the Hawk mountain Shelter.  Got here just in time to watch the last Shelter spot fill up. The trail Shelter is a 3 sided structure that are set about a days worth of hiking along the entire length of the trail.  Though I’ll mostly be in a tent, if space is available, I’ll use the Shelter in really bad weather, like today and tomorrow. Tented it tonight.  Hawk Mountain Shelter Miles today 5.3 miles.","Stover Creek Shelter

Overwatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584971,"Day 3 March 20. Pretty miserable night. Stayed at Hawk Mountain shelter. Didn’t get there in time to get a spot in the shelter. Set up tent in between rain storms. Woke up last night to lightning and wind that sounded like a train coming thru the trees. Rain seemed like it came in sideways. Most people woke up this morning with nothing dry, clothes, tents, etc. it wasn’t that we didn’t set them up properly, the wind and rain pulled a lot of the tent stakes out of the ground. Ridge runner recommended we dry things out and stay put for the next storm coming in. We did. No mileage today. Later. A hiker came into the Shelter trail name Biscuit has hiked the trail twice and I’d doing his third thru hike. Talking to us about food recipes. Tune with olive oil, packet of mayonnaise and relish, a boiled egg, oil and vinegar-chips in a burrito wrap.  Going to try this later. Glad we stayed.  Half the shelter emptied out.  Got a spot in  it and hung gear out to dry.  No miles today",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Tue",0
Overwatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584972,Day 4. March 21.  Woke up to ice and snow. We started moving toward Gooch Mountain Shelter and ran into a parks services ranger. He said that he would recommend heading into town to get dried out and wait out the weather for that night. We got done to Horse Gap and there were a few shuttle drivers waiting to take hikers in if wanted. We took a shuttle to the Holiday Inn in Dahlonega. We got into town walked a couple of miles to Walmart to get a few more days of resupplies. Dried all my gear out and slept good.,,Horse Gap,"Mar 21, Wed",2.40
Overwatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597434,"Been a while since I have been on.  I took a tumble back in March near standing Indian Mountain.  Slipped on some wet rocks and literally face planted.  During the fall I thought I just tweaked my back.  Moving was very slow going at this point.  Pain down left leg, weakness in left leg, could barely bend. Turned around and hobbled my way back to Deep Gap.  Got a ride into town.  Long story short, Herniated lumbar disks 2-5 and S1.  Recovering now and slowly strengthening my back again.  Everybody asks what my pack load was and it was around 25 lbs.  I had just resupplied the day before at Top of Georgia.  So Doc has said no to hiking the rest of this year.  Planning on physical therapy and conditioning to go for a thru hike net year.  Though I have sectioned up to Standing Indian Mountain, I will again start at springer when I do.  Going to upload a few pics so you can see what this mug looked like.  Later.","

Overwatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607430,"Good evening all.  12 days until I start.  Finishing my last 2 days of work at my current assignment.  Great group of people here.  If they read this they know who they are.  They have been asking when I am coming back or if I am coming back.. No plans at this time, but, I am a contract type worker, so who know, I could end up back there on a future assignment.  But now, just focusing on the upcoming hike.  I will only have a week with my beautiful wife and daughter before they drive me to Georgia and drop me off.  I will be walking until mid May or so then I will have to leave the trail for about 6- 8 weeks.  I promised the Salvation Army leaders I did some work for last year that I would come back this summer and work with them again.  So this hike may turn into a flip.  Just have to see.  The hard part now id finalizing my packing list.  Specifically my pack..  I have three to choose from.  HMG 3400 Winf Rider, Osprey Atmos 65, and an Arcteryx Bora 63.  I know the last two packs are the heavier of the three, but the comfort of them cant be beat.  Decisions, decisions.  With the heavier of the packs my pack with 4 days of food is 27 lbs.  With the HMG its 24.5 lbs.  Comfort will be my deciding factor.  Well, time to close and hit the rack.  Another long day tomorrow.",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Wed",0
