Cliff Hanger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582528,I attended a Back Packing class at a local outdoor outfitter. I told myself to attend as many seminars as I could not matter how much I think I know I can always learn something new. I am glad I did as there was indeed something new I learned. I learned a new way (for me) how to simply hang your food bag with having to tie off the end to a tree. I also learned that if I am not careful I am going to completely psyche myself out as I don't think you can ever be fully prepared. Every hike is different and you will always wish you had something different or did something different. Just take that first step.....,,View Entry,"Jan 27, Sat",0
Cliff Hanger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582467,Every new journey begins with one small step. I look forward to taking my first step onto the trail.,,View Entry,"Jan 28, Sun",0
Cliff Hanger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582529,"I have decided that walking is my best form of training at this time. Living in Florida there aren't too many hills and mountains but there are plenty of opportunities to just walk. So....I walk. I feel like Forrest Gump. I am starting with just mileage and no pack then I will add the pack and later I will add the weight and walk some more. I have some training hikes planned but you have to keep training in between. As an athlete we trained daily for that match or race or marathon. I am thinking training for the Appalachian Trail is no different. I am trying to train daily, one step at a a time.",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Mon",0
Cliff Hanger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583388,"As I train for the AT which includes a lot of walking, walking and more walking. I average about 8 miles on my walks give or take without carrying any weight. I will add weight and distance in time with one of my goals walking from my apartment to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium which is about 15 miles. (This is where I use to work and I loved talking about their important mission of Rescue, rehabilitation and Release of hurt marine life.) During todays Training walk it occurred to me I am learning some important lessons that just might apply to life's journey and certainly will apply to the AT. Enjoy and feel free to add to the list your own life's lessons.
* It's not about a race, it's about the pace.
* When you feel strong pick up the pace.
* When you don't feel strong slow down the pace.
* Sometimes you just need to change shoes.
* Feeling tired - take a break.
* Carrying too much weight? Lighten the load.
* Not carrying enough weight? Enjoy the moment.
* Say hello to those you pass as you may need their smile.
* Sometimes you need to shorten the stride and thats ok.
* Its ok to look down as you walk...you might find money.
* Unplug...there is music everywhere.
* Feels like forever? One step at a time....
* Scared, apprehensive? ""Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet."" This too shall pass....",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Tue",0
