Sawdust,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601803,I have been walking 4 to 5 times a week for the past 6 months.  Each walk is 5 to 10 miles.  In June my crew and I hiked 58 miles in Virginia.  We started at Four Pines hostel and finished at Middle Creek Campground.  The crew has been hiking about 100 miles per year on the AT.  The future of our crew will change due to the untimely death of Reed Miller.  Reed died suddenly two weeks after our hike.  It has been said that Reed was glue that held our group together.  I will write more on Reed in later journals.  ,,View Entry,"Aug 30, Thu",0

Sawdust,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602200,A short day. Georgia does not make it easy.  The Labor Day section hikers are gone and the trail keeps fighting each mile.  I have met a lot of through hikers over the years on section hikes with my crew.  I learn a lot from each and every one of them.  I have asked all of them what part of the trail was the toughest.  Most hikers say hands down Georgia.  Of course they have not been to the Whites yet,"Neel’s Gap

Sawdust,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602511,"Day 6 met some section hikers from Florida today.  They were a great group of friends that hit the trail every year for a few days of fun and adventure.  Much like the crew I hike with.  I met them at the shelter.  At the shelter last night we encountered a lot of mice. Not an uncommon occurrence.  Usually the hikers just have to ride out the night with the mice chewing on our gear, food and running across our faces.  But a tip I learned from a hiker on trail journals is to fight back and carry a mouse trap.  Just like people usually one or two in the crowd cause most of the trouble.  After taking out four mice in the first hour or so we slept well the rest of the night.  Oh the life of a hiker.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Sawdust,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602516,Day 7 after saying goodbye to my shelter mates.  I saw a nice black bear about a mile south of the shelter.  I think he was turning over rocks on the trail to eat grubs.  I saw him just before he saw me and he quickly ran off.  Too fast for a picture.  Later in the day I heard a rattle snake on the trail just before I saw him.  He was a large Cainbrake or commonly known as a Timber rattler.  He was about six feet long and very thick.  Most snakes will get out of the way and avoid human contact.  This one was very stubborn.  I first tried to run him off with some rocks.  That just made him mad. Then I tried to push him off the trail with my walking poles. Yeah that made him madder.  He struck at me several times.  At that point I yielded the trail to him and walked in the brush around him.  I ended up at Top Of Georgia Hostel.  I will do a zero here tomorrow and rest.,"Tray Mountain Shelter

I hiked over Standing Indian Mountain.  Several signs indicated that the trail was in a bear sanctuary?  Not the best place to spend the night.  The trail went through an area of fire damage.  The area is recovering.  I made it to Carter Gap Shelter.  I had the shelter to myself again.  The weather is still pretty hot and humid for September.  A nice view from the Shelter.,"Deep Gap

Sawdust,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609261,"October 9,2018. I was dropped off at winding Stairs by my lovely wife in a cold rain. I put on my pack under the cover of our vans lift gate to stay dry. It was a nice hike to Wayah Bald. The top was fogged in. No view but you could see the damage from the wildlife two years ago. The trail was not marked very well. I used Guthook to stay on the trail. I am not a high tech guy but Guthook is a priceless tool on the trail. Darkness caught me just past the tower. I used my headlight the last mile to the shelter.  About 1/4 mile before the shelter a pack of coyotes started howling to my left. They sounded about 100 yards away. When I arrived at the shelter I met Reed Aiken. He is from Virginia and I would spend the next two days with him. I set up my sleeping pad and bag before filling my water bladder for the next two meals.  Reed and I discussed mice in the shelter. (A normal conversation for hikers). We did not notice much mice activity. I set my mouse trap just in case.  While I was bating my trap with a raisin and mouse jumped into my ziplock bag full of raisins.  It was no use to try and hit him my raisins were ruined and mice are just too fast. Before we went to sleep we harvested 7 mice.","Winding Stair Gap

Sawdust,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609266,Reed and I slept pretty well. We planned to hike the 16 miles to the Nantahala Outdoor center to stay in the Hostel due to the amount of rain expected from the hurricane passing through today. It was a no frills day of hiking trying to make the Hostel before dark. The days are getting shorter so it was hard hiking. I hiked the last hour by headlight.  Reed and I kept in touch and both of us did not think to call ahead about room in the Hostel. When we arrived the office was closed and we were out of luck. Reed was able to contact Nantahala Log Cabin Lodge. Cindy provided a ride the mile and a half to an from the lodge.  Reed a I split the room. A nice room at a great price.,"Wayah Bald Shelter

I stopped at Sassafras Gap Shelter. The shelter was crowded so I tent camped.  The next morning a light snow covered the ground. Our water was not frozen solid but did have ice.    One of the toughest things about this hike is keeping this journal. The site is difficult to use and takes a lot of time, effort.  I have hiked two more weeks but documenting it on this website is almost impossible for a normal non computer person on a smart phone.","Nantahala Outdoor center
