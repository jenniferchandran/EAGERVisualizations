Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582596,"Moving right along, this is the second of 3 required entries.Many details have been worked out. Travel plans finalized, hotel reserved, money budgeted, to name only a few. As I have been actively backpacking for 47 years I thought I would not have much gear to buy. Over the last 5 years a lot of my stuff started wearing out. When replacing gear it was with a mind for my through hike. I only have 1 or 2 more things to get and those should be done in the next couple of days.Tomorrow I take over the spare bedroom as my packing room. This should give me room to lay out all my gear and change, swap out things.",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Wed",0

In January a good friend and I drove from our homes in upstate New York to Harpers Ferry, only a 4 1/2 hour drive one way. The weather and company were good and it was a very good day trip. At AMC headquarters I was able to get everything done I wanted to. Membership in AMC, check, register my thru hike, check, talk to and get intel from headquarters staff, check. I can't say enough about the people at AMC headquarters, very friendly with tons of knowledge and experience. Also with a good deal of patience as they answered all of my questions, questions I'm sure they have been asked over and over. I did also buy one last book off their shelf, ""Thru"". This turned out to be a good read about a fictional group of thru hikers dealing with group dynamics and the challenges of the trail.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Thu",0
Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582639,"I have for a long time had the plan of not taking a stove and eating cold meals. Some weekend trips were used to test this and it went very well. But this morning I'm sitting in my nice warm house while outside the wind chill is below zero. My next thought was that early on for my hike a warm, if not hot, meal at the end of the day would be a morale booster. So I started playing with the small alcohol stove that is pictured. It weighs next to nothing, burns for 30 minutes when full and boils 2 cups of ice cold water in less than 15 minutes. I still need to play with this some more, but this just might make the cut. After I get out of the cold weather it would be sent home.",,View Entry,"Feb 02, Fri",0
Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582732,"For the last couple of months anyone who comes anywhere near me has gotten an ear full about my thru hike. In return the number one question I get asked is ""why are you doing this"". This becomes a very personal question as there are as many reasons why as there are thru hikers.For me, there are several reasons and these are not in any order of importance. I have wanted to do this hike since I was 18, a long time to have a goal. It is the ultimate challenge for what I love to do. To be an inspiration for my grandkids, to take on the hard and difficult challenges no matter how daunting they are. One last reason, I do not want to be sitting on my porch years from now in a rocking chair and ask my self ""I wonder if I could have hiked the AT, if only I had tried"". I would rather try and fail than to have never tried. If I fail, it would be disappointing but I would be OK with it knowing that I gave it my best effort. Having written this, it is the only time I will entertain a defeatist attitude going forward.There are probably other reasons that I will discover later, but for now I hope that at least one of the above will get me thru the hard days that I know are coming.",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Wed",0
Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583330,"To say that I'm getting excited does not even begin to describe it. I knew I was getting close to my start date, but when I looked at the calendar I found that I was 28 days till start. Holy cow, that is really soon. I need to knuckle down and get some of the detail planning done for the first 2 weeks of this journey. The plan is to have only a few drop boxes sent to me and they need to be finalized. Most of my supplies I will pick up in towns along the way. When in a town I can also get a couple of good meals under my belt and if needed stay in a hostel/motel when worn out. Can't wait till I can eat like a teenager again and still loose weight. Since last July I have lost 26 lbs. thanks to Weight Watchers. That's 26 fewer lbs. that I need to drag on the trail.
Travel plans:
Spend a few days at Raleigh, NC with our son and his family.
3/23 - day hike the approach trail, 8.8 miles up and 8.8 miles down ""CURRAHEE"" (homage to Band of Brothers).
3/25 - boots on Springer and start my hike.
Guess I had better get back to my planning table. It is said that no rain no pain, no Maine. Without planning, no Georgia.",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Sun",0
Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583492,"This morning I thought that I would go back over to where I used to work. The goal was to share information about this journal with a woman that I had the good fortune to work with. She in turn sent emails to everyone else in the department with the internet link. As I started to walk down the hall to leave, and visiting with people, past coworkers started coming up to me saying that they had just read the journal. I received many words of encouragement and wishes of good luck. This left me completely pumped up and wishing I could start hiking now. It was a great visit. I now have a whole new group of people following my journal and cheering me on. When hiking the AT you can't have too many cheerleaders.",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Thu",0
Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583843,"Back on Feb. 2nd I put out an entry about an alcohol stove that I was trying and might take on the hike. Well, after cooking 3 or 4 meals on it I can definitely say this stove will never see the AT. It took 15 - 30 minutes just to get the thing to put out flames from all the tiny holes. That is more messing around than I want after a long cold day of hiking. After listening to me whining about this for the umpteenth time, Mrs. Bampa got me a Pocketrocket 2 for my birthday. Wow what a difference, lights with the touch of a match and instantly puts out a blue flame to cook with. The fuel cartridge should be readably available on the AT. The only draw back I can see is the need to carry the empty fuel cartridge till I can toss my garbage. Looking forward to hot meals on cold nights at the start and end of this journey. Once out of the cold weather it will be sent home.",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Fri",0

Went through the visitor center, including the ever present gift shop. Attended a thru hiker orientation and got some good intel on trail conditions.
Today's activity was a day hike of the approach trail to Springer Mtn. 8.8 miles up and 8.8 miles down, CURRAHEE. This turned into a very long day, even met a colorful hiking character.Tonight Bear and his family will arrive. Team Bampa will be together again.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Fri",0

After a wild drive up the forest service road Team Bampa arrived in the parking area 1 mile from the start of the trail. The plan was for everyone to walk with me to the start, but the grandkids gave up about 3/4 of the way in. We said our goodbyes in the middle of the trail. This was both sad and exciting, I stood there for some time as they walked away until they were out of sight. After they were gone I just stood there praying I have earned the right to have such a wonderful and supportive family. Then I continued on alone. 
After signing the trail register and taking picture, I was off on the start of this adventure. The mountains in Georgia are no joke, they are mountains. It took until 4:30 to get to Hawk Mountain Campground. Met a lot of other hikers all heading the same direction and stopping at the same camping area. The weather was cold and overcast, walking most of the day in clouds. After getting my tent set up, supper cooked, food secured for the night and collecting and purifying water, it was off to my sleeping bag at 7:15. Boy did it get cold during the night but made out well with the clothes I brought for at night.",,Hawk Mountain Campground,"Mar 25, Sun",0
Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584990,"The wind roared all night but did not bother anyone's tents as we were down in a steep valley. Some of the campers that were using hammocks complained about rocking all night. As I was hiking out I noticed that most tents were quite. Everybody must have been sleeping in from the first day on the trail. The weather today started out sunny but became overcast and cold. Another day without views. The big climb for today was Sassafras Mountain and then Justus Mountain. Finding water has not been any problem as all the streams and springs are flowing. When we got to Gooch Mountain Shelter the place is full of hikers. The shelter that holds 14 and is full and all 12 tent pads are taken. Many tent pads have 2 tents on them now and some tents set up were there is not any hint of a flat spot. Tonight I managed to get a call out to Mrs. Bampa, boy do I miss her and the rest of the family. Just now there are 2 owls calling back and forth.
I see it is about 8 and this is pretty much hiker midnight. Guess I'll end this and get some sleep. Feels like another cold night.",,Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Mar 26, Mon",0
Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585230,"A good day of hiking, a little warmer than yesterday but still in cloud cover when we get up high. Lots of people here at Lance Creek, tents set up end to end. Such is life in the hiker bubble. Hike and camp with the same people each day. This will change once we get to Neel Gap tomorrow as some only planned to go that far. Also, on the average 25 percent of the hikers who quit will end their hike at Neel Gap.
When I was getting ready to go the creek to filter water for supper and tomorrow there was a big problem. The ATC had posted that the water contained faecal matter. They also said that if you filter and boil/chemically treat you should be OK. The only stuff I want in my Ramen noodles is what I put in it. I checked the water I had left from today and found that I had enough for my meal and for tomorrow until I get to a spring. The reason for this problem is that to many people have camped here without being careful with their waist. Tomorrow will be another day with it's own challenges.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Today's hiking was all up hill with a number of PUD's (pointless ups and downs) and the climb up to the top of Blood Mtn. at 4457 feet. I made good time as my legs do better each day and got to the top a little after 12:00. From the top it is 2.4 miles to Neel Gap where I have a food resupply box that I sent and I hope to be able to stay at Mountain Crossings.",,Neel Gap,"Mar 28, Wed",0
Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585275,"About 15 minutes after the previous picture was taken and while hiking down to Neel Gap I fell. Slid 15 feet on my butt with pack on. Left boot heal hit a rock which stopped my boot and foot. Problem is the rest of me continued forward. The end result was a foot at an angle with a lot of pain. When I was able to stand the ankle would not support my weight. Mike, another thru hiker with me got a cell signal and called 911. It would take the first rescuers an hour to reach me. Given the remoteness and difficulty of Blood Mtn I thought this was really fast. Eventually a team of 8 rescuers were needed to evacuate me down the Mtn. They worked extremely hard to carry me in a stokes basket down to Neel Gap and a waiting ambulance. A quick ride to Union General Hospital where x-rays showed nothing broken but the ankle was badly sprained. After it was taped up I was ready to be released. After the fall I was able to call Mrs. Bampa and that set in place a remarkable family effort. My brother in law made the 2 1/2 hr drive from Ashville, NC and got to the hospital just as I was released. We then went back to Ashville where son Bear, who drove 4 hrs from Raleigh NC, met us, he and I stayed the night in a hotel. The next day Bear and I drove to Raleigh to his home were I am now. I will stay here for several days for the swelling to go down, then I will drive myself back home to upstate New York.
This is enough for one journal entry. In a few days, after I have had time to sort things out, I will post a follow-up. But, I'm pretty sure my thru hike is over for this year.",,View Entry,"Mar 28, Wed",0

Does not hurt as much, swelling is down and I can put a little weight on it. I plan to head for home tomorrow, Easter. I had hoped to go home today so as to be there for Easter but that did not work out. Of course the Grandkids want me to stay but I need to see Mrs. Bampa.
Still sorting out the emotions of loosing this trip, but already thinking about 2019. A day or two after I get home I will put out an entry with future plans.",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Sat",0

First to the Union County Vol Fire and Rescue. The 8 people needed to get me off Blood Mtn. did an absolutely great job in getting me down. Next, Union General Hospital ER Dept. I was there less than 2 hrs during which X-rays were taken, evaluated by a doctor, ankle taped and even a meal.Next to my brother in law and son Bear who drove during the night to relay me from the hospital to Asheville, NC and then on to Raleigh, NC where I stayed with our son and his family for 3 days. He and Sarah Bear did everything  possible to make me comfortable. And it is always good to be with the Grandkids.

Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585725,"Yesterday I had an appointment with my doctor. She confirmed that the ankle is moderately to severally sprained and will take 8-12 weeks to heal. This definitely ends my thru hike for this year. Yes, I could start over at Blood Mtn, hike to Harper's Ferry and then get transportation to Maine and hike back south. This is called a flip-flop and does qualify as a through hike. But, this is not my hike. I have always wanted to start at Springer and go all the way to Katahdin in one shot. With that in mind I'm now looking at March 25, 2019 as a new start date. I will return to the AT wiser and stronger.

Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595186,"Today part of Team Bampa did trail magic. Bella Bear, Bear (pictured above) and Bampa setup the magic at mile1139 where the trail crosses PA route 850. What great fun it was to hand out chilli, bananas, oranges, watermelon, brownies, cookies, soda and water. Had 14 thru hikers and 2 section hikers stop. All agreed that Rhonda cookies are top notch. We even had chairs for all to sit in and take a break. It was a good time listening to all their stories and they in turn listening to our story. 
I only wish the AT was closer to my home as it was a 3 hr drive, that way we could do this more often. I had planned to do trail magic next year after my hike, but, my hike this year was cut short.
Please note: that in the next week I will be zeroing out my milage hiked and making other changes to this journal to get ready for a thru hike in 2019. It is my intention to post next year's hike in this same journal.",,View Entry,"Jun 21, Thu",0

Spent the summer training up for the AT. Walking every other day and riding bike the next day. But, there have been a couple bumps in the road. The first thing that happened was a case of shingles. Trust me, you do not want to have this, get the shot and prevent it. The next thing that happened was I hurt my back. Now I'm back on track walking every day I can for at least 3 hours with hills tossed in for good measure. I also get out on trails for the day when I can. Being in upstate New York winter has arrived with cold temps and snow, I make  the best of it and still get out. This should put me in better shape for my start in 2019 than I was in this year.

Final preparations are going smoothly, with 10 days out from my start they better be going smoothly. Food drier has been running steadily putting out fruit and jerky. Food to start with has been bought and broken down into pouches for each day. Even mailed out a food box for pickup on day 4. Today's tasks were to finalize a 7 day menu for Smoky Mountain National Park along with a shopping list as this will be mailed to me. Also today, all of my outer clothing, tent and hiking boots were hosed down with Permethrin to deal with ticks. It might seem early to be concerned with the blood suckers, but AT headquarters at Harper's Ferry said that you can run into hostile ticks anytime of the year.Team Bampa is firmly in place, words of encouragement and prayers from family, friends and neighbors have been sent my way.

Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609456,"Over the last 2 weeks I have had many conversations about my thru hike. The biggest thing I take away from this is that most people don't know a lot about the trail. So here are some facts for the casual reader of my journal.
The AT this year is 2,192 miles long. Each year the distance changes due to reroutes.
The trail goes thru 14 states. Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
It takes 4 - 6 months to complete. Some hikers will do it faster and others will take longer. Yet other thru hikers will take years to complete a thru hike as they do sections of the trail as their schedules allow. ""Hike your own hike"", (HYOH).
A hiker will take about 5 million steps. This does not include days spent in towns doing resupply or walking from the trail to town and back.
A person who completes a thru will have gone thru the same change in elevation as having climbed Mt. Everest, 14 times.
There are many other facts about the trail. You can find these by reading my journal, other journals of hikers or check out a book about the trail. There's only a couple hundred to choose from.",,View Entry,"Apr 03, Wed",0

Three separate storms hit me as I climbed over a set of PUD's (pointless ups and downs), over 2 mountains Sassafras and Justus, and finally to Gooch Shelter. I can't begin to describe how much I dislike PUD's. You climb up to the top and there is nothing there but trees, not even a view. Then it's back down only to go back up to another nothing top. It's as though the people who put the trail in said ""look there's a mountain top with nothing, let's go there. Look there's another and another, we need to include them also"". All they do is sap your strength.It was pouring down rain when I finally made it to the shelter. All the tent pads had standing water in them so I shuffle d over to the shelter expecting it to be full. It was only about half full with plenty of room for me. Thank God. I was just about spent from the days hiking and really did not need to deal with putting my tent up in the rain.Forgot to mention I had my first fall today. While coming down an enbankment to cross Justus Creek in the rain I slipped on the Mudd and down I went.

Only problem is that my nemisis Blood Mountain sits in the way and my back continues to give me trouble. At 4457' Blood is the tallest mountain in Georgia on the AT. I set off full of optimism but soon my back and legs, that feel they are made of lead, have me moving at a snail's pace. I stop for a lunch break and this turned into almost an hour long rest. Expecting this to turn the tide of my problems but I find it a struggle to stand. There's nothing for it but to shoulder my pack and dig deeper. After what seems forever I make the summit of Blood Mtn. It is with a heavy heart that I call Mrs. Bampa. I decide that with the trouble that my back is causing that I should not continue past Neel Gap. It would be disastrous to get somewhere remote and have my back go out and not able to move. Time to listen to what my body is telling me, it is time to stop. 
At 3:00 I set off down the mountain. It's only 2.4 miles but becomes a real struggle to get to the hostel. What a pile of rocks to get around and over. At 5:30 it's already too late to get pizza at the outfitters. I need to get there by 6:00 as that is when they close for the day, but I still have .6 miles to go. Normally this wouldn't even get me to raise an eyebrow, but it might as well been 10 miles. Head down and full of vitamin I, (Ibuprofen) I get to the Gap with 10 minutes to spare. Checked in and paid for my bunk, collected a towel for my shower, sub sandwich and a bottle of Coke I head to the bunk room. Not only did I miss the pizza but they did not have Dr Pepper. As it turned out I did not need to pout about the pizza as there were 3 other hikers in the room that couldn't finish theirs. Let's just say the score was 5 slices of pizza, 1 sub and the bottle of Coke. After a shower and a call to Mrs. Bampa to confirm I'm done I pile into bed.
Blood Mountain is my Kryptonite. Two attempts and two fails, both at the same place. I think I need a new plan. But at least I'm done with that mountain.

Bampa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610530,"Arrived home the evening of Saturday, 4/13. A long uneventful if somewhat painful drive. Today was a chriopractic appointment where it was confirmed I have a bulging disc in my lower back. After being adjusted it is estimated that this will take 10 - 14 days to heal enough so I can start walking for distance again.
The cool thing about driving for 7 hrs. one day and 10 hrs. another day is that you have plenty of time to think. I said earlier in my journal that after 2 failed thru hike attempts in 2 consecutive years that I might need a new plan. My new plan is to conduct a section thru hike, this could be plan C or D. A section hike is where you hike a portion of the trail, possibly from one prominent location to another prominent location, or starting at one point on the trail and then hike for a set amount of time (weeks or months). Then to keep at hiking sections unitil the trail is completed.
Once my back and legs are up to the task I intend to go to Harper's Ferry and hike NOBO for 2 - 3 weeks. This would give me a good chance to see if this type of thru hike would fit with the way I see things.
As with everything, there are advantages and disadvantages. Hiking the AT in this manner I get to choose the season in which I hike a section. This means that by hiking during warmer weather parts of the trail I would normally need to carey cold weather clothing, that clothing no longer is needed. This translates to a lighter pack which can only help my back.  Another advantage is that I won't be gone from home as long as I would on a thru hike of 6 months. Being gone for 2, 3 or 4 weeks would be less stressful on Mrs. Bampa as she cares for her mom and runs our home and finances. Disadvantages, I will hike with other people for only these short periods of time and probably not see them again. Also, as I jump around on the trail there could be fewer people to hike with as they will be in the hiker bubble as it moves steadily along the trail. My dream of doing a continues thru hike will become what resembles a patchwork quilt. But then, I like quilts as they are warm and beautiful works that people invest incredible detail and time in creating. Finally, a section hike will take years to complete.

My back did not recover as quickly as expected. There were 4 - 5 visits to the chiropractor and there was even a discussion about surgery. That one I vetoed. What has helped a great deal is in early July I started working out at the local YMCA 4 times a week. The exercise program involves upper and lower body along with cardio.
A new stake has been put in the ground. Sept. 3rd should see me starting at Harper's Ferry and hiking north for 4 weeks. Still not sure if a section hike is for me but this would be a good taste. What then could happen for 2020, after exercising thru the winter, is to pick up at Neel Gap and hike to Harper's Ferry. Skip ahead to where I leave off this fall and make the push to Katahdin.

Took a blue blaze access trail to get to the AT. Hiked along bottom of cliffs and got down into Old Town Harper's Ferry. Out to the point formed by the Shenandoah and Patomic rivers. Then across on the rail bridge with a freight train going by. Good thing I'm a train buff. Down the spiral stairs to the C & O Canal and bike path. 2 miles later left the bike path and started a 1200 foot climb. 
My original plan was to go to Crampton Shelter, about 11 miles. But about 5 miles from that shelter I found a hiker sitting in the middle of the trail. I walked up and said hi and he says I'm blind. He had fallen and lost his sense of direction and had no idea where the trail was. There was no way I was going to leave this guy, so after giving him some snacks, Gatorade and vitamin I guided him the 1 mile to the next shelter, Ed Garvy Shelter. This took about 2 hours and once there he insisted I continue on to my destination. It's now really late and I have 3 miles to go to Gathland S.P. to get water and then another mile to my shelter. Got to S.P. around 7:30 with just enough light to find the water spigot. By the time I finished getting water and having supper it's well after 8:00 and I'm done in. Decided to stay at S.P. but the only problem was they do not allow camping. Decided to keep a low profile and not put up my tent. As I wanted to be out of sight I checked out the men's room. It turned out to be really clean and didn't even smell. Moved in and set up on the floor and then discovered the over head motion detector that turns on the lights is very sensitive. I managed to turn the lights on 3 times in quick succession and gave up on this. Dragged my sleeping bag and pad out to the end of the restroom building where there was a roof overhang. Got almost no sleep but did not get jumped by a park ranger.

The weather today was again hot and about 2:30 I came to an oasis on the AT. Dalhgren Backpacking Camp Ground, free to backpackers. This place has it all, large flat camping area, picnic tables, bear pole, bath house, showers with warm water, flush toilets, sinks with counter space and outlets for charging your electronics.

At some point during the day I met a lady who said I would be getting into Pine Nob Shelter early and that I should hike the 2 miles to Annapolis Rocks.

What I thought would be a short day turned into a rock scramble. Rocks covering the trail, for what felt like miles, turned over both ankles. Don't know how many times my hiking staff saved me from falling. While coming down off a ridge line heading for MD 17 had to go thru several rock scrambles that made me stop and put an ankle brace on my left ankle. Made it to Ensign Cowall in one piece and a little unnerved from stumbling around on the rocks.
Had the shelter to myself untill a young couple on a south bound section hike arrived. Turns out the girl has 3 brothers who are all Eagle Scouts. Boy, did the 3 of us have good conversations.

After standing at the roadside for 40 minutes and having trucks and cars drive past without stopping I was beginning to doubt my wisdom for hitching. Finally a guy in a pickup truck stops and says to throw my pack in the back and he'll drive me wherever I need to go. I never go grocery shopping on a empty stomach so I was dropped at the Dixie Diner. Great breakfast, reasonable prices and friendly staff who knows the first names of all the regulars and everyone else is called Honey. Just as my food arrived a guy walks in and looks around and comes straight to my table. Introduces himself as Lee and tells me he has been section hiking the AT and would be happy to shuttle me where I need to go including a return to the trail crossing. Only problem is he has an appointment at his church at 9:00. I get his cell number and he leaves for an errand. My watch says it's 7:55 and in an hour I'll miss this great opportunity for a ride back to trail. I woof down my breakfast, grab my pack that I had left outside the restaurant and speed hike the half mile to a Dollar General arriving at 8:30. Oh man, I don't think I will make Lee's deadline for a ride. Into the store and I pulled a 4 day resupply off the shelves in record time. Called Lee and he will be there in 30 seconds. He is pulling up as I come out with backpack and 2 plastic bags of groceries. Everything is tossed into the back of his car and we are off to the trail crossing. You thank trail angels at least 3 times but I thanked Lee at least a dozen times. From the time I was picked up at the roadside untill I was dropped off was only 90 minutes. This had to be some kind of a record.
I head for Ravin Rock Shelter which includes a rugged climb of 1000 feet over you guessed it, rocks. The view from Raven Rock Cliff was well worth the effort. Arrived at the shelter at 1:00 and it is way to early to stop hiking. After lunch I head out for mile marker 1067.0 for the Falls Creek campsite.

This first climb of the day wasn't too bad as it was only a 1,000 feet. The second climb was shorter but had serious rock scrambles, go figure.

Not sure what the elevation gain is but it felt like it was straight up. At the top is a large rock with a bronze placque identifying this as the midpoint for the original AT. Walking into Boiling Springs you walk thru farm fields for corn and soy beans. While walking between a soy bean field and a field that has been harvested of corn, a flock of Canadian Geese flies in front me by about 100 yards and goes further over the harvested field. That's when all hell breaks loose. Hunters in the field open up and after what sounded like both hunters emptying their shotguns, one goose falls from the sky. Normally this would not bother me, as I hunt too, but these guys were shooting up into the air and across the trail. All those pellets had to land someplace.
Starts to rain as I get into Boiling Springs, what a nice little town. The ATC mid Atlantic office is not open for another hour. There is a fishing tackle shop with some hiking gear, I pickup a cylinder of Nunn electrolyte replacements. On to Caffe 101 for breakfast, what a hiker friendly place. Hikers are welcomed, pack and all. I was given a nice table against a wall where there is a wall outlet for recharging. While waiting for my breakfast I noticed a waitress clearing dishes from a couple at the table next to me. It looked like she hardly ate any of her Home Fries and I almost asked if she was done with those. Guess I need to be out longer before I can pull a Yogi.
At the ATC office I confirm that my idea to hike the 14 miles from Boiling Springs to Darlington Shelter, making an 18 mile day, is not so far fetched. The ground is mostly flat with some easy bumps along the way. There is no water till the end when you hike over some streams that are farm field fed. I could treat that water 3 times and still not want to drink it. About 1 mile short of the shelter is a piped spring and then a 400 foot vertical climb up to the shelter.
As I walk out of Boiling Springs I put my plan for hiking 18 miles in motion. I put a call into Mrs. Bampa and ask if she can pick me up in Duncannon early, 24 hours early. This all depends on me reaching Darlington tonight. We leave the original plan in place for a Monday pick up unless she hears from me otherwise. I make it to the shelter at 8:00 and in darkness, but then this is why we carry hands free headlamps. I call home and I will be picked up on Sunday instead of Monday. ?
