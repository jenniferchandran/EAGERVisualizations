Waffles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625893,"I have most of my gear figured out and completed an 80 mile solo backpack in 4 days on the Rogue River trail in Southern Oregon just before Christmas. There were some lessons learned on that so I'll be making a few adjustments. Prodigious amounts of rain on two of the days caused me to hike with wet feet and that led to some blisters. I never get blisters, so I was not prepared to deal with that. My boots were old and had broken side seams - was using this hike to use up the last miles on them. I had rain pants but no gaiters, so the rain generally ran off my legs right into my shoes. All this could be better. I already have my new boots, so will be breaking them in, and I'll get a pair of gaiters too.I just finished reading AWOL's book and he bitched about rain a lot, as well as blisters and other foot problems. Since I hope to start in April and be done by late May, I know I'll have some rain to deal with and I'll be prepared for that.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Tue",0
Waffles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626065,"I finished 4 training hikes in the last 10 days, including an 8-mile, 1300 ft elevation gain; 6-mile, 1000 ft; 13-mile, 3000 ft in hard rain; and 8-mile, 1500 ft elevation gain in light snow. All of these with a 15 lb pack. No major issues. Ready for longer days.",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Mon",0
