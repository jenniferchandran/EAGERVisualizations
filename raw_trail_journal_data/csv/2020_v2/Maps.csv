One of the good things about hiking with my brother is we will be able to share some items, cutting back on us both having to carry the same item. For some reason, I just can't get him to share toothbrushes so we can save two ounces!",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Sun",0
Maps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626237,"Deciding what to bring has been a fun part of the planning.  I have spent hours staring at labels in the grocery store and creating various spreadsheets.  It's been a little bit like a game figuring out what food I want to eat every day for five months and how to add variety so I don't get sick and tired of the same food.  Right now, five days of food weighs about 8 lbs and averages about 3,700 calories a day.  Granola for breakfast, nuts and fruit (GORP) for morning snack, peanut butter and honey wraps or meat and cheese wraps for lunch, granola bar for afternoon snack, and dehydrated beans for dinner make up the base of my foods.  Did you know 32 corn chips weigh one ounce and carry 160 calories?  Crushed up, the corn chips are about 1/4 cup (sadly, still one ounce!!) and add a nice crunch to my dehydrated beans.  The many different flavors of chips are a great way to spice up my dinner each night.  Also, one ounce of potato chips is about the same as the corn chips.  Crushed up, this is a great way to add calories and crunch to my peanut butter and honey wrap.I'm sure my foods will vary based on what's available along the way and the stops in town will give me a great opportunity to add variety.",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Mon",0
Maps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626249,"For folks hiking the Appalachian Trail, it is common for hikers to go by a name that is given to them 'by the Trail'.  Sometimes it takes a while for this name to become obvious.  For me, mine came from my love of maps and the joy of planning our various hikes.  My brother got his during a family hike on the AT in Georgia shortly after he had had a knee replacement.  We were walking along the trail talking about some day hiking the AT in its entirety and someone asked if I was afraid of bears.  I said no, as long as I was hiking with my brother, I knew I could outrun him therefore making him 'bear bait'.  :-)",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Tue",0

Maps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626943,"Hi everyone
Sorry for the delay in updating my hiking information.  We have had no cell service at each of the shelters we've stayed at.  It was quite an adjustment, walking with a 30 lb pack on my back.  Fortunately, we only did a little over ten miles but it sure was enough...  After waving good-bye to Deb and Beth, we headed out, passing through forests of rhododendrons and ash/oak trees.  It was a nice up and down kind of day and we made it to Lost Mountain Shelter by 2:30 pm.  As we were alone in the shelter, we set out our sleeping bags, got water and relaxed with a cigar until it was dinner time at 4:30 pm :-)  We were joined by Cody, a thru hiker, who had started in Damascus on Jan 24th.  We chatted until 7:30 pm and then headed to bed.  The wind was blowing and the temperature was in the mid to low 30s.  Thank goodness for a nice warm sleeping bag and my AT buff.
Best part of the day - Besides making it to the shelter, taking the time to look around.

Maps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626945,"We were up around 5:30 am, packed up and heading out on the trail with our headlamps for the first hour.  In the 12+ miles, we had 8 miles of uphill.  We had torrential rains from 3:00 am to 5:00 am but fortunately, the rain held off until we were about 15 minutes from the shelter when it started up again.  As we were gasping for breath on the way up, we were walking through snow in a number of places and fighting strong and cold winds.  The shelter is near Mt. Rogers which is a favorite hiking destination.  We are also in the Grayson Highlands where there are wild ponies.  The National Park Service introduced them into the area in the early 1960s to keep the vegetation down.  Each year, the ponies are rounded up, inspected and the herd controlled.  Because of the ponies, many people visit the area.  The shelter and surrounding areas were an absolute mess!!  We were able to stay in the bottom floor while five other hikers stayed upstairs.  The wind and rain continued all night long and the night was miserable!!!!  
Best part of the day - waking up to rain and not getting any until 15 minutes before getting to the shelter.

",Thomas Knob Shelter,"Mar 10, Tue",12.30
Maps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626948,"Fantastic day!!!  Since the shelter was at 5,700 feet, we froze at Thomas Knob Shelter.  We were only too happy to pack up and head out in the fog and mist.  We were using our headlamps again and it was slow going until we got down off the top of the knob and entered into the Grayson Highlands.  As we were standing in the meadows of the Highlands, we saw an incredible sunrise.  After a couple attempts at pictures, we continued on and was about a dozen wild ponies.  It was incredible and reminded me of the meadow up on top of Mt. Katahdin in Maine!!!  The weather was absolutely perfect and we did a big push and got to Old Orchard Shelter at 3 pm.  We were there by ourselves and took our time getting set up and ready for the next day.  As the sun went down, the temperatures dropped into the low 30s.  We had another night of huddling in our sleeping bags and listening to the wind howling through the gaps in the logs of the shelter.    
Each of the shelters we have stayed at have had metal boxes for us to store our food.  This is a big area for bears and we have been fortunate not to see any or any signs of them.  We are being careful not to keep any food items in our packs so the mice and bears stay away from us... :-)
Best part of the day - watching the sunrise and seeing the wild ponies in Grayson Highlands.

Maps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626949,"Today, we hiked the furthest we have done so far with our packs.  We were on the trail early with our headlamps and had an absolutely perfect walk with a full moon on our left and a sunrise on our right.  It was really nice walking through the rhododendrons and ash/oak trees.  Due to a bridge being out, we had to detour off the Trail and walk 2.2 miles on the road back to the Trail.  The walking was miserable but we did see a deer.  The 13.5 miles was a push and we arrived at Trimpi Shelter around 2:30 pm.  Someone was there but they headed out as we arrived so we had the shelter to ourselves.  Every shelter we have stayed at has a privy which sits away from the shelter and it well ventilated.  The privy is a structure with a roof, short sides and lots of open walls.  Lingering is not an issue... :-)  The water source at each of the shelters has been a pipe coming out of the ground. I've been treating the water and haven't had any issues.  Since it is early spring, and there is no one else on the Trail, it would probably be safe to bring the water without treating it but I don't dare.  
Best part of the day - hiking in the full moon, watching the sunrise and completing over 13 miles!!!

Maps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626927,"We were up by 5 am, packed up and on the trail by 6 am. We used our headlamps for the first two and a half hours and made good time. We averaged two miles an hour over the ten miles and came out at Partnership Shelter at 11:00 am where Beth was waiting. We sat in the sun for a couple of hours and then made our way to our hotel. Got our packs cleaned out, got cleaned uo, and headed out for pizza and a salad. It felt good to be cleaned up and to sleep in a real bed! We will slackpack 13.5 miles tomorrow and then hit the trail for three longer days.
So far we have done 63 miles and averaged over 12 miles a day. Not too bad with a 30 lb pack...
Best part of the day - stopping on a ridge and staring out over Rye Valley.  Many times, it's so easy to just put my head down and just walk.  I am constantly stopping just to look around.  This was one place I was glad I took the time to take a break.  The clouds were still in the valley but the view was very nice...

Maps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626950,"As we are staying at a hotel, we decided to slack pack today.  We have a couple 16+ mile days coming up so we thought we would save a bit of our energy by carrying less weight.  We started out again in the dark with headlamps and had 5.5 miles up uphill right from the start.  We did well by averaging 2 mph to the top of Glade Mountain.  From there, we had 8 miles of down, level and rolling ups and downs.  We spent most of our time in the oak/ash trees and rhododendrons.  During the last four miles, we came down into farm lands and stopped for a breather at a one room school house that was built in the 1700s.  We had begun our day at 7 am and met Beth at just about 1 pm.  A short one hour break and we were back at the hotel to clean up and get ready for our next segment.
Best part of the day - Seeing the one room school house and walking on some REALLY nice trails.

We feel like we are getting our trail legs and are not having to stop so many times going up the hills.  We are getting close to being able to average 2 mph but aren't there yet.  
Best part of the day - walking through an old farm and seeing a 200+ year old barn.

Maps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627072,"What a miserable night!!!! and the coldest yet!!!  When we went to bed, we could feel the temperatures dropping.  When we woke up in the morning, it was below 30 degrees and I saw snow flying around with my headlamp.  I slept last night in my down jacket with my hat and gloves on.  Boy, I sure did hate getting up!!  We quickly headed out in the cold and the mist and had a nice first four miles of gentle rolling terrain.  We then had 5.5 miles of straight up.  Imagine getting on a treadmill, setting it at a 75 degree angle, 1.5 mph and walking for 5.5 miles.  I can honestly say I have never done this before today.  The clouds stayed with the entire day.Nova stayed with us for the first 6 or 7 miles and then moved on ahead.  At noon time, we made it to the top of Chestnut Knob and had lunch at the Chestnut Knob Shelter.  The shelter was a fully enclosed stone building.  Someone forgot to turn on the heat so it was just about as cold inside as it was out.  Fortunately, we were out of the wind and mist.  As we got to within a mile of the top (4,400 feet), we saw ice forming on the grass and bushes.  At the top of Chestnut Knob, everything has at least 1/4 inch of ice on it.  As we were heading down the mountain, chunks of ice were falling on our heads!!!Since this was going to be our longest day yet, and our first 15+miles, we decided we would stay at the Mountain Garden Hostel.  This saved us having to carry the weight of our hammocks which is about 4-5 pounds.  Although about twice the weight of a tent, the hammocks are a lot more flexible.  We have found a lot more places to hang a hammock than we have to set up a tent!As I said in the title, this was the cloudy day that just never seemed to end.  From the top of Chestnut Knob, we had 6 miles of rolling steep ups and steep downs.  Trail conditions had been really nice UP UNTIL THIS POINT so we figured we would be out of the woods by 3 pm.  If you have ever been hiking in the White Mountains and walked on a rocky trail, constantly slipping, sliding, twisting and turning, you can imagine what we were walking on.  The trail really took it's toll on us and we kept thinking the last up and down would be our last until finally, it was!!!We were met at the trail head and brought to the hostel.  It is a 200+ year old farm house under new management.  A lot of work was being done on the outside and stuff was everywhere.  We looked at ourselves and wondered what we had gotten ourselves into.  We were pleasantly surprised when we walked into the hostel.  The inside was very nice and were were able to get a private room with two beds.  Mine was a huge four poster bed that I had to roll up onto and it had a pillow top mattress!!!  Some different than a 2 1/2 in air mattress on a hard wood shelter floor.We quickly fell asleep at 8 pm and didn't wake up until around 4:00 am.  What a great night sleep and needed as we were going to push ourselves even further by doing 16.4 miles the next day.Best part of the day - seeing the bushes beginning to bud out and then seeing everything covered in ice at Chestnut Knob Shelter.I walked 47,000 steps today.","Knot Maul Shelter

Maps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627070,"Today was our longest and fastest yet and we sure did feel it at the end of the day.  We stayed at the Mountain Garden Hostel last night and enjoyed a nice soft clean bed and eight hours of uninterrupted sleep!  It was nice not shivering in my sleeping bag!!  We started off in the dark as usual with a couple miles of uphill walking and then settled into continuous walking up and down... :-)  As I kept telling myself all along the way, 'It's just walking.'  It helped our pack were without the weight of our hammocks and food but we were still carrying about 20 pounds.  The flora and fauna is beginning to change and it was almost like stepping over a line when the rhododendrons disappeared and the mountain laurel began.  Instead of walking through tunnels of rhododendrons, we were brushing past mountain laurel.  When we left the hostel, we had been told to expect rain to start around 10 am and come down continuously all day long.  We were glad the weathermen were wrong again!!!  We did have to wear our rain gear for a little bit but were soon able to pack it away and keep on keeping on!!  As we were walking along, we came to an area that had a deep ravine and a rock slide that had to be about 200 yards long.  In the brown of the leaves from last fall was this long jumble of rocks, of all sizes, covered in a bright green moss or algae.  A little further down the trail, we saw granite cliffs covered in the same bright green moss or alge.  The stark difference in color really made the rocks stand out.After 15.4 miles yesterday, and 16.4 miles today, we were glad to see Beth, take off our packs, and head to Pearisburg where we will be staying in an Air BNB for three or four nights. Best part of the day - watching six hawks continuously landing in trees in front of us and then flying off to catch a thermal.  A couple of times, we were able to walk right in under the tree the hawks were sitting in.  What big, amazing birds!  We felt a whole lot more comfortable when they were circling away from is and not over us.I walked 48,000 steps today.","Mountain Garden Hostel

Today was an absolutely perfect day for a hike.  No, the sun wasn't shining (as a matter of fact it rained) but the hills were not as steep as the map showed and the trails were not as rocky as they had been.  The entire 12.2 miles was nothing but a relaxing walk... :-)
The advice given to people that have to stop hiking the Appalachian Trail is to finish on a good day.  This way, every memory I have of the time spent on the Trail is a positive one.  I did better than this - I finished on a GREAT day!!!
