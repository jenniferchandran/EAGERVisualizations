LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631941,"It's 12 miles to the next shelter at Gentian Pond. My plan is, was that I would have hiked this section last August in one day. But doing 12 miles today I know will be a stretch. The days are long in June with day light until the 9 o'clock hour so leaving at 10:45 meant if I could maintain just a 1.2 mile per hour pace I could get to Gentian Pond before it got dark. Then, would there be a space for me in the shelter, I won't know until I got there. I've only been shut out of a shelter once in all the nearly 1900 miles I've walked on the AT over the last 10 years and that was in Virginia in the middle of the north bound surge of NOBO's of the year 2015. I wasn't sure I would want to do 12 miles on my first day, not having trained and being over weight and carrying a heavy pack, enough food for 10 days with the idea of avoiding going into trail towns for resupply as much as possible. Yet I had options.
My good friend, Royster, drove me in my car up to the trail head this morning and dropped me off. This being in the COVID era, we only stopped to get gas and a quick snack at the Cumberland Farms in Gorham, NH.

Last year, I had started my SOBO section of the Whites from this same location.
It was a warm and sunny day and I had great expectations for this section of the AT despite the COVID-19 situation that I have been monitoring in Maine since like forever. I figured the pandemic was not much of a threat for this part of the AT and its surrounding communities but just in case I thought that I could resupply in Rangeley and Munson for 10 days each and since there was 300 miles in this section it would be like doing 3 100-mile Wilderness transits. I still carried a mask but was going to let the trail dictate the proper protocols for Covid safety and etiquette. So, as I started out from the Rattle River Trail Head I had a short bit of road walk before I turned into the forest and the long uphill to the top of Mahoosuc Ridge. Upon crossing the Androscoggin River at the next intersection the trail turns left onto a dirt road and it was there that I encountered a group of ecotourists on bicycles, maybe 8 to 10 taking a break next to their support vehicle. I kept to the opposite side of the road leaving them way more than 3 times the 6 foot Covid separation distance and only talked to them for a minute or two before moving on by. That seemed to work but I wasn't on a narrow confined trail yet. That would change quickly. 

On my way up to the ridge line, about a 2 1/2 mile climb, the heat and the weight of my pack made for slow going, and then the leg cramps kicked in. I needed to stop and rest often and it took me to 3 pm to gain the first mountain, Mt Hayes. On one of my stops up the mountain, a young couple, Toe and Cornflake, passed me going SOBO and stopped to chat for a few minutes. We kept our distance but didn't reach for our masks either. Being outside in fresh air and able to social distance was apparently OK in the hiking community. They had started their hike at Abol Bridge in the first week of June and had made good time over those 285 miles. Baxter Park will open on July 1st so their plan is to flip back to do Katahdin at the end of July. (ed. note: when I when through Katahdin Aug. 2-3 I did not see them and didn't see their names on the register.) They did say that many NOBO's had already summited, stealthily, when they started in June. We both passed with a wide berth and continued on. By now I was coming to a quick realization that I should make sure to get to Trident Col and call it a day there. 

A solo light weight young hiker passed me going SOBO so fast I thought he was a day hiker. Later, I found out he is a thru hiker doing big miles. I'm glad I have a flexible itinerary and can adjust my pace as I go. At about 7 pm, I reached the top of Cascade Mountain and in this selfie the lower parts of the Carters and Moriahs mountains are seen clear as a bell across the Andoscoggin River Valley. I had hiked them SOBO last August. I still had a little over a mile to go before I reached Trident Col Campsite and I had little water left so I definitely needed to go the the campsite to get water for the night.
About 8 pm I finally found the tent platforms which are just cleared off dirt sites with no picnic bench or food prep area that I could find. The campsite is down a blue blazed trail with the water off to the side but the first thing you see is the privy which, in all my camping experience, is not usually that prominent. So after a bit of snooping around I settled on this spot and, being the only one here, set up and got water to re-hydrate. You can see my food bags but I had lost my appetite so I just worked on drinking water and Propel for electrolytes and resting in the tent. At around 10, I knew I wouldn't be eating so after stowing the food in the Bear Box, I just went to bed with the fly open all night as the evening was fair with no threat of rain. I was so tired and sleepy.","US Rte 2, Gorham, NH

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631985,"Only 4.9 miles today as my pack fully loaded and I carry way too much food and gear. Just one good climb today up to Wocket Ledge. There, around 11 in the morning I rested and at just a granola bar. Then I made my way on to the shelter but needed to set up and get water before settling in for a late lunch around 3:30. The trail today wound around several mountain ponds but there was little wildlife to be seen except mosquitoes so I did not stop. I ate a PB&J wrap and then just relaxed and rested as some other hikers came and left. By nightfall several NOBO's had taken up inside the shelter, one of which =, Dirt Nap, talked with me some. She was just a nice young woman from Atlanta on a through hike. I had a dinner of Thai noodles and tuna which  satisfied my appetite for the evening. everyone was down and out for the night as soon as dusk settled in.
This is the view from the shelter as I have just arrived at around 2:30. Looking into Gentian Pond Shelter, I begin to settle in and am about to go down to the pond to retrieve some water.The Shelter is on a rock outcropping right above the pond just a few steps down to the edge of the water.
As I was drawing water from the pond a single duck came paddling right by, checking me out. The weather today was in the 60's and 70's with some sun and clouds and high humidity and gentle breezes but no thunder or rain.","Trident Col Tentsite

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632094,"Today I hiked out of New Hampshire.

And I walked into the State of Maine, the first time I've walked any of the AT in Maine. But before I arrived at the State line there is one major mountain to climb, Mt Success.

The view of this selfie of me at the summit of Mt Success shows the trail over board walks called puncheons in the mountain top marshes that are sometimes found near the summits. This is looking north and over the near ridge just off the trail is the crash site of a DC-3 that is a popular destination for day hikers. The Summit at 3565 feet does not support large trees and can be environmentally fragile so where the trail passes over marshy areas there are wooden puncheons to walk on. While I was taking a lunch break here a father and young son came by on their day hike to visit the plane wreckage. I didn't have cell phone coverage at Gentian Pond, so on the first climb this morning I stopped and was able to connect to Linda for a short call with her. Just after putting the phone away and starting again up the climb, I lost my balance and took a backwards fall which kind of surprised me. I was able to land on my pack in what is known as a ""turtle landing"" them roll over and sort things out. I skinned my knee and had a sore hip but nothing major... except later this evening I discovered my headlamp wouldn't work.

I'm only going shelter to shelter until I regain my trail legs and drop some weight. This is the view down a precipitous drop into Carlo Col. This was one of two technical climbs I encountered today but I took my time and got through them fine. I hope Mahoosuc Notch isn’t any worse. I'll find out day after tomorrow.

Three tenths of a mile down a side trail does not bring anyone else to share this shelter with me tonight.
The temps are very mild tonight with overcast, as it has been all day, and I look forward to a restful sleep.","Gentian Pond Shelter

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632001,"Today's walk, although not difficult physically, was one to remember for what happened to a lone hiker in the year 2013. Geraldine Largay, Inchworm, was her name. She became lost on this section of the AT one day, a Monday, in late July and eventually, her body was recovered over 2 years later. She suffered no physical injuries during her ordeal, only the confusion and the loneliness and the inability to know what she could do to help those who could find her.","Poplar Ridge Lean-to
