Hooch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626501,"Thirty days from now I’ll take a step off Springer Mountain in Georgia onto the Appalachian Trail and begin walking north, with the hopes of making it to Mt Katahdin in Maine, the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, before mid-October. Any time past Indigenous Peoples Day snowstorms big enough to close down the mountain trails are possible.I’m aiming to finish in 6 months, which puts me at Mt Katahdin roughly the first week of September-still with another 4-6 weeks as a buffer. Folks younger than my almost-59 years, leaner than my 30 pounds overweight and who haven’t smoked cigarettes half of their adult life can usually complete the AT in 4 1/2 to 6 months. But I’m not rushing. I’m particularly going to ease into my daily mileage for the first month, working my way up to an average of 15 miles a day. One exciting aspect of my hike is that I’m taking pledges for donations based on the number of miles I walk (2,190 is the official 2020 length). All donations will go to Aucocisco School, a non-profit special purpose school in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. As soon as I figure out how, I will post a link here to the donation page. More about Aucocisco, their mission, and their community later.I’m giddy with excitement, and overwhelmed by the dozens of tasks I still need to do before I’m good to go. It’s 1:30 in the morning and I’m wide awake, trying to nail down a realistic itinerary and plan town stops for resupply. I think I’ll watch ‘A Walk in the Woods’ again.",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Wed",0
Hooch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626308,"Short answer? Yeah, probably. In 30 short days I’m going to step onto the Appalachian Trail atop Springer Mountain in Georgia and take the first of an estimated 5 million steps as I stumble 2,190 miles north to Mount Katahdin in Maine. Marching to a different drum line than those around me has been sort of a pattern for me throughout my life; and while that proclivity has often led me to take a fork or two in the road when I came to them the journey was always worth it. 
This fork in my road, the one that leads to my upcoming journey, is one I’ve wanted to take for over 45 years. I first learned of the Appalachian Trail when I was about thirteen. I was babysitting for neighbors and when the children were all in bed I perused their parents’ bookshelves. In a Time-Life series volume I came across an article about the Appalachian Trail, and I was hooked immediately. At the time, my “camping” experience was limited to sleeping in a pup tent in the backyard and the longest hike I’d been on to date was a 5 mile jaunt around Lake Waban with my Girl Scout troop. I was not deterred. The very idea of being so completely self-sufficient  that I could live out of a pack on my back in wilderness for 6 months gave me goose bumps of excitement. The prospect of having nothing to do all day but walk through the woods, make camp, sit around a fire and sleep outdoors seemed like the most idyllic life I could imagine. 
The intervening 45 years have heaped a big dose of reality upon my sunshine on my shoulders dreams of the trail. I’ve been lost, cold, wet, injured, and hungry in the woods. I’ve encountered bears a half dozen times now (one notable Yosemite bear ripped our tent down, snapped the poles and rummaged through  our gear one snowy evening). I’ve cursed myself for attempting strenuous hikes that made me weep softly to myself, repeating over and over that all I wanted was some cocoa and a warm bed.
And yet my passion for the AT has not waned, but grown. My determination to hike from end to end in one continuous journey has become THE goal of my life. I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the life I have that allows me to pursue this dream.

Hooch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626920,"Here I am! Hiked up Springer to the beginning of the AT from Forest Service road 1 mile north, then came back down the same way and continued on 2.8 miles to the Stover Creek shelter area. After several days of rain the fog lifted last night, and today was mostly sunny but cold and windy. Wind chills in the 20°s; temps expected to be low 20°s tonight with wind chill approaching 0°. I’ve been comfortable all day, and am now quite comfortable in my tent. 

So far I’m pleased with the choices I’ve made regarding gear. I ended up replacing my 10 year old pack and tent, and the pack especially is making a big difference. The clerk at REI worked with me to get a pack that fits my torso well, and that good fit makes the pack feel almost like part of my body-like I’m a tortoise and the pack is my shell. 

Had a big breakfast at Amicalola Falls Lodge this morning, and a couple of croissants on the drive to the trailhead. Not hungry at all while hiking or right after, but I forced myself to eat a Clif Bar and a homemade brownie (thank you Shannon!) I know from past backpacking trips that my appetite fluctuates; I just have to maintain a somewhat consistent blood sugar level due to Type 2 Diabetes.
I relish the prospect now of putting down my pen, turning off my headlamp, and snuggling down into my sleeping bag for the next ten or so hours.","Springer Mountain

Hooch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626922,"Very cold night. 20°, with strong winds. Beautiful cloudless day. I didn’t start out til almost 12. Had nice breakfast of tea and vegetarian curry.Walked through tunnels of rhododendrons overhanging the trail. They’re huge! It must be quite a sight when they’re in bloom. Am camping tonight at Hawk Mtn campsite, at approximately mile 7.5. Much milder tonight. Warmer, no wind, beautiful view of tonight’s moon rising over the mountains. Would be nice to do 7 miles tomorrow, getting up and over Sassafras Mountain to Gooch Shelter. Sassafras is reputed to be a fairly difficult ascent.I was surprised to have a cell signal this evening just after sunset for a little while. Sent out a few messages. 9pm, and I’m nodding off. Ciao.","Stover Creek Shelter

Hooch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626923,"Today is a ‘nearo’ day-not a ‘zero’ mileage day, but close. Only hiked to Hawk Mtn Shelter from campsite about .8 mile away. About a dozen other hikers here, they all seem familiar with each other. Despite good intentions I was very slow getting going this morning. My muscles felt like cement just walking to the privy this morning so I’ve decided to stay here at the shelter to rest, read, and write. I have close to 100 audiobooks on my phone and am currently listening to ‘Endurance’ about Ernest Shackleton’s Antarctic Expedition.I don’t generally eat Nutella but all of a sudden it sounds pretty good to me. I broke half a molar off eating Skittles this afternoon. I’m going to leave it right here in the dirt to become a part of Hawk Mountain.Sunny, breezy, 58°. Nap time!","Hawk Mtn Campsite

Hooch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626924,"9:30 am and tent is down, making breakfast (freeze dried turkey casserole) and will hit the trail by 10:15. Must have been over 30 tents here last night by the time everyone got in! Very quiet, except for a couple of tents with the weirdest snoring noises emanating from them.Gooch Gap is about 8 miles away, there’s a shelter there. The enticingly named Devil’s Kitchen campsite is 7 miles away. It seems it should be easy to make it to either one, but the struggle is real! At least now with Daylight Savings hiking until 5 or 6 is doable. Slow and steady!1:25 pm At mile 9.2. The dreaded Sassafras Mountain is coming up in a couple of miles. Have heard several hikers speak of its difficulty. Took a little break trail side, lay back and just listened-to the wind, leaves rustling, an occasional bird, and artillery. Have heard artillery and small arms fire off and on for the last 36 hours, and saw two well equipped Army Rangers on the trail yesterday. Apparently this is an Army Ranger training area.8:30 pm I love tent time! Comfy in my sleeping bag, listening to ‘Endurance’. Did 4.2 miles today, am camped at Cooper Gap. Met No Worries on the trail earlier, and he is camped here tonight with companions from Canada. He recommends the hostel Lost on Purpose in Hiawassee GA; he met the proprietors on his thru-hike last year. He reinforced my strategy of taking it slow and easy at first. That’s how he and his wife approached their thru-hike last year, and they were successful.","Hawk Mountain Shelter
