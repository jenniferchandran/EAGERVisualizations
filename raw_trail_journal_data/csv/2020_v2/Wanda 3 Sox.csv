Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629632,"Rosie Red and I are driving from York, ME to 3rd Mtn. Parking Area on Chairback Road.   We both tested negarive for Covid and are heading north to fill in a couple of sections we missed last year and then we'll be finished.
After changing our plans multiple times, even as late as this morning,  we got to the Katahdin Ironworks gate house, paid the fee and drove several miles  on Katahdin Ironworks Rd. to the parking area.  As soon as we arrived it started raining and thundering.  So, we decided to spend the night in the car.  What an uncomfortable, miserable night with little sleep.","York, ME

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630720,"Woke up early around 5:30 because we wanted to get out of the car.  We started hiking at 6:30.  It was sunny and already muggy.  Hiked 1.4 miles up 3rd Mountain Trail to get to the AT.  I fell once before we even made it to the AT.  We hiked over Third Mountain and  Columbus Mountain.  We saw 8 SOBOs (4 of which we talked to on top of 3rd Mtn.  They let us know there was water at Chairback Gap Shelter.  This saved us from having to carry enough water there for the rest of the day and tomorrow morning.)  We also met a NOBO while taking a break at a stream.
Got to the shelter at 1:00. We found a spot to pitch our tent, went down to the creek for water (a steep climb down and back up) and to the shelter to eat lunch.  After all that we decided to pitch our tent in a better place on the trail past the shelter where it was more level.  Glad we didn't  set up our tent earlier.  We were the only ones at the shelter area tonight. ","3rd Mtn.

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630721,"Started hiking at 7:00.  The first obstacle we hit was the ""slide"" down Chairback Mountain.  It was a steep rock scramble.  Took it slow and made it down with no issues.  At the bottom we went straight but very quickly remembered  that Guthook had a comment that you need to go left at the bottom or you will be off-trail and end up at a dead end and have to climb back up.
We somehow missed the trail to East Chairback Pond.  We hadn't planned to go there but we walked and walked and couldn't figure out where that trail branched off.   We finally met 3 SOBOs who said we must have missed it.  We told them there was water at the shelter and they were ecstatic because they did have to carry water up the slide.
Got to Katahdin Ironworks Road and got some smelly water and ate lunch.  We still had 2.7 miles of road walk to get to the car.  Long, dusty, hot walk.  We hid our packs off the road so we wouldn't  have to carry them.  So happy to get back to the car and turn on the air conditioner.  We only hiked 6.5 total today but it was so hot and muggy we were miserable.  Drove to pick up our packs and then headed to Bangor for the night.","Chairback Gap Shelter

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630731,"Stayed at the Colonial Inn last night in Bangor.  Drove to Stonybrook Campground in Grafton Notch this morning.  It rained last night and rain is forecast all weekend so we are staying at the Ash Lean-to where we stayed a couple years ago.  We will stay there until Tuesday because our reservations in Baxter State Park don't start until Wednesday.
Even with all the rain we enjoyed our time at the campground.  Did laundry, relaxed and did a little sightseeing in the area.  Picked up supplies for our Katahdin hike.","Bangor, ME

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630732,"Today we drove to Medway, ME (4 hrs) which will put us a couple hours from Baxter State Park for tomorrow. Ate lunch at the Penobscot River but had to eat in the car because it was too cold for a picnic.  Checked into the hotel at 1:00 and finished our chores in preparation for tomorrow.","Grafton Notch, NH

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630733,"We drove to Baxter State Park and stopped at the Visitor's Center, then drove to Roaring Brook parking lot.  Hiked 3.3 miles to Chimney Pond Campground where we have a reservation for a lean-to.  Took us about 3.5 hours with many stops to talk to day hikers, a ranger and to eat lunch.  Set up our tent in the lean-to and rearranged our gear into slackpacks for our climb up Katahdin.  It is beautiful here.  Chimney Pond is surrounded by mountains and there are even a couple of small patches of snow midway up the mountains.
We saw a snowshoe hare hop by several times.  That's the first one we've seen.  Hung our food bags on the bear line.  All the camping sites were full and so was the bear line.  Very cold tonight, down to 47 degrees.","Medway, ME

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630734,"Left at 8:15 to summit Katahdin via the Saddle Trail.  We were the second group to leave.  The first mile was not too difficult.  We met a couple of hikers headed up also and Rosie Red made the comment it was getting hot and that we had  forgotten our sunscreen.  They offered us SPF 40 or SPF 100.  We gratefully and quickly slathered on the SPF 100.  They were truly Trail Angel's.  Thank you both.  We probably would have been burnt badly or have had to turn back to camp without their generosity.
We put our poles away when we reached the Slide. It was rock scrambling straight up loose rocks for .2 mile.  Took forever.  At one point a soccer-size rock above us started rolling down, coming our way and we got over to the edge as far as we could and luckily it stopped rolling before it got to us.  When we got to the top of the Slide we saw that we had another mile to hike to the summit.  It was totally exposed  and the trail was all rocks, reminding me of Pennsylvania.  Real ankle-busters.  Then rock scrambles thrown in.  Finally made it to the summit at 2:00 after getting an energy chew from a kind hiker who took pity on us.
There were only a few hikers at the top.  We took lots of pictures.  The views were spectacular and the sky was clear.  We both were too scared to stand on the crossbar of the Katahdin sign.  Unfortunately the sign was weather beaten and you could read nothing but Katahdin on it.  It seems they replace the sign every 2-3 years and it's  time to do that.  We met a couple just starting their SOBO hike and gave them some advice and wished them well.
Ate lunch and started back down at 2:45.  Made decent time until we got to the Slide.  Spent most of our time booty scooting.  Lots of loose gravel and rock scrambling.  Finally made it back to Chimney Pond at 7:00pm.  What a day!!!","Chimney Pond Campground

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630735,"Woke up to fog on the mountains and rain forecast.  We had reservations for another night but decided to try to beat the rain and hike back to the car.   When we were almost down we saw 3 hikers that we had met earlier in the morning on their way to the summit.  The ranger at Chimney Pond had strongly advised them not to continue up the mountain due to strong winds.  So they were headed back to the parking lot.  We were so fortunate to have had beautiful weather to summit yesterday.  We almost made it to the car before it started raining. We drove to the Country Inn in Bangor.
It's  been six years of section hiking to complete the whole AT.  The first year I only hiked 85 miles before spraining my ankle and having to go home.  This year we just finished short sections to complete the trail.  So the majority of miles were done in 4 years.
Rosie Red (my sister) hiked Vermont,  New Hampshire and Maine with me.  I never would have finished without her company, support and encouragement.
What a journey!  My thanks to all the hikers who made the journey enjoyable and a special thank you to all the Trail Angels who helped us and saved us on many occasions.","Chimney Pond Campground
