Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628338,My son and I hit the trail at Amicalola tomorrow. Very excited! He'll be joining me for the first few days of my late season thruhike. Long drive ahead of us from Pennsylvania. More to follow.,,View Entry,"Jun 01, Mon",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628356,"My son and I left Pennsylvania in a rental and got as far as South Carolina before pulling over to a rest stop for the night. Drive - eat - gas - drive - drive - eat - drive - gas - drive - sleep. Should be on the trail late tomorrow morning. Beautiful green mountains in Virginia. Lots of truck traffic on I-81. Looks like things are getting back to normal.My last piece of gear arrived one hour before we left: a Zpacks Duplex tent. Was delayed a week in production so I only had a chance to pitch it and couldn't test it. Hopefully I made the right choice. My old Copper Spur has seen about 3000 miles and I don't trust it to last a thruhike. I took the opportunity to drop a lot of weight - 58 ounces for the Copper Spur vs 22 ounces for the Duplex, including stakes. That brings me close to ten pounds base weight. Now my Osprey Exos pack is the heaviest item. It too is showing its age and may get replaced soon. Looking at going frameless. My son needs a new trail name. Used to be Phantump when we hiked in Pennsylvania a few years ago. He's grown out of Pokemon though. We'll see what happens.",,View Entry,"Jun 02, Tue",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628367,"We woke up in an interstate rest stop near Andersen, South Carolina, groggy and a bit stiff. Felt better after some breakfast sandwiches. We arrived in Dawsonville, Georgia by 10 to return the rental and meet our shuttle. Got a real deal on the rental - just $40 to drive it from Pennsylvania to Georgia, no drop fee. Probably a Covid special.
Bret Eady picked us up and drove us to Amicalola Falls State Park where the Approach Trail starts. He greeted me with a hearty handshake, capping off a road trip that showed us people, at least outside major cities, are increasingly just getting on with their lives.  
I've used Bret a few times before. He thrued in 2017 and lives with his family in the north Georgia mountains. Business fell off a cliff in late March after the ATC asked hikers to get off the trail. The national forest service in Georgia had blocked off some AT parking areas for awhile but opened them up a couple weeks ago. The forest service in North Carolina had also announced trailhead closures but never physically closed them. But it was the action of one county in North Carolina, where Fontana Dam is located, that drove a lot of hikers off trail. The county barred any outsiders from entering, whether by car or foot, an unusual step even among the unprecedented lockdowns. That eliminated a critical resupply point for thruhikers entering the Smokies. Many decided to go home after hearing about it further back on the trail. 
At Amicalola Ethan and I had our picture taken at the arch and headed up the Approach Trail. Many families were visiting the park: hiking, at the fishing pond, and gazing at the falls. The falls are the longest cascade east of the Mississippi at 729 feet. We climbed 600 steps to reach the top, which took a lot out of us given the humidity. It was tempting to jump in. 
After a break near the lodge above the falls we hiked on, leaving the tourists behind. A few backpackers leap-frogged with us. The trail was easy walking but kept climbing and the humidity took its toll. We took frequent breaks and a long lunch before tackling Frosty Mountain. Surmounting Frosty turned the tide a bit and helped us push on. By Black Gap shelter Ethan had a headache, possibly a sugar crash after a bunch of Jolly Rogers. Vitamin I fixed him up. We struggled with water. Our two Sawyer Squeezes are a bit clogged and took forever to filter a liter. Leaky water bags didn't help. 
By late afternoon we reached Springer's summit and laid hands on the first white blaze. Two amatuer radio enthusiasts showed up, backpacking to Neel Gap. They had a device that would broadcast their coordinates by radio wave to communicate with other enthusiasts following them on a map. There are other ways to do this, of course, but this was for fun, not efficiency.
At Springer shelter a few tenters and hammockers were set up, including a couple from Massachusetts. All were hiking sections of Georgia. I looked through the logbooks today for other thruhikers starting. A couple named Beast and something else started earlier today. Looking back, a handful of thruhikers started in late March and April, sounding defiant in refusing to give up their dream in the face of mass panic. More entries in May, but mostly dayhikers and section hikers becoming active again. I'm sure I will run into a few thruhikers up the trail, but it is obviously quite late for most to start a northbound thruhike since Katahdin typically closes for winter in mid-October.
After a hearty dinner of rice and Spam(TM) we struggled some more with filtering water, chatted with the radio guys from Florida, and went off to sleep in the shelter loft. Nice sleeping weather. Supposed to storm tomorrow.","Amicalola Falls State Park
",Springer Mountain shelter,"Jun 03, Wed",0.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628391,"Nice sleeping weather. Last night we were buzzed by biting gnats at dinner but they left us alone in the shelter loft. Ethan was up a lot listening to strange sounds in the otherwise still forest. Some oatmeal perked us up.  
Our Sawyer squeeze filters are pretty clogged. It takes great effort to produce a trickle of water. The Sawyer water bags have small seam leaks so applying great pressure caused more water loss than we were filtering. So we just screwed the filters on water bottles, filled them with creek water, and filtered as we drank. Still produces only a trickle, so we spent the day trying to get enough to drink. We'll have to unclog or replace these once we reach Neel Gap, hopefully tomorrow.
It was a rocky mile descent to the gravel lot at Big Stamp Gap. Few people around before 9 am. Nice trail following Stover Creek with clean, cold water to fill up.
At Stover Creek Shelter a couple was late getting packed up. A domesticated gray tabby cat was slinking around, looking to be petted and probably fed. The couple thought the cat had followed some hikers there but no one claimed it. Ethan dubbed it Comrade Cat.
Leaving the shelter Ethan decided on Big E as his trail name. His friends gave him that thanks to being tall for his age. We passed a fungus at least a foot wide next to the trail. Big E dubbed it Humongous Fungus (see photos section).
Rhododendron forest followed as we hiked above Stover Creek, then tall hemlocks, fields of ferns, mountain laurel in bloom, occasional wildflowers like Indian paintbrush. A goldfinch bounced away as I approached. The woods were alive with bird calls. A tiny black and yellow snake froze by the side of the trail until slithering away. Large brown millipedes and smaller black and yellow centipedes occasionally crossed our path. No mammals sighted.
We stopped at Long Creek Falls to cool off and rest. A large Boulder had graffiti carved in it with the date 1877. Some old carvings looked like Spaniards or Indians might have left it. 
At Hawk Mountain Shelter we stopped for a lunch of cheddar and salami sandwiches. Four guys were hanging out near the shelter making a fire. It was their first trip on the AT and they opted to stay put this morning when the forecast called for thunderstorms. But by midday the forecast had been pushed off til evening and by then the guys had decided it was too late to get going. We left around 2pm planning to go 7 miles to the next shelter.
Several mountains stood in our way however. They, along with humidity and difficulty getting water out of our bottles, sapped our strength. Sassafras was the toughest, a 700 foot ascent. In cooler weather it would have been more manageable. Still, we made it, even surviving the morale hit of a false summit. Big E and I cried our barbaric Yawps over the rooftops of the world when we made the summit.
The next few miles became a bit of a trudge. With no water sources we had no choice but to get to Justus Creek at least. Climbing over the much smaller Justus Mountain took some out of us, and the long downhill wore on us. By the time we reached the creek Big E said everything below his waist was hurting. My feet were feeling the pounding as well. So after filling our bottles we soaked our feet in the icy water. A couple and a father and daughter were camping nearby, just tooling around the area. The soaking really helped our sore feet. We decided to press on another mile and a half to Gooch Mountain Shelter.
Dinner at Gooch Mountain shelter was ramen with tuna and a side of jerky. Protein is critical. A Massachusetts couple here are working on finishing sectioning the AT, which they started 24 years ago. A thirty-something Louisianan with a long beard with a white streak is thinking of heading to Maine, if it's open when he gets there. There's also a couple from California hiking as far as they can get. The girl was furloughed from state government until at least October. She had a bad review of the Duplex tent I just bought. Said she took a bath in it when it rained one night and returned it. Hopefully I got a working one!
Storms still haven't rolled in by 9. But we are both exhausted. We'll decide in the morning if we're hiking another 15 miles to Neel Gap.","Springer Mountain shelter
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Jun 04, Thu",15.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628397,"It was a dark and stormy night... But we slept like babies. Two days hard hiking will do that! Rain was petering out in the morning and we woke up gung-ho to get to Neel Gap. 
Minutes after leaving Gooch shelter the skies opened up and poured steadily as we descended to Gooch Gap. We donned ponchos to keep the worst off us and our packs. Our spirits remained high, knowing we were headed to town after Neel Gap, and enjoying the cooler air. But as the rain continued I grew less confident we'd make the nearly 16 miles, including a difficult climb and descent over Blood Mountain, highest in Georgia. It'd taken us 11 hours to do similar mileage in clear weather yesterday. On a whim I checked the AWOL guide and saw a general store/hostel listed for Suches, a tiny spot undeserving of the title ""village"", but only two miles off trail from Woody Gap ahead. Thankfully having service I called and was curtly told the hostel was closed. The lady somewhat reluctantly gave me the number of something called Above the Clouds hostel. Guthook did indeed list it and with great reviews of wonderful beds and meals as recently as yesterday. (Guthook is an online app with trail landmarks and services, AWOL is a paper guide updated each December). Lucky picked up the phone when I called and quickly agreed to pick us up at Woody Gap. 
Our sights now set on a short day to rest up, we enjoyed the last few miles. On Ramrock mountain we watched rain clouds settle among the rolling mountains. We passed the peak I'd spent a lovely night on two years ago with sunset and sunrise views, now shrouded in leaves and fog. Stopping for a breather we found a snail stretching out of its shell and ""rainbathing"" on a rock. In the last quarter mile we came to a spring turned waterfall cascading over the trail. Our water bottles still practically useless, I drank copiously from the falling water with my hands and Big E did likewise. It was rainwater flowing off the top of the mountain just yards above us, safer even than tap water. Although it wasn't a thirsty kind of hiking, being able to drink effortlessly was pure happiness. 
At Woody Gap a paved highway crossed the trail with trash cans, restrooms, and numerous cars with sightseers. Nimrod, a sharp-nosed, full white-bearded multiple thruhiker, drove up within minutes of my text announcing our arrival. He took us down to the hostel on a 13 acre tract with a brick bungalow and a large white block abandoned storefront. Above the Clouds just opened March 1, enjoyed immediate success, but had to close 18 days later due to trailhead closures driving away business. When hikers started calling again a few weeks ago they reopened. Lucky, the owner, bought it from a 100-year-old member of the Gooch family. His neighbors are the Woodys, descendants of Georgia""s first national forest superintendent who acquired much of the Chattahoochee national forest and built the dirt track that later became Highway 60.  My shuttle driver Bret ""Suches"" Eady lives nearby and according to Lucky is part of the family that founded the town. Suches is Cherokee for ""Above the Clouds"". It sits at the intersection with a mountain road that becomes forest service road 42, winding past every gap from here back to Springer itself. Lucky says they can slackpack hikers all the way across Georgia.
Big E and I dried out, showered, did laundry, and eventually downed a frozen pizza. But mostly we relaxed and shot the breeze with our hosts. Later in the afternoon a young section hiker from Augusta who doesn't like his trail name stopped in to clean up before heading home. Then Lucky brought in four hikers from Gooch Gap. The same guys who were zeroing at Hawk Mountain yesterday. They are UNC students, mostly in art and music, heading for Franklin, NC on their first extended backpacking trip. With 50 pound packs they are eager to lighten up. One is named Squatch after his yeti ankle tattoo. Another is Yellow Eagle after his own tattoo. 
Lucky drove us the half mile to the general store, giving us the grand twenty second tour of town. A twisty road out of town is sought after by motorcyclists much like the Dragon's Tail in North Carolina. The bikers congregate at a tenting ground in Suches on weekends. Lucky plans to turn his abandoned storefront into a cafe to get some of that business. It was once the area's only store for nearly a century. 
With ice teas, ice cream, and breakfast pastries we headed back. They had to wait though, as shrimp jambalaya was put out for dinner. Mmm, excellent! The four college guys couldn't finish the leftovers so Big E and I cleaned out the bowl. 
Big E volunteered to do dishes to save $5 on our stay. His first taste of work-for-stay! Very proud of him. We all retired to the living room for conversation. Lucky is a champion poker player and had plenty of advice for aspiring players. Then Nimrod came in to regale us with stories of the AT as it was during his 1980 thruhike. In one he was dragged out of a hostel in Maine by the owner Old Man Shaw at 3 in the morning to help him dress a moose. A moose he'd taken out with his 3/4 ton pickup! Or night-hiking Mt Madison in the Whites when a surprise gale blew in frigid air and dumped 6 inches of rain on him as he huddled in the boulders!
The four college guys were hanging on every word, as Nimrod and I explained many of the cultural oddities of the trail and places not to miss. The Doyle, the Whites, the half gallon challenge, Grandma Gatewood, the four state challenge, the 24/24/24 challenge, which hostels to visit and those to avoid (*cough* Garden Mountain *cough*). Laughing Heart hostel in Hot Springs was once a Jesuit monastery. Explains all the cell-like rooms! I learned a lot of trail history myself. The old AT of solitary wilderness sojourns has passed into history. But guys like Nimrod remain to remind us of that time.","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Woody Gap / Above the Clouds Hostel,"Jun 05, Fri",4.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628411,"It was chilly in the hostel overnight with fans going full blast. I know, such problems. Breakfast was Lucky's grandma's recipe for biscuits and gravy. Delicious!
Yesterday I cleaned out the water filters thoroughly. What a pleasure not to have to fight for every drop. Now we just need a dirty water bag that doesn't leak.
The UNC foursome decided to yellow blaze and get back on at Woody Gap. So we all caravaned the three minutes up to the Gap and took off. It was a beautiful Saturday morning and the large lot was full. 
Great views at Preaching Rock a short ways in. Lots and lots of dayhikers and weekend backpackers on trail. Some ask me where I'm headed. When I say Maine they ask when I'll be done. That's determined by climate. Katahdin will close sometime in mid October when the snow hits. But that's over four months away.
Big E and I were in great spirits after a satisfying breakfast. We weren't hungry again for hours. We passed over numerous small climbs, shallow gaps, and sidehill trail. There were some views to ridges in the south. Humidity came and went like drifting fog.At Jarrard Gap we began a 1200 foot climb to Blood Mountain, the highest point on the Georgia AT. Filling up at a spring on the way up we ran into the amateur radio enthusiasts from Springer. Still chugging along, this was their last day and they still seemed a little overwhelmed. 
The climb up wasn't as hard as Big E imagined. Blooming rhododendrons and mountain laurel lined the trail above 4000 feet. Near the summit the trail turned to bedrock.
A large backpacking Hispanic family or group was at the top. One woman took our picture. There's a stone two-room shelter with fireplace built in the 1930s. Big E was proud to have conquered the mountain. The sun was out but a breeze kept us cool. 
The descent was more precarious,  with long stretches of angled, sometimes damp, bedrock and lots of rock hopping. A series of granite clearings exposed long views across blue mountains with rhododendrons, mountain laurel, and wildflowers encircling us. We descended steadily, visions of pizza pulling us toward Neel Gap.
On the way down we passed many dayhikers and a few backpackers. We smiled and greeted them all. Some were too tired to reciprocate. One out-of-shape dad with a large pack mumbled ""I'm in too much pain"" when we commented on the gorgeous weather and ""This isn't my thing."" That might be true, but I admire him making the effort with his young son in tow.
We passed Balancing Rock, a formation of wind and water erosion that appears to be one boulder resting precariously on another. But they are still connected in two spots. It must be a similar process as that carving the natural arches out west. We pushed and pushed, but it's pretty solid!
When we reached the Mountain Crossings outfitter in the old stone Walasi-Yi Center at Neel Gap we were all business. Frozen pizzas went in the oven. We purchased cold drinks, resupply for the next two days, and a new Evernew water bag to replace the leaky Sawyer bags. Stamped the AT passport. Picked up the sleeping bag liner I ordered last week. It's a silk liner, great for summer nights when a bag is too hot, or cooler nights to supplement a summer bag that isn't warm enough. Plus it feels better on the skin and keeps the bag cleaner.
I asked the clerk, a young bearded hiker type, whether any thruhikers had come by. He dismissed the idea saying it was too late and they'd have to flip up to Maine to finish. Told him I wasn't gonna flip. He agreed straight nobo was the way to go, but seemed doubtful it would happen. 
Big E and I each finished off a 12"" pizza. Then some leftover brownies from Above the Clouds. We had skipped lunch and gone since breakfast splitting a honey bun and a granola bar. This late lunch / early dinner was enough for the day though.
Big E was feeling tired so we hung out awhile and admired the spreading oak covered with the discarded boots of failed thruhikers. The radio boys showed up, as did the Hispanic family. A troop of boy scouts headed out beginning a 44 mile hike to Deep Gap, North Carolina. We'll see more of them. No sign of the UNC foursome from the hostel. A woman eagerly told us how the outfitter had shaken 20 pounds out of her 55 pound pack. She still sported a huge external frame pack, 5 gallon sleeping bag, and fishing rod. She was headed as far as she could get in two months.
On his way out after closing the store the hiker-clerk guy stopped by and offered us a pack of tortillas. Trail magic! It's not actually our first. In the bear box at Black Gap shelter our first day we found someone had left Taco Bell fire sauce. To Big E, that's trail magic!
A dayhiker chatted me up as we were packing. His wife and daughter were late picking him up and he thought they may have taken a wrong turn on their hike back to the car. He had no service so tried to reach them with my phone to no avail. Told him I'd keep trying but we had to go. An hour later his wife texted back and somehow I managed to connect them. He had hitched back to their parking spot and the girls eventually found him. 
Big E and I meanwhile had hiked north less than half a mile and found a large tenting spot. Our first night tenting, and it was perfect weather. He retired early to watch a downloaded movie while I reclined on a fortuitously shaped rock and enjoyed the evening breeze. The bear bag was hung, we were too full to cook, and it's time to sleep.","Woody Gap / Above the Clouds Hostel
",Stealth spot past Neel Gap,"Jun 06, Sat",11.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628426,"We broke camp this beautiful morning while water boiled for oatmeal. Nice and cool and lower humidity. Surrounded by green and a view of blue mountains in the distance. We planned on a ten mile day to Low Gap.
A few minutes in we ran across Virginia breaking camp, the woman who got a pack shakedown yesterday. She immediately asked my opinion of her habit of carving crosses into trees. I told her it was definitely not Leave No Trace, and that it encouraged others to do the same. I can only imagine she knew this was a bad idea but wanted someone's blessing. Said she would call the forest service to get their advice. I'm pretty sure I know how that conversation would go. 
Up past Bull Gap was Boy Scout troop 61 from Tampa. About ten boys and five leaders. They backpack a section of the AT in Georgia or North Carolina every June. This year it's a 50 mile section from Neel Gap to Deep Gap in North Carolina. Some of the boys were using a collapsible saw to clear out deadfall from the trail. 
A mile north three trail maintainers passed us carrying a large handsaw intending to attack the same deadfall. They were thrilled to hear most of their work was already done.
The ups and downs were pleasant and most had views of the hazy mountains as clouds lifted late in the morning. But they started to wear us down. Levelland Mountain, Rock Spring Top, Wolf Laurel Top, Green Cliff Top, Cowrock Mountain, Wildcat Mountain, Strawberry Top, Poor Mountain, and Sheep Rock Top. A lot of mountains for what was supposed to be an easier day after Blood Mountain!
After Tesnatee Gap we climbed to a spot called Lunch Rock overlooking the valley and ate our salami and cheese on flatbread. But we foolishly let our water run low and had to scoop from a low flowing trickle down at Hogpen Gap.
The last four miles were easy dirt trail but constant up and down. Sheep Rock Top had us ready to end our day at Low Gap. There we found a dayhiker prepping for a thruhike next year. Another guy, a young ex-Marine, came in to set up his hammock. He's out for a couple weeks. Had planned to thruhike starting April 1 but will try for next year. Trail name is Trail Arms for working his trekking poles so hard.
The Mexican family stopped in for water and to splash around in the stream. I liked the idea and took a hiker shower by wetting my little towel and washing my arms and legs.
One guy shared the large shelter with us. A Bostonian turned Austin resident. Took up hiking a few years ago and thrued the Colorado Trail last year. Now just going as far as he pleases.
Pleasant evening. Can hear the stream gurgling nearby. Calling for scattered showers in the morning.","Stealth spot past Neel Gap
",Low Gap Shelter,"Jun 07, Sun",11
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628439,"Low Gap shelter was shrouded in mist as dawn broke. I lay in the shelter messing with my phone's manual camera settings trying to capture it. Photography is not my gift, or at least not my phone's.
Gear was a bit damp. Socks, towels, shirts that were left out in a vain attempt to dry had if anything absorbed more water. Such is summer on the AT.Our sheltermate David, the sixtyish Colorado Trail hiker was very talkative as he'd been all last evening. Trail Arms calls him Sheldon after the Big Bang Theory character. 
Boy scouts started appearing to fetch water. Big E and I downed a cold breakfast of donuts - don't tell his mom! - so we could leave early for Unicoi Gap. He has a plane to catch for home this evening. I'll be continuing on without my hiking partner.
Big E has saved us from going off trail at least three times this week. I seem to ignore the blazes and go with the path that looks most traveled. Don't know how I'm going to find my way to Maine without him!
We were first out, shortly after 7. Miles of mostly dirt sidehill trail wound around knobs with imposingly steep dropoffs to one side. Numerous springs or runoff trickled over bare bedrock onto the trail from the steep slopes above. Pure enough to put out your hands and drink from. Sometimes we were engulfed in tunnels of mountain laurel.
We passed numerous tent sites, one of which held the large Mexican family. They have come a remarkable distance over the last few days, considering the number of kids in the group, and that all their equipment is heavy and designed for car camping. I wouldn't want to carry the packs some of the women were carrying.
The early morning fog gradually lifted, though it remained humid and overcast. The forecasted scattered showers manifested as barely perceptible drizzle. We actually wished for more to cool us down.
We ended a tough rocky and rooty climb up to Blue Mountain with a well-deserved break. It was here I met my trail family last March when I was hiking to Damascus. It was already dark and pouring, the shelter was overfull, and I had to set up my tent in the downpour. But the shelter had a large overhang for cooking and socializing and the company was great. 
Continuing up Blue Mountain, we heard the ovenbirds were out in force again. They've dominated the forest conversation in Georgia. A strong breeze blew through. Traffic sounds from Unicoi Gap reached out ears.
It was over 1000 feet down to the gap over unusually rocky trail. We reached the gap about noon. All morning we'd seen only two other hikers, both dayhikers. But at the gap were Sheldon and Trail Arms, both of whom passed us during our shelter break, and a thruhiker named Jammin'. He was headed into Helen to rest his feet which he thought were prone to injury after the last few days. There were also a dozen trucks belonging to dayhikers who were off in the mountains.
The highway was poorly arranged for hitching to the south, where we needed to pick up a rental car near Helen to get Big E to the airport. So I called and texted around looking for a shuttler nearby. The closest was over an hour away. So we waited. Jammin' started talking thruhike logistics and said we'd certainly have to flip up to Maine at some point to finish in time. Nothing doing, I told him. It's continuous footsteps to Katahdin for me. I had enough of flippin' and floppin' as a section hiker.
Jammin' was going to share our ride but got impatient and approached a grizzled guy in an old pickup. A minute late he and his pack were in the open back of the truck heading south on the highway. If I hadn't already arranged the shuttle we probably would have joined him.
Splitter, our driver, eventually showed up and took us down to Enterprise in Cleveland. He thrued in 2015, and worked at Mountain Crossings for years. He trail runs the local AT as often as he can, often daily between shuttles. He used to run up and down Blood Mountain everyday trying to break his record. Recalling the rocky descent I winced at the thought of what a wrong step would do.
Big E and I drove up to Helen for a celebratory Mexican lunch. An enormous amount of food even two famished hikers couldn't finish! It was the first time either of us had eaten in a restaurant in almost three months. Helen is a kitschy town full of faux German architecture. The main attraction seems to be river tubing. But there are so many hotels and restaurants it seems to have developed as a popular destination in and of itself. Even on a Monday lots of people were about shopping, eating, and tubing. It was an ordinary summer day. 
We drove two hours to the Atlanta airport, stopping at Walmart for a duffel to hold his backpack, poles, and other items that would need to be checked. Since Big E is still a minor I was able to escort him all the way to the gate and see him off. Another ordinary event that is now rare in our safety-crazed world. He landed safely in Pennsylvania before I even got back to Helen. 
On Jammin's advice I got the hiker special at the Best Western. More than half off the going rate is pretty nice. If it weren't already 10:30 I might have taken a dip in the pool. Tomorrow I need to resupply, return the rental, and get back to business. Katahdin will not come to me. I must go to Katahdin.","Low Gap Shelter
",Unicoi Gap / Helen,"Jun 08, Mon",9.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628505,"Driving back from the airport last night after seeing off my son, it hit me that I am now on my own. There are 2100 miles ahead. It was a sobering and lonely thought. I already miss my hiking partner.
I ate the Mexican leftovers for breakfast. I didn't think I was hungry, and it didn't look appetizing, but it happened. Lots of protein, can't hurt!
Toured Helen, with ""Alpine"" German-style architecture. Although midweek in early June the shops were already becoming busy. There are three jerky shops. Can't imagine there is this much demand for crocodile, ostrich, and python jerky. Okay, I bought a few. It's a change from Slim Jims. A different wild animal every day for a week.
There's a dutch-style windmill at the edge of town. All gingerbread siding, the works. A UHaul truck seems to be stored in front of it. Kind of sums up the vibe.
Next door is Hofer's Konditorei (bakery), where I just randomly pointed at things and took it to go. It will taste good on the trail. 
Resupplied at the Ingles supermarket. I sent the stove home with Big E to save weight. I'm going to try cold soaking rice and maybe coos-coos. Bought so many snacks to make sure I got the calories I'm not sure I'm saving weight. But it will taste better than watery noodles and potatoes every night.
A shuttler named Michelle took me back to Unicoi Gap.  She hasn't done a lot of hiking but knows the community. Her first year shuttling full-time has been a bit of a roller coaster. Constantly busy in early March. The last thruhiker she took was an Aussie going to the airport to return home fearing the border would close.
From Unicoi there was a lot of climbing. 1000 feet up, back down, 1300 feet up, back down. Then numerous smaller hills. Humid but relatively cool at elevation. Some nice views of ridges receding in the clouds. Often breezy. Thunder rumbled in the distance occasionally.
I filled my water bottle this morning with melted ice from the motel ice machine. Not sure why I thought it would be purer or taste better. Probably neither! But I also packed out a bag full of iced tea. That was a thirst quencher for me.
I accidentally turned onto the trail into Tray Mountain Shelter. Lounging there were the four UNC guys. Some of them looked a little beat, but all seemed happy to be out. They expect to complete the whole of Georgia. Pretty good for their first trip.
I said goodbye and walked past the shelter, down the trail past other tenters and down the hill until it dead-ended at a trickle of water. Ack! This wasn't the AT!  So I sheepishly marched back up and said my goodbyes again as I exited the shelter side trail. Troop 61 was arriving. One of the boys was surprised to see me here and called me Obi Wan. I guess it's the white hair. Another trail name if I want it.
I didn't get on trail until 2. It was now 5 but I'd only come 6 miles. Won't get to Maine in time if I stop here. So Ipushed on 7.5 miles to the next shelter. More ups and downs. After leaving the UNC guys and the troop I knew I wouldn't see them again. That feeling of being on my own came up again. This late in the season, I'm unlikely to see the same group of hikers for long.
The wind picked up, thunder drew closer. I pulled out my poncho before the heavy rain hit. It poured down for the next hour and a half as I climbed more mountains. The trail became a stream. My shoes and socks were quickly soaked. Grimly I trudged on. There will be plenty of days like this, I told myself. Find the good in them, don't focus on the bad.
Kelly Knob was particularly frustrating. Only an 800 foot climb, it seemed far longer than the earlier, bigger climbs. After forever I crested the ridge with, of course, no views. And then a long, long descent. Finally the shelter side trail appeared, and even that was long. 
At the shelter were a couple heading for Franklin and a 28-year-old woman named Backtrack attempting to thruhike. She's been wanting to do this for ten years and planning it for two. She meant to start two months ago. Doesn't want to flip up to Maine, but not sure she can finish otherwise. 
There was a sleeping loft and I spread out my stuff, knowing nothing will dry. I ate all the pastries from Hofer's for dinner. The giant Bavarian soft pretzel had been a trail snack. Not the healthiest diet today. But I did buy fruit for breakfast tomorrow. We'll see how it held up.
Rain is still bouncing off the shelter roof. Supposed to be wet the next two days. I should get to Franklin by then. I already stink after just a couple of hours of being damp.","Unicoi Gap / Helen
",Deep Gap Shelter,"Jun 09, Tue",13.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628507,"Heavy showers battered the shelter in the morning. I didn't get up until 9, waiting it out.
Had my first fruit I ever packed out for breakfast, a Georgia peach. Not fantastic, guess it needed a couple more days to ripen and bruise in the pack. Also a breakfast bar since I am now stoveless, so no oatmeal.
Crazy Eyes is the male half of the young couple at the shelter. He's going for several more weeks. His girlfriend will leave at Franklin to take a job at Domino's. But is looking forward to an Ozarks trip.
The pack felt too light leaving the shelter. What am I forgetting? I dropped 4 pounds of iced tea, water, and pastries. It felt very nice until the first big climb.
Minutes up the trail I ran into Mr. Clean and Tenderfoot, hammockers who got an early start from the previous shelter. They've section hiked the AT from Bennington, Vermont to Pearisburg, Virginia mostly on long weekends. Georgia was to be a special trip with Mr Clean's college graduating daughter but she bailed out. They plan to eventually do every section. Last night they had storms with 20-30 mile per hour winds. Mr Clean's hammock tarp failed, his quilt and gear were soaked. He reminded me that I'd complemented him on the ""nice hang"" as I walked by them last evening without mentioning a storm was coming. Life lessons I guess.
All day it rained on and off. Sometimes the wind would pick up as if bringing in a new shower. It would knock drops off the leaves and took a bit to see that it would do no more. The sun tried to peek out a couple times early on but gave up. All in all just a wet day to hike.
Lunch was at Plumorchard Gap Shelter. I might not have turned off if I knew it was so far downhill. It's a deceptively large three-story shelter - a shelf over the main platform plus a loft in the front overhang. A sign implies it was helicoptered in wholly built by the Army 5th Ranger Training Battalion. 
Gave my feet a chance to dry while eating. This helps prevent blisters and chafing. Lunch was mesquite pork rinds. Hey, they have a lot of protein, carbs, and salt. Perfect trail food. I had my fruit today!
The afternoon was still miserable weather wise. For the first time I put in earbuds and listened to an audio book to distract me from the long climb up to North Carolina. ""I'm a Stranger Here Myself"", a collection of Bill Bryson columns for a British paper on his return to America. I enjoy some of his books but these were mostly a collection of complaints about American habits. Still it passed the time. The only hikers I saw after leaving Mr. Clean and Tenderfoot at the highway at Dicks Creek Gap were two backpackers going south to the road. Went many hours without seeing another soul.
I walked into North Carolina around 4 and went straight up Courthouse Bald to the highest elevation yet, over 4700 feet, but of course no views today with the rain and fog. Took another break at Muskrat Creek Shelter then tackled the last five miles. Should have aired out the feet again. Felt hot spots forming on the heels. At Deep Gap a threesome was car camping behind a ""No Camping"" sign. Their campfire sent smoke mingling with the fog. I was happy to climb above it. 
Finally reached Standing Indian Shelter close to 8. David (Sheldon) was there along with a thruhiker named Sunrise who started June 5th. He also plans to go straight to Katahdin. Having hiked the PCT last year he's already doing twenty mile days so I will likely see more of him.
Had a good dinner of off-the-bone ham and blueberry cobbler cheddar. Supermarket paid off. Wind is still blowing and knocking drops on the shelter. Tomorrow I'm shooting to reach Franklin and dry out.","Deep Gap Shelter
",Standing Indian Shelter,"Jun 10, Wed",20.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628518,"Storm showers again battered the shelter overnight with a chill wind often whipping through at our almost 5000 foot elevation. Glad there was a huge overhang.  But nothing would be drying overnight. By first light, however, the sky was clear and promised a bluebird day.
My sheltermate Sunrise, a red-bearded prospective thruhiker from Portland, Oregon, started June 5th. He hadn't stopped in town or resupplied yet so both of us had our sights set on the town of Franklin, twenty miles away. The third shelter-dweller, David, had over fifteen days of food and no interest in going to town or hiking twenty miles.  
So Sunrise and I set off in lockstep, chatting away the morning, putting down miles on easy grades over Standing Indian mountain. We crossed paths with a number of backpacking groups doing a 24-mile loop trail. Some were smiling, others grimacing beneath 40-50 pound packs. Spots of sun mingled with cool breezes and only occasional patches of humidity. Gradually the trail and our clothes began to dry. A perfect day for hiking.
A tough, steep, rocky, but mercifully short climb brought us to the peak of Albert Mountain. There a firetower gave us sweeping views of mountains extending to the horizon in every direction. I still swear I can see the Smokies from there. We crossed 5000 feet for the first time on both Albert and Standing Indian.
With cell service at last on Albert we arranged a pickup from Gooder Grove Hostel in Franklin. We figured we'd make Rock Gap, the pickup point, by 4. Zen the owner figured we'd beat that by at least an hour and promised to be there at 2:45. With six miles to go we weren't so sure. But we booked downhill for the gap anyway. Made very good time. Sunshine is a little faster on both uphill and down. Might be related to his 6' 4"" stature, or maybe those 2600 miles he hiked last year! 
We ended up at Rock Gap minutes before our original ETA of 4 o' clock. Fortunately Zen arrived minutes later by pure coincidence. He had rescued an injured thruhiker from Deep Gap, just before Standing Indian. It turned out to be the girl Backtrack. She woke up with a swollen knee and had hobbled eleven miles to the next forest service road. 
Once situated at the hostel, showered, laundry in, and having met the trio of dogs that run the place - Josie, Willow, and a 14-year-old white dog - we headed to Main St. The outfitter Outdoor 76 had just closed a minute ago at 6, but opened up for us anyway for Sunshine to check out sleeping bag liners and buy an inflatable pillow. With few extra clothes in summer he didn't have enough to stuff a sack for a decent pillow anymore. I have a similar issue but all it needs to do is support my neck which it does pretty well. My inflatable pad does the rest.
Milkshakes followed at Motor Company grill, home of the 4-pound Eldorado hiker burger. It seemed forbidding, but the server said 20 of the 40 who requested it last year finished it. Neither of us was hungry enough, having hit Wendy's on the way into town. Sunshine turned out to be the faster and more voracious eater. He's twenty-five with a strong build. Probably needs about a third more calories than me. 
A beer on the patio of the Lazy Hiker Brewing Company in the comfortable evening air gave us time to catch up with pictures and journaling. Walked over to resupply at Ingles. Probably a mistake but I got Slimfast powder to make breakfast shakes with lots of protein. It can only exceed my expectations. 
The owner of the food truck next to the brewpub gave us a ride back to the hostel in the back of his pickup truck. There we found Crazy Eyes and girlfriend Cinco, who I stayed at a shelter with a couple nights ago, watching The Last Airbender anime and finishing off Italian takeout. They're planning a few days off. The dogs came around for lots of affection. 
With laundry and everything else now dry, tomorrow is looking good to get back in the mountains and pound out some footsteps to Maine.","Standing Indian Shelter
",Rock Gap / Franklin,"Jun 11, Thu",19.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628549,"Woke up in town on a beautiful day for hiking, but didn't reach the trail until 2. Had a big omelette and biscuits and gravy at Kountry Kitchen, next to a rough-looking, abandoned place called the Roadhouse that looked like you'd find Patrick Swayze inside.
Sunshine had a package due at the post office - his summer sleeping bag. But it was still on the truck. Rather than risk greater delays by bouncing it ahead he decided to wait a few hours, so I joined him to save Zen having to make two twenty-mile round trip shuttles. Several more hours in town - a trial I must endure!
So what does one do with a couple of hours to kill in Franklin, North Carolina? Why, go look at kilts, of course! Franklin is the home of the only museum in the world outside Scotland on Scottish Tartans, the plaid patterns each clan wore. These are largely a modern invention. Two centuries ago only 100 were catalogued. Now there are many thousands as families, organizations, towns like Franklin, and even businesses have created their own. My own family has a Cunningham on my mother's mother's side. We looked up the pattern. Red with black stripes. Could have been a lumberjack shirt! My grandmother herself was a McGovern, who apparently come from Ulster, now part of the UK. Although Irish, they too had a tartan. A sample was dug up from a farm in the 50s. Faded to browns, weavers recreated what it must have looked like new. The museum also featured Scottish history from prehistoric to union with England, Royal Highlander regimental uniforms and medals and more. So much of western North Carolina seems to have been founded and named for Scots.
Our hostel host and shuttle driver Zen took us back to the trail around 2 after a successful package interception. Zen is deep into Eastern mysticism, and former editor of the Macon County News. He has a good heart, loves dogs, and wishes he could get back to the trail himself. Like most hostel owners, his is a labor of love. It is hard to find good help to be able to step away.
The hiking was strenuous at times but enjoyable. Cool dry breezes and clear blue skies outside the green tunnel made for a perfect day. I notice more rocks and roots than in Georgia. Not predominant, just more frequent, especially near water sources and on sidehill trail. Late in the day I began tripping in roots and could tell I needed to stop soon.
Minutes after starting I was captivated by a spring with a waterfall and, after snapping a picture, dropped my phone in the drink. The home screen shone through the rushing water. Quickly retrieving it, I turned it off and let it dry out for a few hours in my pocket. Fortunately it booted up later in the evening. All my maps among much else are on it. Probably a warning not to rely on it so much. It was interesting hiking all afternoon without knowing exactly where I was or what time it was. Liberating, a little.
Had fantastic 360 degree views from Siler Bald and Wayah Bald. Wayah we reached not long before sunset and watched the orange ridges in the west, the multi-hued blues in the east, and the pink tints to the clouds. The Smokies were visible to the north, only 27 miles by crow but 80 by trail. A large family from Orlando came in from the parking lot to see the sunset. They had lots of questions for the thruhikers.
It was only a mile to the shelter but we opted to camp up here. Forecast was clear but cold. Low of 55 in Franklin 3000 feet below meant 45 at our 5300 ft elevation. I cowboy camped (no tent) on the leeward side of the stone tower that was formerly a firetower to minimize the chill breeze. The stars gradually came out in a perfectly clear night sky, twinkling near the edges. So perfectly clear. And so many! One airplane passed high above. Then a tiny dot moved deliberately westward. Not a shooting star. Not a plane. It could only have been a satellite, or perhaps the space station. I've never seen such a thing before. 
After dozing the cold breeze on my face woke me up. The sky was now ablaze with the Milky Way, flowing northwest to southeast. Stars that had been pinpricks were now like bonfires, and thousands more around them. Another nap and now the quarter moon was rising in the east with clouds moving in. I felt like a time traveler watching the universe change before my eyes.
I'll leave you with this quote from William Bartram, an explorer and botanist whose route through this region in the mid 1770s is now the Bartram Trail, on the view from Wayah Bald:
""I beheld with rapture and astonishment a sublimely awful scene of power and magnificence, a world of mountains piled upon mountains.""","Rock Gap / Franklin
",Wayah Bald,"Jun 12, Fri",13.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628567,"It was a cold and windy night cowboy camping on Wayah Bald and I spent most of it tightly wrapped in every layer in my pack. But the night sky made it worth it. I awoke before dawn to voices visiting the tower. They left, I quickly changed and started packing up, when a plump local couple came up to the tower loaded with camera equipment. The wife slipped on a stone paver just as she saw me and fell cartoonishly on her ample behind. I felt bad for her and apologized if I surprised her. They set up tripods to record the sunrise over the mountains. Despite cloud cover in the east the colors of the ridgelines were spectacular. The sun's rays pierced through the clouds and illuminated the hills. Magical.
Broke camp and headed down the trail around 6:45. I thought I was making good time, but still stuck around 2.4 mph, consistent with last few days. It warmed up but the weather remained dry and comfortable.
Six miles in I dropped my pack at Cold Springs Shelter and went to find the privy. Couldn't find it so I had to use plan B. Meanwhile I heard a big thump down at the shelter, a couple hundred yards out of sight. Oh, great, did a bear find my pack? Visions of all my worldly possessions flung down the hill in a search for food flashed through my head. But it was only David, the Colorado Trail hiker, dumping his own pack. Another hiker, Old School, a 64-year-old triathlete, also showed up. He's been hiking the trail since the 70s and knows this spot well.
As I approached Tellico Gap a few miles later two cyclists were walking their mountain bikes up the trail. The AT only permits foot traffic. It's famous for that. The PCT and many others allow horses, bikes, even motorized vehicles in places. But not anywhere on the AT. I don't want to be the AT trail ethics police, but I know how bikes damage other trails I've used. I ask them if they know this is the AT. Sure, they say. You know it's only for hikers? We are hiking!, they say, with a wink. I'm not amused. One asks ""What does it look like we're doing?"". I have a few answers for that, but I leave them with ""It looks like you're biking on the Appalachian Trail, sir."" I'm not the trail police, but they don't get my blessing for being jerks. As I descend I warned a family of dayhikers of the bikers uphill. God forbid they come roaring down this steep single track and hurt someone.
Up at Wesser Bald there's another firetower and great circular views. A large group of friends are dayhiking and I snap their picture. Three amateur radio buffs have set up strange antennae. With 10 watt transmitters, their signals bounce off the ionosphere, allowing for direct radio communication around the world. One guy with a 5 watt rig yells out ""Can you believe this? Czech Republic!"" 
On the long 3400 foot downhill from Wesser Bald to the Nantahala River I finished listening to Bryson's ""I'm a Stranger Here Myself"". He has some perennial and somewhat cliched observations of American quirks (the columns are from the late 90s), but he overstates the case too often for comic effect or due to his own biases. He also plays to his British audience's assumptions about Americans. Not as good as some of his other works, including ""A Walk in the Woods"" about his AT hike.
The Nantahala River is at the bottom of this 3000-foot deep gap. In fact Nantahala is Cherokee for ""land of the noonday sun,"" where gaps and hollows as so steep the sun only reaches them for a few hours.
I made it down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) around 2:30. Sunrise was resting at a picnic table among the throngs and I met another thruhiker named Wanderer from Missouri who started after Memorial Day. I loaded up on calories in the form of a burger and mac 'n cheese. The NOC and the Nantahala river were bustling with hundreds of tourists, kayakers, and rafters. Very sunny and warm. I submerged myself in the cool river before packing up to tackle the long climb out of the gap. Just then David walked through, didn't hear us, and wandered off to a cabin for the night. 
A long 3000 foot seven mile climb took the next several hours. I listened to the book ""Grandma Gatewood's Walk"", about the 67-year-old who in 1955 became the first solo woman to thruhike, starting out with no tent, no sleeping bag, dungarees, a homemade twelve-pound sack she slung over her shoulder, and a pair of Keds. She told her eleven grown children she was going out to ""take a walk"" but not that it would be five months!
The climb was not as tough as I feared, and the climate was still pleasant. I still had energy when I reached Sassafras Gap Shelter. Sunrise was eating dinner, along with a weekend sectioner named Thor and his dog Warren. Thor just needs the Smokies to complete the first 900 miles of the trail, which he started 20 years ago in his youth. He was reserved so the conversation waned. I exploded my pack and set out making a ham and cheddar wrap with mustard, salt, and pepper packets gathered from various restaurants.
No bearbox or cables here. Sunshine left his hang kit at Wayah Bald. So I hoisted both bags on my line. Don't think it's ever had that much weight, so crossing my fingers. It was a model PCT hang from a difficult Y-branch if I do say so myself. A girl tenting behind the shelter made an appearance only to tie her bear bag to a tree on the ground. ""It's an Ursack"" she explained, obviously not realizing that not only can a bear tear through that reinforced fabric, but even a mouse can gnaw through it.
It was chilly again as I rotisseried on my pad and eventually drifted off in the shelter.","Wayah Bald
",Sassafras Gap Shelter,"Jun 13, Sat",24.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628568,"Up at bird o' clock, as David would say. The rising sun pointed directly at Sassafras Gap Shelter but the trees filtered the warm rays. 
Had a notion at the Franklin resupply the other day I should make protein shakes for breakfast, since I am now stoveless, so I picked up Slimfast powder. It has lots of protein and fiber for the weight. The taste and texture, unfortunately, is what you'd expect mixing cocoa powder in cold water. Only eleven more servings to go! <shudder>
We extended a long day by hiking out of the NOC yesterday so today we could shoot for Fontana Dam at the foot of the Smokies. I started out with lots of energy. The pack felt nice and light - until I started climbing.
Nice views up at Cheoah Bald, today's high point at 5100 feet. Has a perfect tenting spot for future reference. By now we are practically spoiled for views.
Good weather and mild temperatures in the green tunnel. Sunshine hiked well ahead of me all morning. Sometimes we leapfrog when he stops to filter water. I just fill my smartwater bottle and screw on the Sawyer filter. Takes less than a minute. It filters as I drink and gets me back on trail faster. But Sunshine always passes me eventually.
At the highway in Stecoah Gap an extended family was visiting partly to celebrate their newly-minted Georgia Tech grad. I took their picture after several minutes of herding cats. Resting at a picnic table was a woman finishing a weekend section hike. She gets out as often as she can from Friday evening to Sunday to piece together parts of North Carolina. A pair of cyclists stood nearby resting their backsides from biking up to the 3100 foot Gap from Cherokee, many miles to the west. They're training for a circuit of Washington State that will include heights like Mt Rainier and the North Cascades. 
Sunshine disappeared to find a spring that was marked as being nearby. When he returned he had a broken trekking pole from slipping to get down a steep slope to the water. Carbon fiber poles don't bend, they snap. It was Sunday, so a call to order a replacement segment would have to wait.
It was blue skies all morning, but after 1 the sky darkened and wind picked up. Sure enough a shower came through as I chugged along the Cheoah Mountains. I threw on my dollar-store poncho - a more effective way to keep me and my pack dry than any raincoat or pack cover. It ""breathes"" much better.
Stopped for water at a beautiful little fall in the side of the mountain. The shower had long passed so I doffed the poncho. Sure enough, a minute later a new shower began, lightly at first. Pulled out the poncho again.
I ducked into Cable Gap Shelter to wait out the shower as it intensified. Sunshine and a crowd of five had the same idea. Among them Sockbrush, Mamma Africa, Aboo-ee, and Crackin'. Sockbrush, a guy out for a month or so with no destination, lost his toothbrush and started using his sock. I don't understand it either. He had a swollen area the size of a softball behind his knee. Waved off ibuprofen to bring down the swelling, he was just going to rest it. Momma Africa is from South Africa, hiking until she ""decides to stop"". The other three girls are finishing a section at Fontana tomorrow. They told us the General Store there was permanently closed when they dropped off their car.
This presented a problem. That was our resupply point. We can't hike into the remote Smokies without a resupply. Fontana is the jump off point for almost all thruhikers. We needed to get to a supermarket in another town. Robbinsville was the only option, and calling a hostel seemed the best approach. We decided to hike to the next road, which happened to be Fontana Marina, and call one. The shower had abated and we booked. The others seemed content to stay the night. It was 3:45.
Six miles to Fontana Marina. The sun came out and humidity rose as we descended 2000 feet. All that way I fantasized about cold drinks from the Marina store. But alas! The Marina store was closed. The soda machine was busted, the bathrooms were boarded up, even the picnic table was gone. The phone to call for the village shuttle to run us the 3 miles to the convenience store was inoperable. And we had no cell service. A sign said the resort in the village wasn't taking guests, and that the AT shelter on the lake (known as the Fontana Hilton for its deck, showers, electricity, and wifi) was closed! We learned from passers-by that the entire Fontana Resort had permanently closed, ostensibly because of the state's lockdown. The shuttle didn't even run anymore, because no one was in the village. The village had become a ghost town!
We couldn't call a hostel. We had nowhere to stay, and no resupply option outside a gas station that required walking 3 miles off trail. 
Resigned, we headed for the shelter formerly known as the Fontana Hilton, hoping either for cell reception or, at a minimum, a place to sleep. At the trailhead was a pair of boots full of pebbles. A sign from his widow explained that the owner had hiked the AT to this point before he succumbed to cancer while on trail (at least he died doing something he loved) and that taking one of these stones up the trail would symbolically along him to hike the trail as well. Last year I carried one of these pebbles to Damascus. Now I pocketed one to hopefully place on Katahdin.
Halfway to the shelter we got service again and called Wolfcreek hostel for a pickup. We backtracked to the marina and minutes later Lonnie pulled up in a minivan. He ran us to Robbinsville for resupply at the Ingles and fast food takeout. It must have been fifteen or twenty miles away. Nothing is close around here.
Lonnie's house was full with other hikers, so he took us to his second property, a doublewide trailer with two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, wifi, and washer/dryer. Luxury! 
Spent the even watching Smokey and the Bandit and McClintock, the best things on. Remembered why I no longer pay for cable.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628603,"The bedroom in the Stecoah Wolfcreek hostel's doublewide trailer has glow-in-the-dark stars on its popcorn ceiling. I slept in til 8 since I needed to pick up mail at the Fontana post office, which doesn't open until almost noon. It was a relaxing morning with time for little chores like cleaning the eating utensils, backwashing the Sawyer filter, and clipping toenails so they don't hit the front of the shoe. Sunshine sawed off the ragged end of his broken trekking pole section so it would again nest into the middle section. His tent requires two trekking poles to erect, so even a stunted pole is better than nothing.
Lonnie popped in on a break from his regular job. He's a manager for a utility construction company. Says they spend a lot of time building community-oriented park structures like ADA fishing piers for Duke Energy as well as infrastructure like substations. He's looking forward to retiring though and running his hostel full-time. He's not a hiker but he loves meeting new people and hearing their stories. I told him that's a part of why I hike too - but he doesn't have to walk 2000 miles so he seems to have gotten the better deal!
Sunshine and I grabbed an early dinner (""lunch"" to those outside the southern Appalachians) at the Stecoah Diner next door. The chatty waitress told us the snakes were very active this year, maybe because there are fewer hikers. Had a big slice of her homemade peanut butter pie for dessert. 
Lonnie had to get back to work, so his friend Fred drove us back to Fontana. Fred's retired and spends his time fishing, hunting, and helping hikers. He explained that the Fontana resort owner had given up the lease from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) because the resort could only make money a few months a year, while the maintenance and lease had to be paid every month. Several owners had given up before her. In his view the TVA doesn't care whether a resort is viable there or not. If true, then next year's hikers will no longer have anything to stop for in Fontana. Hostel owners like Lonnie will be the best way to resupply for the Smokies. Oddly no hikers have mentioned this complete shutdown in Guthook - the hiker app - or elsewhere online.
I grabbed my mail at the post office and we returned to the Marina. David was just about to hike out. Seems he is faster than he thinks if he's been catching up to us each day. He had 20 days of food when he started so he hasn't stopped in town at all. His pack was 55 pounds at one point, most of it food.
I forgot to mention meeting a boy scout troop south of Fontana yesterday. Half a dozen boys and several leaders from Waynesville, GA. Very well-mannered. I just heard Philmont was forced to cancel their summer high adventure programs so I expect more troops will be looking for alternative trips like the AT. So far it's been far from crowded so a good time to do so.
We passed the shelter known as the Fontana Hilton. Most of the amenities like a charging station and showers were shut off. Like the rest of Fontana it was a ghost town. The dam visitor center down the road was closed. Practically no one was around. The waters of Fontana Lake were high. Clouds drifted low over the mountains on every side. 
We passed a few dayhikers and backpackers as we entered the national park on a deserted drive and climbed 3000 feet to the ridge. I turned at one point to see a doe staring at me from twenty feet away. I stood still and she went back to browsing. For a minute I watched and filmed her until she heard noises from below and left. Walking ahead of me, Sunshine saw a bear practically falling down the hill below the trail. There has been bear scat on the trail every day since Amicalola but this was the first sighting.
We had a brief drizzle on the lower reaches of the climb, but higher up a storm had soaked several hikers on their way out of the park, and they let us know about it! Most of the afternoon was partly sunny with cool breezes. It gradually cooled down and became cloudy. By the time I caught up with Sunshine at Mollie's Ridge Shelter it was cool enough to pull out the puffy. A light rain started just then and lasted less than an hour while we ate.
No one else came to the shelter. Two woman had left earlier to get to the next one. We also had heard that Garrett, the thruhiker I met way back at Gooch Gap with a white streak in his beard, is just ahead, though apparently moving very quickly. Fred said he'd shuttled him and Garrett was trying to cover the Smokies (70 miles) in two days. Crazy.
Tarps covered the front of the shelter, making it warmer than outside. We encouraged this by building a fire in the shelter's stone hearth. All the kindling and tinder were slightly damp, so on Sunshine's suggestion I brought out my bag of Fritos. The corn oil makes them excellent fire starters. When lit the little chip glows florescent orange. After much coaxing and blowing we got a decent fire. There was not enough larger fuel to really keep it going though. We found a five-foot branch that we couldn't break, but stuck one end in the fire. With a low expected in the 40s we'll take whatever it puts out.","Fontana Marina, NC 28
",Mollie's Ridge Shelter,"Jun 15, Mon",13
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628604,"Chilly last night, high 40s. I slept in my puffy but had no leggings, so I was sweaty up top and cold down below. Had another Slimfast protein shake for breakfast. 2 down, 10 to go... The ripe peach I packed out partially redeemed breakfast.
Plan was to do twenty miles today, then ten to Newfound Gap tomorrow and go into Gatlinburg (the ""oddest town on the AT"" according to Guthook). Sunshine is meeting a friend there, and I've run out of M&M's, so it works out.
Shortly after heading out we ran into a southbounder with wild grey hair named Subway. He left Maine last July, took a break for winter and Covid, and is aiming to reach Springer the end of this month. He looked pretty excited, and had lots of questions about the trail ahead and where to stay in Franklin.
The sky started clear but soon clouded over. It was chilly hiking out, but after my body warmed up it was pleasant. Passed a few backpackers, which I expected. Then I passed a dayhiker, which I did not. The Knoxville man said he had hiked six miles up (3000 feet elevation gain) from Cades Cove to this seemingly remote stretch to visit Thunderhead mountain. He hikes the park 2-3 times a week. I would encounter a number of other dayhikers today. I would say it's possible to slackpack the Smokies given the number of side trails available. For those inclined, they could return to a hostel or hotel every night.
A couple of girls passed us as we lunched on a knob below Thunderhead. One of them carried a bear bell. Bear bells are intended to warn bears of your approach when they are upwind and apparently so distracted they don't hear your footsteps, clacking trekking poles, or singing 80s pop songs to yourself. There is also a theory that bear bells are like dinner bells for bears. They go to investigate the strange noise, rather than fleeing it. Bears, like people, have different personalities. Best not to expect a bell to keep them all away.
On Rocky Top I watched clouds drift around me. By the next knob we were totally socked in by fog. But as we climbed Thunderhead the sun came out and we looked forward to a view. Sadly the whole peak is thick with eight-foot-high rhododendrons, preventing any views. So we followed the rhodo tunnel down the other side.
All afternoon was like walking through a raincloud. It didn't actually rain on me, but the air was so moist drops condensed on me. They also covered the trees and shrubs, which in turn dripped and rubbed against me, wetting me from socks to head. Despite a high close to 60 degrees it felt cold and raw. 
As I approached tonight's shelter at Double Springs Gap I startled, and was startled by, three large wild turkeys. They fluffed their feathers and stalked off a few paces, doing their best to ignore me.
At the shelter a fire was already going thanks to a couple from Wisconsin out on a 5-day hike over numerous Smokies trails. More backpackers trickled in. A father, brother-in-law, and grown son from Alabama, a trio of guys with a church youth group also from Alabama who have done several sections. A thirty-year-old woman from California now working in Vicksburg. And a guy named Joe. Two of the boys from Alabama didn't bring jackets, expecting warmer weather. They sat shivering in front of the fire, shrugging off my suggestion they wrap their sleeping bags around them.
I laid my shoes and socks out to dry in front of the fire. I was a little aggressive I guess, because one of my Injinji sock liners partially melted thanks to the polyester in it. Oh, well!That crackly plastic won't help ward off blisters in that condition. I'll have to get a new pair in town.
Sunshine had cell service. He showed me a new announcement from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC). Apparently they will now encourage thruhikers to return to the trail. So my hike may officially ""count"". So far every part of the trail I've traveled has been open, and now it looks like the entire trail but Katahdin is officially open (Katahdin opens July 1st). The ATC is just bowing to reality. They did everything they could to shame and chase hikers off the trail for three months.  None of it was supported by any evidence, like the speculation thruhikers would infect small mountain towns. In reality it would have been the other way around if at all. And it's the small towns that want the hikers for business. They were the first to reopen. Every shuttler and hosteler has lamented the ATC's actions. Their last announcement several weeks ago was to start forming a commission to study what things to think about before reopening, like some obscure bureacracy, but that they weren't going to do anything until there was a vaccine or the virus disappeared. Now over a month after the forest service and other landowners had removed temporary restrictions the ATC is simply acknowledging the reality that hundreds of thruhikers are returning to the trail, in addition to the hundreds that never left. Okay, rant over.
It's going to be a cold one tonight, maybe in the 30s. Not what I expected for June. Glad I decided to bring at least some minimal warm clothes. You never know with these mountains.","Mollie's Ridge Shelter
",Double Springs Gap Shelter,"Jun 16, Tue",19.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628610,"It was just as cold last night but it didn't bother me as much. But I turned back and forth trying to make my lower back comfortable. Finally around 3am I let some air out of the sleeping pad so my hip could sink in more. Sunshine later said he thought I might be crazy enough to get up and start hiking at that hour. Fat chance. I wasn't leaving that warm sleeping bag until I had to.
Yesterday evening after arriving at the shelter I started cold soaking some rice (cilantro-flavored, mmm). I sent my stove home to save weight, so I'm experimenting with my options. It wasn't ready last night, and this morning it still had failed to soak up the water. Completely inedible. Apparently heat is key for rice absorption. Hypothesis rejected!
I started climbing up to Clingman's Dome, the highest point in the Smokies and on the AT, and second highest east of the Rockies (after Mt Mitchell in North Carolina). Above 5500 feet the forest dramatically changed. It became primeval. It looked like a boreal rainforest, a dark, rich tapestry of shadowy hemlocks and lime-green moss and lichens covering fallen trees and boulders. Ferns dominated the understory. A heavy mist permeated the forest, building to a bluish gray in the distance.
Clingman's tower has a wide spiral ramp leading to a 70 foot viewing tower. It put me just above the trees, and more importantly just above the cloud I had been walking in for 24 hours. Gazing out over the top of the clouds, with glimpses of mountains underneath, felt like a dream. 
Few tourists were up at the tower given the early hour and poor visibility. One family with several daughters made yoga poses as their mother clicked away. 
The AT runs around the summit. I summited from one side and descended from the other, reconnecting with the AT but missing several hundred yards. It sounds trivial, but on my section hikes I was a ""pass every white blaze"" purist and such an act would have bothered me enough to have to return to finish it. Having walked every inch once, I now feel free to hike however I feel in the moment.
The eight mile walk down to Newfound Gap was through more primeval forest with cool, moist air. I felt as awake and alert as I ever have. Truly invigorating. Countless steps formed from roots, logs, and stones. I began to feel my pace accelerate. The struggle I'd felt climbing Clingman's Dome was replaced by new energy.
At Newfound Gap the parking lot was full and tourists swarmed despite the fog. Met a thruhiker named Danny from New York City who started just a week ago and has been blitzing up the trail. It's been colder than any of us expected, but he doesn't even have a puffy so he was tempted to start hiking at 3am to cover the forty miles to get out of the park. But he'd run out of food so, like us, he wanted to get to town.
After 15 minutes of hitching at the exit from the lot, after numerous cars and trucks had turned out, mostly headed in the wrong direction, an SUV with two women stopped. ""Are you serious?"" the older woman driving called out plainly. I assured her I was indeed and just wanted to get to Gatlinburg. She and her daughter were extremely kind to accommodate all three of us. They turned out to be a couple we'd passed on the way down the trail. Thankfully we were polite (as always, of course!)We wound down the fifteen miles to Gatlinburg, passing a massive number of cars parked along the side of the highway near every trail access. For a Wednesday the park seemed inordinately popular. I later found out midweek recently was unusually popular, presumably because so many families are out of work and out of school early. Plus the park recently started closing the popular Cades Cove loop road to all but bike and foot traffic on Wednesdays. In any case, the Smokies are back in business in a big way. 
In Gatlinburg we immediately hit the outfitter. I found Injinji toe socks to replace the pair I melted. Sunshine found a sleeping bag liner to keep from freezing at night. Having swapped out his winter sleeping bag for his summer one a few days ago, he was not a happy camper in the early morning hours the last couple nights.
Danny was good to go. He carries what looks like a daypack and, as mentioned earlier, doesn't even carry a puffy, let alone a liner or toe socks. 
We had lunch (or is it ""dinner"" here?) at the Smoky Mountain Brewery. There are gestures towards social distancing here but life seems very normal and the crowds seem undimmed. I had a big meal of steak, chicken, potatoes, mac n' cheese and a gallon of iced tea. Guess I needed some protein.
I hit up the Days Inn for a room and got a hiker rate of just $50 for a remodeled room with two queens, which Sunshine and I split. Cheaper than many hostels! Resupplied at Old Dad's General Store (hits too close to home!), which mostly consisted of more Fritos, Cheerwine (a regional cherry-flavored cola), and RC Cola which I thought no longer existed but is better than Coke.
By far the highlight of my day was a video call with my wife and kids. Seeing their faces and catching up with their lives back home helps me keep perspective on this journey and stem some of the homesickness. I do miss them, and I hope it helped them as well to see Dad and know how much I think about them. 
Sunshine met a friend from Tennessee for dinner and I veged, trying a Gouda cheesesteak from Hot Diggity Dawg (quasi-blasphemous to a Philly boy) and walking around the Branson-like manufactured entertainment of Gatlinburg, contrasting so sharply with the natural wonders of the Smokies looming above us.","Double Springs Gap Shelter
",Newfound Gap / Gatlinburg,"Jun 17, Wed",10.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628674,"I was a little groggy waking up in the Gatlinburg motel. Fresh air makes for more alert mornings. We put ourselves together and got breakfast at Crockett's Breakfast Camp next door, decorated with stuffed heads of every kind of animal in the park and specializing in giant cinnamon buns. (more photos over on Instagram)
It was a tough hitch out of town, despite a steady and slow stream of traffic going up route 441 toward Newfound Gap and an easy turnout behind us. After close to 30 minutes an SUV stopped with an older couple from ""lowland"" western Tennessee who often come to hike in the park. As we headed up the mountain the road was again lined with parked cars near every trailhead as people flocked to popular dayhikes. We watched fog curl around the mountains like smoke, which gives the mountain range its name.
The day had an unpromising start as fog enclosed Newfound Gap and rain began falling in the first few minutes. By the time we reached Charlie's Bunion, a popular outcropping of rock with striking views, the rain had stopped but the fog was impenetrable. Beyond the outcropping was a blank nothingness. It made the dropoff seem even more imposing since you couldn't see how far it went.
I continued along the ridgeline, eventually doffing my rainjacket because I was sweating more than the rain had wet me. The sun struggled to come out. At various points I could see across the valleys.  ""Smoke"" drifted around the peaks as the cloud ceiling stayed below 6000 feet.
Met a small contingent from Troop 417 in Florida hiking the entire park north to south. When the leader learned my home state, he mentioned one scout had researched and written a paper on Penn State football history, specifically an incident in the 40s when the team insisted on fielding its black players over the objections of the Cotton Bowl, which eventually relented. The boy was shy and didn't want to discuss his work, but I encouraged him to pursue his passion for history. The scout leader also mentioned they'd met a thruhiker named Slingshot who claimed to be hiking 30 miles a day. Guess I won't be seeing him, unless he burns out and slows down.
Had a late lunch at Tricorner Knob Shelter as my energy was waning and was thinking of stopping for the day. Just missed Sunshine. Earlier I had suggested to him pushing for the next shelter in order to get to Max Patch tomorrow, a great view point for sunsets, and he must have decided to meet me there. So before heading back up the trail I quickly scarfed down a corned beef sandwich I had packed out from Old Dad's General Store in Gatlinburg. It was only 4:30, but Joe and another hiker at the shelter had already built a fire and scrounged every last bit of deadwood, all of which was damp. The woman from California, who had been hiking at the same place as Joe, left the trail at Newfound Gap because she was disappointed by the lack of views. Too bad, because this afternoon's views were beautiful.
The nearly eight miles to Cosby Knob Shelter went quickly. After a gentle summit of Mt. Guyot around 6300 feet it was nearly all downhill and mostly dirt trail. I averaged 3 miles per hour in this stretch without much effort. There were frequent views to the eastern and western peaks and valleys, with fog-smoke rolling in and out, as the trail stuck mostly to narrow ridges along the Tennessee-North Carolina state line. In some places the ridge was less than six feet wide, with sharp inclines on each side. In another it was wide enough for a helicopter to land, as indeed was marked on the map.
Sunshine was eating dinner outside Cosby Knob Shelter when I arrived. Voices came from inside behind the tarp. He said the shelter was full and pointed out tent sites he had found. I pitched the Duplex for only the second time in a flat if stony spot, then went up to eat dinner - a leftover biscuit and jelly from breakfast, and Oreos. After hanging the food bags I learned there were several open spots in the shelter, but the occupants had gotten their dander up because our permits were not for this shelter on this night. Apparently a ranger was checking permits when they started out at Newfound Gap, though we've not seen one in the four days we've been here. Anyway it was not worth an argument as it's a pleasant night and the tent spots are decent. If it had been raining it'd be another story.
Tomorrow we finish the Smokies and head on toward Hot Springs, one of the premier trail towns.","Newfound Gap / Gatlinburg
",Cosby Knob Shelter,"Jun 18, Thu",23.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628675,"Today was a lot of walking. I've covered nearly 48 miles since leaving Gatlinburg yesterday and my feet are feeling it.
Woke up later than usual in the tent at Cosby Knob, around 7. Sun rises around 6:20 but the forest and tent filter it. Packed everything up, a process that takes a good fifteen minutes since I have to deflate and roll up the sleeping pad along with stowing the tent. Foam pads are so much easier, but far less comfortable. Guess I'm getting old!
Sunshine and I trooped off after a light breakfast. After three miles of down and up over nice trail we took the side trail to Mt. Cammerer (pronounced ka-MER-er). Usually a mile-plus roundtrip would be passed up but I skipped this last year due to heavy rain and had to see what the fuss was all about. Near the end the side trail crossed many boulders and had awkward footing. Horses are allowed on the AT and other trails in the Smokies, but in this case the hitching post was situated before the boulders began. The rocky path led to a two-story octagonal stone tower with a wooden catwalk built into a rocky outcropping overlooking the northern end of the park. A light rain sprinkled us as we explored the 1938 CCC-built structure, named after the park service director at the time. Fog surrounded us except for a narrow view to Davenport Gap in the east. 
Getting back to the trail three women from last night's shelter were resting and asked us about our hike. They asked if the trail was open, under the impression that big parts are closed. We would get the same question from a couple other folks today. Seems the rumors of trail closures spread a lot farther than the truth. Of the 2193 miles of the AT only 3 miles in Maine (Katahdin above treeline), 27 miles in Virginia (the McAfee Knob area often swamped by dayhikers), and the portions in the Smoky and Shenandoah national parks were ever closed. The national park service owns most of the trail and pointedly ignored a request by the ATC in March to close it in its entirety. Trailheads were closed in some areas for a few weeks, and many shelters and privies are still closed, largely because maintainers haven't been allowed out to keep them up. The trail is now open everywhere except Katahdin which opens July 1st. In the Smokies the shelters are open and rangers are once again encouraging people to use them over tenting.
We descended 3000 feet over relatively easy trail and past numerous cascades on Stateline brook to Davenport Gap, the northern end of the Smokies. Shortly beyond we walked into Standing Bear, an open-air hostel with a series of cabins and outbuildings with kitchen, showers, laundry, bunkroom, resupply store, and more. One cabin is a treehouse. Another is over a stream. We had chili dogs and lots of soda and enjoyed the sun finally making an appearance after on and off showers all morning.
One of the young helpers was caring for a baby skunk, whom he named Zorro, whose mother had died. It had a distended rectum from eating solids to replace momma's milk and he was trying to get one wildlife agency after another to help rescue it. Ultimately none of them would take responsibility. He intends to get a state license that will allow him to keep the skunk as a service animal, a kind of therapy skunk. The young man, still in his teens by his looks, had escaped from a drug-addled home and friends to start a new life here. 
Sunshine and I set out in the middle of the afternoon to hike another 14 miles to Max Patch, a grassy Bald known for spectacular sunsets. It was almost hot by now and we sweated climbing the 3000 feet out of the gap. The trail was mostly soft dirt but was constantly climbing or descending. At one summit I passed an FAA radar station that looked like some 1950s vision of a futuristic ice cream bar. 
My earbuds died yesterday so I've taken to listening to my audiobook without them. I turn it off when other hikers are near. It helps pass the time, without letting my mind run in circles all day. Finished ""Grandma Gatewood's Walks"" and working through another Bill Bryson book ""The Thunderbolt Kid"" about growing up in Iowa in the 50s.
Several hours later I caught up with Sunshine at a stream just below Max Patch. He had a startling story. He'd heard a loud HISS a few minutes back and feared a snake was near. Instead a football-sized turkey hen came out of the foliage and charged directly at him. It was apparently quite serious and wanted him dead or gone. Having no training in wild turkey charges Sunshine defended himself on pure instinct, kicking at the small bird. It predictably went hurtling away. Sunshine escaped with his life. Whether the turkey was defending her brood he doesn't know. By the time I came through there was no sign of it.
Max Patch was, unsurprisingly for a nice Friday evening, littered with tents from locals overnighting and parked in the lot a couple hundred yards away. The view was incredible, with mountains stretching in every direction from this unobstructed 4600 foot grassy plateau. The Smokies loomed in the distance, under a cloud of course. The sun set a bit early thanks to our altitude, but into a cloud, giving the mountains ghostly shades of light blue and the clouds pink and orange highlights. Misty tendrils blew across the summit.
A cold wind whipped up and sent us into our tents once the colors had faded. The locals stayed up late but I was quickly asleep.","Cosby Knob Shelter
",Max Patch,"Jun 19, Fri",24
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628699,"The sunrise peepers started stirring in their tents on Max Patch around 5:30. I slipped out of my warm(ish) sleeping bag reluctantly, wondering if I shouldn't have gotten up in the middle of the night to see the stars. Most nights I'm under forest cover so I shouldn't pass up these opportunities just to spare myself a few minutes' chill. 
The sun rose out of a low cloud over the mountains, but still impressively streaked the entire horizon with pastel rainbow hues. Mountains took on multiple hues and clouds blazed with color as the orange globe began its arc across the sky.
The tent, of course, was soaked with condensation, the price of camping in a grassy meadow even at 4600 feet. It got stuffed in a sack to be dealt with later. Breakfast was washed down with iced tea, as I'd dropped a tea bag in my water bottle last night. Goes down easier for me than Plain Old Water (tm).
It was twenty miles to Hot Springs and we had an early start. We wound through the tent city, across hilly meadows, and back into the forest. It was well-beaten dirt path that rose and fell gently, followed the contour of hills, stepped across rocky streams, and was hedged in by dense ground vegetation. 
At Walnut Mountain shelter I noticed my tea bag had exploded, making my water filter work overtime to keep the tea leaves from reaching my lips. Sunshine happened to have a tiny strainer that fit the mouth of my bottle. I'll have to work out the kinks on this tea steeping. 
Passed a number of weekend backpackers, as well as a foursome of fathers and sons we had met at Standing Bear yesterday, now hiking back there from Hot Springs. They'd climbed 2000 feet to the summit of Bluff Mountain that morning. Which meant I had a long downhill to look forward to. 
During intermittent cell service I got word that the pool pump back home was busted. Of all the difficulties in preparing for a thruhike at this stage in life perhaps getting ahead of home maintenance is one of the most unpredictable. Something is bound to go wrong no matter how carefully you plan. I don't like to put my wife in the position of having to deal with these often frustrating situations. I'm usually the one banging my head on the wall.
The weather was near perfect today with partly cloudy skies and gentle breezes. The temperature and humidity began to rise in the afternoon. It would near 90 in town later. After many miles of often steep downhill I emerged on the outskirts of Hot Springs at the door of Laughing Heart Hostel. I found Sunshine down the road at the first restaurant, Bluff Mountain Diner, eating a twenty-ounce burger on the porch. I inhaled a huge iced tea and dug into my own colossal pile of beef fajitas. By the time I got down to the outfitter and tried out their scale I was at my starting weight again. Must have put five or six pounds on in the last hour. Well, at least I'm not starving!
I'd gone to the outfitter to look for a package that was supposed to have arrived today - a new, and lighter, backpack to replace my care-worn Osprey Exos. But it has been delayed. The post office doesn't open until Monday, two days from now, so I'll have to make some calls and have it bounced ahead to another trail town. Oh well. Shipping these days has been completely unreliable. What should take 2-3 days takes a week, and tracking is notoriously misleading. I'll have to target a town far enough ahead to be sure it beats me there.
We settled in at Laughing Heart hostel. It's a comfortable and hospitable place with only four guests tonight. I had visited Elmer at the Sunnybank Inn to see if he was taking guests. In addition to providing lodging in his huge, rambling Victorian full of books, antiques, and instruments, he makes gourmet vegan breakfasts and dinners. I found the genteel octagenarian on the porch, and he regretted he wasn't yet open. He hopes to reopen in time for the southbounders this fall. Somehow he seemed to remember me from last spring.
Showers and laundry are a wonderful thing. You really appreciate the little things when going without for many days. Feeling clean and fresh, Sunshine and I headed to Dollar General for a decidedly unhealthy resupply. I'm not sure it's possible to resupply there otherwise. Fruit and vegetable options consist of applesauce and fruit juice, and maybe strawberry ice cream. I will have to wait until Erwin in three or four days to visit a real supermarket.
Today was Midsommer's Day, the solstice, start of summer, and longest day of the year. By tradition it is also Naked Hiking Day. Sadly, or perhaps not, we forgot about this and so did everyone else. But someone near the hostel did decide to celebrate with a few fireworks. Happy Summer!","Max Patch
",Hot Springs,"Jun 20, Sat",19.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628767,"It would have been nice to stay in town a bit longer but the show must go on. Besides, most of Hot Springs is closed on Sunday, including the best restaurants. So we packed up, thanked our hosts, and stopped at the Hillbilly Market for breakfast sandwiches. That's plural, because we skipped dinner last night since we had still been digesting our monumental lunch. 
I bought replacement earbuds at the Dollar General - we'll see if $5 earbuds last five times longer than $1 earbuds - and hiked out of town. Past the closed post office, the closed Spring Creek Tavern, the closed outfitter, and the closed Hot Springs Resort and Spa. In World War I a grand hotel had been here, and the US government leased it to use as the largest POW camp on American soil. 1700 Germans and German-Americans were placed here, whole families apparently. But it was a very civil affair. The prisoners and townspeople mixed socially, the POWs put on concerts for the community, and after the war some of them liked it so much they moved to Hot Springs. The spas are that good.
I crossed the French Broad River and hiked a sandy path along the turbulent river, with several thunderous rapids and falls. The trail climbed up the hill steeply, eventually coming to a rock outcropping over the river called Lover's Leap. The name comes from a Cherokee legend:
Mist-on-the-Mountain was the daughter of chief Lone Wolf. He wished her to marry a powerful older brave named Tall Pine but she was in love with a handsome young visitor named Magwa. After her father refused her marriage request she secretly met Magwa on the cliffs above the river, known then as the Tahkiostie. Enraged, Tall Pine followed them and killed Magwa. He cornered Mist-on-the-Mountain on the high cliff, where she heard Magwa's spirit calling to her. She leapt into the river to join her lover. Moments later a panther attacked and killed Tall Pine.
It may as well be Romeo and Juliet, and certainly has the plot elements of a Hollywood tragic romance. On this sunny day, however, the rock provided a lovely view back to Hot Springs and the hills around it, but little drama.
I struggled much of the day with the rising heat and humidity. The trail climbed, dipped, and climbed some more. I collapsed at the first shelter to eat lunch, a Hillbilly Italian sub (with bologna?), and sprayed myself head to toe so the gnats would give me peace while I rested. 
A firetower on Rich Mountain broke up the day. Several families were visiting, it being Sunday. The view was gorgeous, though not different than the last few. More splendid blue mountains and green valleys! I passed a number of hikers and backpackers in the first ten miles out of town but spent the last few hours seeing almost no one. Sunshine had left town a few minutes ahead of me and he was doubtless well ahead by now given how sluggish I felt.
Two miles from my destination of Little Laurel Shelter the thunder began. It roared from one direction, than another. Just give me forty more minutes, I pleaded! It continued to rumble threateningly but the rain held off as I pumped furiously up what seemed the steepest climb of the day. Finally I reached the shelter. Two guys already in their long johns had built a fire. I quickly claimed a shelter spot and retrieved water. Sure enough within minutes the rain began. Light at first. 
The two men hadn't seen Sunshine. I figured he'd gone on a few more miles to shorten the hike to Erwin over the next couple days. With a storm looming I wasn't about to follow, so I settled in. The hikers were not together, but both had done all or part of the PCT. The older man and a woman named Janet are thruhiking together. The younger man is training for a longer hike, hoping to complete the northern half of the AT this year and the CDT next year. He came out feeling pretty out of shape and is taking it slow.
A few minutes later I hear another hiker approaching. He peers in. It's Sunshine! Somehow I passed him when he was getting water. I had run out of water myself during a dry stretch before this shelter. He was pretty worn down by the day's climbs as well. At least it's not just my age! Sunshine is only twenty-five and by any measure the stronger hiker.
Fortunately for Sunshine the worst of the storm held off to this point. As we made dinner in the shelter it poured buckets outside for over an hour, ultimately extinguishing the perky little fire. Nature's timing couldn't have been better!
Looks like we'll be out for another two full days and reach Erwin on the fourth day at this rate. The spacing of the shelters makes it difficult to get there in three days. There's a somewhat technical stretch of boulder scrambling called Firescald Knob coming up that we decided was best left for tomorrow.","Hot Springs
",Little Laurel Shelter,"Jun 21, Sun",19.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628768,"This morning was warmer. For the first time in a couple weeks I didn't mind getting out of my sleeping bag. It was late again, relative to sunrise at least. Even near the longest day of the year the sun doesn't rise until quarter after six around here, and no one in or near the shelter stirred until near 8. 
The older hiker from last evening I'm calling William Wallace. He appeared this morning in a green plaid kilt, black tights, a long-sleeved loose off-white shirt, and homemade buffalo skin shoes. Along with his hair swept up in a knot and a full beard he's the picture of an ancient Highlander. He rekindled the fire and boiled a pot of coffee. 
I trekked out and hit Firescald Knob in the midmorning, a rocky, often bouldery ridge with beautiful views. In bad weather there's an alternate trail to avoid the exposed ridge. At the high point is Howard's Rock, a perfect viewpoint and large flat Rock for resting. It's named for a longtime trail builder, Howard McDonald, a retired engineer who led the five-year relocation of the trail to this ridge. He often mentioned wanting to move this large flat rock up to the ridge for a picnic spot. On the last day of trail work his crew secretly moved it up, taking the strength of six men. Howard proudly showed it off to friends and family, including on his 80th birthday, until he could no longer hike up here.
The sun was heating things up and humidity was rising. I took several breaks, including on Howard's Rock, with its view across the Tennessee Valley. I heard some frustrated sounds from amongst the thick azaleas lining the twisting trail and a backpacker, an older Southern lady, appeared. She apologized for her ""cussin' "" in negotiating the rocks. Other then her there were just a few dayhikers about most of the day.
I stopped to visit a supposed firetower on Camp Creek Bald, but all I found were radio antenna and a fenced cell tower. By this time Sunshine was far ahead, and I took my time meandering through today's miles.
While lunching at Jerry Cabin Shelter I watched two butterflies dance and chase each other away over something on the ground which must have been highly prized in the butterfly world. They wouldn't stay still for a portrait. Unusually, the spring here required walking a good way uphill for water.
Some miles on, fifty yards off trail, are the gravestones of William and David Shelton, arranged in a shaded grassy clearing amongst a number of sitting logs. The brothers were Union soldiers. They were killed when they came to the area to visit relatives during the war.
Later as I walked briskly down a mountain holding my trekking poles horizontally in one hand, I ran across two white-haired hikers. The first called out ""Are those fishing poles?"" As he came close he laughed at the error. "" I lost my glasses somewhere back there!"" he gestured vaguely down the hill. He's lost four or five pairs recently. Said I'd look for them but saw nothing, and heard no crunch under my shoes, the usual technique of finding lost spectacles. 
Stopping at Flint Mountain Shelter for a break, an older section hiker named Swift, who's planning to bike cross country to San Diego then hike the PCT, told me Sunshine had left just a few minutes earlier. We heard thunder in the distance. Shortly after I moved on, a strong wind blew through and dropped the temperature and pressure noticeably. Whuh-oh! Sure enough the rain followed just as I pulled on my poncho. It poured buckets on me for about an hour as I trudged through mud and rivelets. I don't mind midday downpours. The poncho keeps my pack dry. My clothes dry out quickly. Only my shoes and socks remain sodden. Though it doesn't require rain to do that.
As the rain subsided I took a short detour at Rector Laurel Rd to Laurel Hostel, where a trail-side sign promised cold drinks. I packed out sodas and a couple beers to split with Sunshine later. Jimmy ""TwoToke"" and a tall lean mountain man with a long white beard were holding court telling tall trail tales with two young women guests outside the hostel.
I put in another six miles which included a long but not too taxing 1600 foot climb over Sugarloaf mountain. Didn't reach Hogback Ridge Shelter until well after 8. Long day! Sunshine thought I had disappeared. In the shelter I found two section hikers: a middle-aged former thruhiker named Solomon and his wife, out on her first backpacking trip. They're finishing at Sam's Gap tomorrow just a couple miles away and had extra food. Also a young man thruhiking named Bearfoot. He's been flipping around to finish the south and plans to jump up to Harper's Ferry shortly to complete the northern half.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628770,"I never drank my Budweiser last night. Carried them six miles up a mountain, gave one to Sunshine last night. Gave Kansas boy Bearfoot the other to pack out today. I'm more of a Coke than a Bud guy, especially when hiking.
The morning was bright and clear. I managed to get up right around sunup, even though the sun wouldn't be visible over the trees for awhile. I had firm purpose today: Erwin was only 27 miles away. Town food was within reach. So off I set with a determined pace, Sunshine in tow.
At Sam's Gap Interstate 26 runs over the trail. Waved to some dayhikers getting out of their car. A few miles later a friendly collie came up to us. She belonged to the same hikers, now coming from the other direction. They had put a car at Sam's Gap and started at another trailhead further north. They were curious how we planned to get to Maine in time. 
We climbed and climbed steadily up to Big Bald's open summit. The wind picked up nicely at I left treeline and evaporated the sweat. On a colder day it would have dangerously cooled me. But today it was like stepping into air conditioning.
A couple young families hiked up to visit the bald from some unseen parking lot. The full circle view included Erwin, 18 trail miles away, as well as far off Unaka mountain and the imposing Roan Highlands, nearly as high as the Smokies with summits hidden by clouds. I'll tackle those after Erwin.
As I descended Big Bald I spooked some whitetail deer. Four times they let out a cry halfway between a rusty door hinge and a high-pitched growl. There were three of them, so it seemed to be a warning to the others. Each time they would bound off 10 or 20 yards further down the trail only to repeat the cry and flight as I approached. I don't believe I've ever heard a deer vocalize any sound. It was quite surprising, yet distinct and unmistakable.
Many miles later near Devil's Creek Gap a turkey hen ambled near the trail, much smaller than the three males I saw in the Smokies, clucking or gobbling to herself. Perhaps tut-tutting my presence. Well, at least she didn't charge at me!
After twenty-one miles we stopped at No Business Knob shelter for a snack. It was already a long day, and it was only 3. A gregarious dad and his two teenaged boys were taking a break, having just started a week-long trip south from Erwin. He was very friendly with a kind of nervous energy and had lots of questions for us, including the ubiquitous ""Isn't it getting late in the season?"" For a moment he entertained heading for our last campsite by tomorrow night. When told it was over twenty miles away he thought better of it. Said they were carrying too much food - 7 days. But that's probably what they'll need to get the 70 miles to Hot Springs. Our 2-3 days' rations only works because we're moving quickly.
My feet and quads continued to take a pounding on miles of downhill. At one point I said this continuous descent on narrow sidehill trail was getting monotonous. God fixed that problem for me right away. The skies opened up and it poured on us for an hour, and the trail turned sharply upward for what seemed like almost as long. It was, at any rate, going uphill far longer than the map seemed to allow for. I was happy to see the sun pop out once again as we entered the final couple of miles of downhill to the Nolichucky River.
A hostel called Uncle Johnny's is right at the trailhead. We got a cabin (with air conditioning!) and showers, and Charlotte, Uncle Johnny's widow, drove us into Erwin to hit up the Bojangles and Taco Bell for dinner. Relaxed and ate on the open air deck as the long evening fell.","Hogback Ridge Shelter
",Nolichucky River (Erwin),"Jun 23, Tue",26.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628777,"First zero day. Stayed over at Uncle Johnny's. Charlotte's daughter Claire shuttled Sunshine, me, and a newly-minted NC State grad named Wesley to town for breakfast at Bojangles and resupply at the Food City. Sunshine retrieved a package containing his replacement trekking pole part. I wanted to visit the outfitter to try on trail runners, as my Lone Peaks have lost so much traction it's been tricky negotiating wet roots and mud the last few days, but they opened too late. I'll either have to order the same shoes I have now or take a chance on something new - not a slight risk if I plan to get 700 miles out of them.
Bearfoot had hiked in by the time we returned to the hostel. He's finished the south and renting a car to drive up to Harper's Ferry tomorrow. Not long out of school, he's built trails in Colorado national forests with AmeriCorps. Naturally he's already looking at hiking the PCT and CDT. A section-hiking couple also came in, in the middle of a 150 mile southbound hike. The man goes by Question-Keeper, for asking oddball questions like ""What two colors would you swap if you could?"" rather than the usual banter.
Had a video call with my family, which I've been looking forward to. Cell service and Wifi have been poor for the last week since I called in Gatlinburg so it was great to see their faces. All seems to be well, plus tonight is takeout night so they're all smiles! Later Sara got the pool pump working again with the spare parts that arrived early. What a relief - pools need a lot of babysitting. Maybe I can pass the hat as pool fix-it man - though I wouldn't blame her if she demurred!
Another evening shuttle, this time to Walmart and an Italian place for dinner. Got a replacement dollar rain poncho since mine is getting some holes. But you get what you pay for - it tore apart the second I took it out and fluffed it open. Also got a new smartwater bottle. I'll try using that as my clean bottle so I can flavor the water with tea bags and powders, things which clog up the Sawyer filter when I drink through it.
Erwin is surrounded by beautiful green mountains. It's an old railroad town - a central point on the supply line for coal from Kentucky and West Virginia throughout the south after World War II. Nowadays I-26 roars past it between Kingsport and Asheville. The area has great outdoor potential, but doesn't strike one as particularly oriented that way. It reflects the culture and challenges of Appalachia as much as any mountain town. It's unlikely claim to fame is being the only town to hang an elephant. In 1916 a circus elephant attacked her new and very unqualified trainer, killing him. For some reason the local authorities thought the solution was to treat the elephant like they would a man convicted of murder. Except they needed a huge steel girder to hang the elephant. I doubt anyone disputes now that the elephant got a raw deal. Rather than downplay this idiosyncratic history the town has embraced it, providing four-foot tall elephant statues for local painters to decorate, displaying them all over downtown, and auctioning them off for charity. 
Every good zero day must come to an end. At least if I want to reach Maine this year. The feet and legs had a chance to rest and the belly is full. Ready to tackle Unaka mountain tomorrow!","Nolichucky River (Erwin)
",Nolichucky River (Erwin),"Jun 24, Wed",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628805,"Woke up in Uncle Johnny's hostel to rain that had started during the night. It alternated between drizzle and downpour until finally tapering off around 11. We took the breakfast shuttle to town to kill some time. The hostel cat took a liking to me as I relaxed in an Adirondack on the porch. Once the last downpour had exhausted itself Sunshine, Wesley, and I hiked across the bridge over the Nolichucky River and into the woods.
I crossed paths with almost no one all day. Early on a pair of sixty-something dayhikers struck up a concert. One had a daughter who had thrued in 2013 and knew some of the trail in Pennsylvania. He thought it was pretty late to start. How many miles were we doing?
The three of us caught back up at Beauty Spot, an open bald below Unaka Mountain. For some reason the bald itself, with the views, is not listed in the AWOL guide. Despite this oversight, it offered fantastic views back to Big Bald and down to Erwin. By now the rain had gone for good.
Climbing Unaka I entered a dense spruce forest with lime-green moss-covered trunks. There was no ground cover at all. You could walk freely amongst the trees. They were so dense that any direction you looked there was very little to see other than trunks either near or far. The ancient feel of the forecast was accentuated by the near total silence, save for an occasional songbird.
Weather was wonderful after the rain petered out. Moderate temperature, falling humidity. The trail climbed 3500 feet to Unaka from Erwin but it was well-graded. Often muddy and slippery in spots, especially with my aging shoes.
After 17 miles we made it to Cherry Gap Shelter around 6. It had been planned as our stop for the night thanks to the rain delay, but Sunshine had a new plan. Hike 9 more miles to the next shelter so we can reach Rt 19E tomorrow and stay at Mountain Harbour B&B hostel, home of the best breakfast on the trail. I thought it over carefully for several milliseconds and agreed to join him. Even Wesley was in for another 9 miles. He wanted to keep up with the thruhikers for a day. 
The trail remained fairly easy with rolling hills. The sun set behind us, illuminating the trees from the side. We hiked the last two miles in the dark and reached the shelter around quarter to ten. There a strange sight awaited us. Two packs hung in the shelter, cookpots and other equipment strewn about, but no people and no sleeping bags. As I entered a mouse froze in my headlamp beam in the act of scampering down a line toward one of the packs. I grabbed it by the tail but it escaped and darted into a corner of the shelter. 
I scanned the area for tenters. Nothing. I called out to see if they were at some nearby viewpoint. No answer. Figuring they'd been taken by Bigfoot we flung out our bags and ate dinner. When Wesley went to get water he reported two hammockers were a mere 30 feet from the shelter but apparently dead to the world. Ah, well, no Bigfoot this time.","Nolichucky River (Erwin)
",Clyde Smith Shelter,"Jun 25, Thu",26.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628827,"Last night was possibly the best sleeping weather so far. Not too warm, not too cold, not too humid. I likely would have slept straight through, except for antics of the resident mouse (mice?). It ran and leaped from pack to pack, hanging as they were at the front of the sleeping platform. At one point it scurried up and rested on the foot of my sleeping bag. A swift kick made sure it wouldn't try that again. In the morning there seemed to be no damage to the packs. The trick, aside from removing food, empty wrappers, and that Snickers bar you forgot about at the bottom of your pack, is to leave all pockets and zippers open so the mouse can explore and satisfy its curiosity. Lock the door, and it'll chew its own window.
After a late wake up, the hammockers eventually appeared. An older couple, they have been bouncing around on the southern AT, but are getting off in ten miles at Carver's Gap.
Wesley decided he's taking it easy today after chasing us yesterday for 26 miles. He's going to find a nice grassy bald to lie down in for awhile.
I lost Sunshine early in the day after expending too much energy in the first several miles. I took it easy climbing up Roan Mountain. The dayhikers were out in force. I stopped at Cloudland, site of a nineteenth century resort long since removed, to lunch at a picnic table. I watched tourists drive in to the lot, get out and go over to the information board to judge whether they wanted to walk up any of the trails, then as often as not get back in their cars after just using the restrooms. 
From that point on the dayhiker traffic went from ""nice weekend"" to ""Elvis sighting"" level. For the next ten miles I politely passed groups of all ages and abilities making their way around Roan High Knob, Carver's Gap, Round Bald, Jane Bald, and Grassy Bald. One of the visitors clued me in on the attraction: the rhododendron bloom is at its height. The rhododendrons were indeed nice, though not much in evidence on most of the balds. The views, however, were spectacular. White puffy clouds drifting over endless blue mountains in every direction. 
The trail was tougher today, a combination of many steep ups and downs, a lot of rocky, stony, muddy, and rooty sections, and some very narrow and deep track in the grassy areas that made it difficult to stride normally. Then, of course, there was the necessity of stopping every minute or even more frequently to let a train of people pass from the other direction.
Finally, once past Grassy Bald the trail dove back into the green tunnel and I saw almost no one. Until, that is, I reached Overmountain Shelter. It's an old barn whose hayloft can hold 30 hikers. I know because I was with that many last year when a tropical depression dumped many inches of cold rain on the area. But the barn is now condemned for structural issues. Tenters were there, to take advantage of the beautiful western views. 
I continued over the balds of Little Hump and Hump Mountain, areas I fled through last year as lightning struck around me. This time I was able to take in the sweeping hillsides, winding trail, and glorious horizon.
My feet had been feeling the pounding from the first few miles today, and they squawked as I descended steeply for the last six miles to the gap through which US 19E crosses. Some 2500 feet of constant downhill with knees and feet taking much of the shock. After a very long day, the second in a row, I reached the road at 7:30 and found Mountain Harbour B&B a few minutes west. Sunshine was there, surrounded by a pile of chicken wing bones. I ordered a burger from the food truck run by the hostel owners and let my dogs out to bark. 
Thanks to the rhododendrons the bunkhouse is full, the B&B is full, and a number of folks are tenting. But we had reserved yesterday, specifically to be here for the trail-famous breakfast tomorrow. Among the mostly weekend hikers and sightseers was a retired Lubbock ""farm boy"" named Helo, who flew helicopters for thirty years. He left Springer May 3rd and is taking his good old time up the trail until he goes home to help with the cotton harvest in October.","Clyde Smith Shelter
",Route 19E,"Jun 26, Fri",24.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628837,"The highlight of Mountain Harbour is breakfast, and they did not disappoint. Over 30 people lined up for a buffet of every kind of breakfast dish imaginable, each one a culinary delight! And only two of us were thruhikers, so there were plenty of leftovers. Sadly I felt so full after one humongous plate I could only pick at seconds. Such a waste! Of course I knew I'd be hungry again in a couple of hours.
The hostel is spread out on the hillside with the house up on the hill and the bunkhouse next to the creek. Two identical twin striped cats hang out in the hostel. Up at the house are two dogs including Mooky, ""three-quarters wolf"" and probably some husky, so hairy that she was recently sheared like a sheep. All the animals, except the taciturn billygoat, were eager for a good scratch. The dogs got so excited they started wrestling each other.
Walking out of Route 19E the trail climbed through several open meadows. We missed an early morning shower, but the wet grass did a solid job of soaking shoes and socks, never to recover. Rain came on and off for hours. Even when it stopped, the wind would pick up and knock drops off the trees creating a mini-shower, and the shrubs would brush me with watery leaves.
In between showers we passed several lovely waterfalls gracing the area including Jones Falls, Mountaineer Falls, and Hardcore Cascades. 
It was at Mountaineer Shelter, close by the falls, where I had an unsettling encounter last year during a section hike. I didn't write about it then because of potentially endangering hikers on trail. 
I'd come upon a middle-aged man named Puck Carrier and a young woman named Ninja. They told me a character who called himself Sovereign was nearby. He had threatened Ninja and some other hikers with a shovel (news reports said a machete) a few days earlier near Sam's Gap and been arrested, but they couldn't hold him. Ninja was concerned he'd recognize her. We agreed to stick together at the Mountaineer shelter for lunch and see what happened. Sovereign wandered in soon, shirtless, unkempt, and with an unsettling look, with a small dog in tow. He immediately began acting oddly. He scribbled graphitti across a board hikers leave messages on. Poked into every crevice in the shelter. He asked us all kinds of probing questions, then evaded even the most routine questions in return like ""where you from?"" with accusatory retorts. He demanded we sign the shelter logbook. If we declined, he demanded our name and wrote ""Did not sign!"" Then there were the conspiracy theories he kept muttering about under his breath, about people being after him, government spies, etc. He found a fishing rod in the shelter and shoved it in his pack. He referred to his dog by multiple names. When asked if one was a trail name he answered ""He has a thousand names - one for each of his personalities."" Ooh-kay.
Puck Carrier goaded him with a sports taunt into admitting he came from Boston, and even that he'd had some trouble there, which appeared to include having been committed to an asylum. Meanwhile other hikers were coming up the trail and we posted someone at the turnoff to warn them of the situation. Eventually Sovereign moved on, apparently recognizing there were many of us and he had outstayed his welcome. But we then had the question of how to proceed. No one wanted to camp near him. We waited a couple of hours before hiking out, planning to tent together before the next shelter where he'd likely stop.
Along the way we passed other hikers already setup for the evening. They reported seeing Sovereign, but with TWO dogs, not one. We deduced he'd nabbed some local's stray dog at the gravel road we had crossed. Sovereign (who went by many names) was always complaining he had no food and didn't want to go into town to get any, no doubt fearing arrest. Several times he threatened he would eat his dog. Apparently he said this to many people. 
The next morning we arrived at the shelter to find two ex-Marine hikers who said they had stayed up in shifts to keep an eye on the guy. They had not taken any guff from him and dressed him down for freaking people out. A third hiker passing through had confronted Sovereign about the new dog. He had seen him remove and hide its tags. The hiker took the dog from him and hiked off. It was eventually reunited with its owner through Bob Peoples. 
Sadly Sovereign's antics continued. Trail magic was set up at Dennis Cove Rd that morning, complete with a burger grill and beer. Sovereign had so many beers he became violently belligerent and the trail angels had to make him leave. He was so drunk a hostel owner drove him into Hampton, took pity on him and gave him some food and supplies. But Sovereign was later picked up by the sheriff. He was released again, without anyone to press charges, and found his way back to the trail near Watauga Lake, again sending concern rippling up the trail. News reports show that Odie, who publishes the hiker yearbook, picked up Sovereign and took him to Bristol and bought him a bus ticket home. But he never got on the bus, and a week later caused the now well-known tragedy on the trail in Virginia. By that time I was home, but people I'd been hiking with were closely affected.
It was a seemingly preventable tragedy. It was certainly foreseeable. But in reality there was little that could be done to remove or dissuade this obviously unstable man despite so many people's efforts. That was the truly tragic part.
After dwelling on this history I felt run down much of the rest of the day. Probably not eating enough. I went through all my snacks early on. Maybe these 25 mile days are wearing on me.
There were almost no other hikers. At the last shelter I met a sixtyish guy named Barry who fretted about the weather and a graying Massachusetts woman named Sunkist.
After a further six miles I turned off at Dennis Cove Rd for Kincora hostel. Kincora is run by Bob Peoples, the legendary trail maintainer. He's a very friendly, gracious, and approachable guy who chatted with us for a couple hours. We are the only two here tonight. Aside, that is, from six cats and a litany of woodland creatures that frequent the property including racoons and a shy bear.","Route 19E
",Dennis Cove Rd (Kincora),"Jun 27, Sat",24.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628883,"I had more time this morning to get to know the trail-famous Bob Peoples, owner of Kincora hostel and one of the most influential trail builders since Myron Avery built the original trail in the 1930s.
At 77 he's still an active hiker, having recently hiked along the upper Nile in Egypt (mostly desert), the ancient road from Istanbul to Troy (now desert as well), the Jesus Trail in Israel, and the original route from Marathon to Athens (historically disappointing). If the year had gone as planned he'd be hiking in Scotland right now.
Bob is known for mobilizing recruits for trail projects. He goes into local colleges that require community service to get maintainers involved. He also runs the Hard Core crew that mobilizes 100 hikers from Trail Days every May to build trail, shelters, and bridges.
Special AT license plate donations secure funding for trail clubs in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia. But the ATC controls it. The clubs must apply for grants from their dedicated funds. And the ATC is a rather profligate spender. They recently gave the forest service $35,000 to build a bridge over a creek. Bob's Tennessee club did it for $6,000. It's a similar cost to build a shelter. Because all the labor is volunteer. 
Trail maintenance is a learning process. The forest service, for instance, built shelters in the 1960s facing the water source, which was typically downhill. That was also where the wind usually swept in from, often dumping snow on the sleeping platform. Now the standard is to face east, out of prevailing winds and into the morning sun. In fact the trail clubs don't share best practices and new ideas very well, something Bob's trying to improve and which is one of the ATC's core responsibilities it has long neglected in favor of political priorities. Simple ideas like applying anti-graphitti varnish to shelters, or wire to strengthen bridge spans, are used by one club but unknown to others. The Tennessee trail club, a private outfit associated with Eastman Chemical, is blessed with many retired PhDs to improve their structural designs. But due to environmental and other impact studies it takes 3 years just to replace a shelter, even in the exact same footprint. Some shelters remain where they are only because they would never get approval to relocate or improve them, particularly in Wilderness areas. This gives me a new appreciation for the occasional odd placement of shelters.
Most of the Tennessee trail club section was roadwalks when Earl Schaffer completed the first thruhike in 1948. From six miles off-road it's grown to 150 thanks to land acquisitions and trail building. Early acquisitions in Tennessee were by eminent domain which infuriated the local farmers and created a tradition of hostility to the trail in some quarters. More recently they've been purchased with leasebacks so families can keep using the land outside the trail corridor.
Bob grew up in a poor Boston neighborhood, of Scottish background. He didn't see an animal ""bigger than a wharf rat"" until a school program introduced him to forest ecology like beaver dams. He'd like the ATC to concentrate on school programs to educate and involve the next generation, rather than fanciful marketing campaigns like the Wild East created by someone who's never hiked the trail.
He was in the military working on aircraft engines and began hiking to have time to himself. In Vermont he joined the Green Mountain Club. When his kids graduated he and his wife drove down every back road crossing the trail in the south looking for a property to build a hostel. That hostel, Kincora, named for the castle of Brian Boru who tried to unite the Scottish and Irish people, is full of thousands of photos on the walls and ceilings from hikers for every year since 1997.
For his trail building efforts Bob was inducted into the AT hall of fame in 2018. Bob Peoples is so famous for his prodigious efforts he's the Chuck Norris of the AT. Legends abound. Bob Peoples doesn't get blisters, he gives his boots blisters! Bob Peoples doesn't get his permits checked, he checks the rangers' permits! Bob Peoples doesn't hang his food bag, the bears hang it for him!
If all the bureaucrats, lobbyists, and grant writers at the ATC were more like Bob Peoples and just got stuff done instead of trying to make themselves look good, the AT would be far better off. 
We got a late start after resupplying at Dollar General with Bob's help, and hiked to Laurel Falls. After weeks of rain it was brown with runoff and flowing high. The trail afterwards snaked around a sheer rock wall on a narrow ledge next to some rapids before climbing over Pond Mountain.
I ran into Sunkist again on the way up. Her husband fishes while she hikes, and meets her at road crossings. Good way to reconcile divergent interests.
It was a wet day. It rained heavily early in the morning, then showered on us as we climbed. Mist, and the wind whipping drops off trees, kept us from drying out. It's supposed to be like this for several more days.
Lunch was at a small beach on Watauga Lake. I took a dip, the sun came out, and I started to dry my socks and poncho. Families were picnicking and kids swimming. Then came some thunder in the distance. Within minutes a stiff wind blew through, and a light rain quickly became a massive downpour. We hurriedly packed up, threw on raingear and marched out. Those dry-ish socks lasted about 3 seconds in the river that was now the trail around Watauga Lake. The shower lasted maybe twenty minutes but it was enough. Drips, mist, and wet vegetation ensured there'd be no drying out. 
At Watauga Dam the rain started up again and subsided. Then at Wilson Gap I expected to start an easy six mile ridge walk to the shelter. But I glanced at the map and found a 1200 foot climb instead. Not two minutes later a rising white noise started. Was it just wind, coming to knock more drops on my head? Or a rising clatter of rain? Or, hopefully, a nearing waterfall? Well, the last was pure wishful thinking. I stopped under a rhododendron to assess how strong the rain would be and whether it was a passing shower. The answers: strong and getting stronger, and no! So back on with the poncho for the fifth time today and off I trod into a furious shower. It was more like someone pouring pail after pail of water on me than a shower, really. Enough to soak me even with the poncho.
The trail continued upward and it seemed never to end, even when I'd supposedly reached the ridge. A group of dayhikers passed going south, looking rather unhappy. When I finally reached the shelter Sunshine told me they'd started from the picnic area and accidentally followed the AT up onto the ridge instead of a trail around the lake. They had nine miles to backtrack and were clearly not prepared for thundershowers.
Everything feels damp, even my nominally dry sleeping bag and clothes. The NOAA weather forecast was laughable. It called for 60% chance of showers and up to a quarter inch of rain, despite a massive front hanging over us. With the strong winds that blew multiple storm clouds through so quickly it must be a thousand miles wide! Hard to miss on a weather map. If meteorologists had been around in Biblical times they would have told Noah ""cloudy with a chance of showers"" right before the 40 days' flood. 
More of the same tomorrow, if the forecast is to be believed. Should be in Damascus the day after. I would really like some dry clothes.","Dennis Cove Rd (Kincora)
",Vandeventer Shelter,"Jun 28, Sun",17.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628884,"Everything was wetter this morning than when I hung it last night, thanks to more heavy showers overnight. Two 37-year-old women, identical twins, came into the shelter last night having hiked up from the lake. They had thruhiked when they were 19 and were now sectioning to Damascus. As thruhikers they were called the Cubs, or cub reporters, for asking so many questions. And indeed they were curious about us and our hike. It was good to talk to some other hikers after a quiet day.
All morning I hiked through a cloud, which sounds a lot more romantic than it is. In practice it means water condensing on trees and shrubs and dripping on passing hikers, grass and dense foliage soaking shoes and socks to the point you can squeeze a cup of water out of them, and mist dampening everything and reducing visibility to 50 yards. It's downright claustrophobic, and somewhat depressing. 
At a shelter after seven miles Sunshine and I sat without speaking, eating all of our snacks. Nothing needed to be said. It was miserable hiking. We headed out and eventually descended toward a road and below the cloud. A handicap-accessible portion of the trail led across a field of wildflowers with distant blue mountains. Then across a pasture with a minefield of cow patties. The herd had more calves than cows, a fertile spring. 
With the cloud lifted, the forest opened up and felt like less of a prison and more of a home. Though the trail remained narrow, muddy, and overgrown with invasive plants and prickly vines. Not my favorite stretch of trail. Met a backpacking family - mom, dad, two daughters - at a shelter break. Our conversation was interrupted by incredibly loud thunder that seemed right on top of us. It drizzled on us for awhile, but the worst of the thunderstorm struck farther north.
I passed few people. Two pairs of backpackers near the end of the day, one pair with a dog carrying saddle bags. At the Abingdon Gap Shelter we found a retired couple out for a section to Roan. They've been hikers for forty years, doing the Long Trail, Maine, and Adirondacks with their kids, and in retirement sectioning nearly all of the AT. Also met a southbounder named Ramble who started last June and took the winter off. He has the gift of gab and would still be talking our ears off if he hadn't retired to his tent. All in all a quiet day of putting in miles, no matter the weather. Tomorrow we should reach Damascus in the morning. And I'm really hoping for a milkshake.","Vandeventer Shelter
",Abingdon Gap Shelter,"Jun 29, Mon",22.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628885,"Left the shelter early after a night of frequent heavy showers to get a late breakfast in Damascus. Spent ten miles walking through the clouds again - same drips, mud, and rain as the last God knows how many days. But the trail was easy and downhill most of the way and I popped out between two tidy lawns into a residential street in Damascus.
Took a nero - near zero miles - and spent the rest of the day in town cleaning up, filling up, and resupplying. I picked up new trail runners at the post office and a new backpack from ULA called the CDT. Lighter and frameless, I'm a little nervous about the fit and feel. But now that my base weight is fairly low it's the logical next step to trim weight and volume. My old Exos pack has over 3000 miles on it and could enjoy a well-earned retirement. But it will go ahead a week or so to Pearisburg in case I want to switch back.
We stayed at Broken Fiddle hostel where Treehouse and Smoky took good care of us. The Cubs, the twins we met two days ago, popped in as we had dinner around the corner, mildly surprising us by catching up. Other than that it was a chance to relax and regain strength for the next section: Grayson Highlands and beyond.","Abingdon Gap Shelter
",Damascus,"Jun 30, Tue",10.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628949,"We had a late morning start, after a hearty breakfast at the Damascus Diner. I didn't think I would eat much after two dinners last night, one at the Wicked Chicken and one cooked up at the hostel using steaks bought by one of the other guests. But I demolished the hiker special again. 
We took the Virginia Creeper trail out of town for about 14 miles instead of following the AT. The Creeper trail is not only level, it follows the Holston River through a peaceful valley rather than jouncing up and over viewless hills far above the water as the AT does. Rivelets of water sprinkled over sheer cliffs into the river. This old railroad bed crossed the river at least a dozen times on wooden and at least one iron girder bridge. Scores of cyclists passed us, riding the seventeen miles downhill to Damascus from the eastern end of the trail. Shuttlers in Damascus drop them off in the morning.
Taking an alternate route is known as ""blue-blazing"" and is frowned upon by some hikers who follow only the official white blazes. And in fact the ATC only recognizes hikers who have made an effort to walk the entire official trail. I did exactly that when I section hiked the trail. But having seen every white blaze I am now quite open to exploring alternate and perhaps more scenic routes. Among long trails, the AT is unique in focusing on a single path to completion. Other long trails have many alternates, sometimes imposed by closures or forest fires. What ties it together is a continuous line of footsteps from beginning to end. Though of course ultimately it's up to each hiker to decide what a thruhike means to him.
About halfway along the Creeper Trail we passed through the hamlet of Taylor's Valley and were surprised to find a railroad car with a porch built in front and housing gym equipment for the community. They repurposed an old ""camp car"" originally used to house railroad maintenance workers when there was no motel in the area. The community also has a small cafe aimed at the cyclist traffic. An OPEN sign was set up next to the trail, so we walked over eagerly hoping for the milkshake I missed in Damascus. Sadly the cafe was closed. A man was mowing the picnic lawn around it. Many bikers came through excitedly only to be similarly disappointed.
I left the Creeper Trail where it again intersected the AT and hiked two miles up to Lost Mountain Shelter. There a section hiker was drying out his tent and clothing from last evening's storm. He's out for a month, but might come back to try to go all the way this year. First he has to help his son move in to the University of Kentucky, where he's pursuing a pharmacy degree.
Sunshine and I had planned to stop here, a sixteen mile day, because the next shelter was another thirteen miles. But it was only 2:30 and the weather was beautiful so we decided to hike up to Whitetop Mountain with its open summit. 
In fact the weather was nearly perfect. Sunny, partly cloudy, drying up, occasional breezes. It was a bit warm in the sun, something I haven't had to deal with much in the last month, and I sweated profusely climbing hills. But it was glorious not walking in a cloud, not being poured on, and not having soaked feet.
So I climbed up 2000 feet to Buzzard Rocks on Whitetop's bald summit. There was a dayhiker enjoying the grand southern view of blue mountains. It was the lawnmower guy from the cafe! He'd driven his Jeep up to a nearby trailhead to take in the view as he often does. He apologized that Wednesdays were the only day the cafe was closed. He pointed out a peak to the southwest, Pond Mountain, that separates Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee. A doctor built a house up there over thirty years ago accessible only by helicopter and with stunning views. But according to our friend the doctor ironically went blind. When he died the back taxes caused his children to give it up to the state of North Carolina. And it was subsequently plundered and damaged by looters and vandals.
It was almost 6 pm, but rather than tent on the bald we decided to push 7 more miles to Thomas Knob shelter. Mostly to get to Marion a little earlier on Friday for an easier resupply. Thomas Knob also sits on a bald, a side of Mt. Rogers.
On the way up Mt. Rogers I noticed a deer a few yards away. She didn't startle. I stopped cold, stood perfectly still, and watched. She stared back, occasionally shifting and peering around. I wonder what she thought of this two-legged creature just watching her? She never spooked, but eventually decided I was not a threat and went back to searching for food.
As I broke out of the trees I climbed into a pastel sunset over open meadows on the western slopes of Mt Rogers. Puffy strato-cumulus clouds glowed pink and orange. A three-quarters full moon floated above, waiting for its turn to set.
Several thruhikers were already in their hammocks near Thomas Knob Shelter, though only Thor, a Tennessean who started in March and took a few weeks off, was still up and finishing dinner. Sunshine and I had the two-story shelter to ourselves.
A very friendly pony visited us as we finished dinner and darkness was setting in. She wanted to lick my hands and legs for the salt. She was quite persistent and eventually we had to shoo her away to get our food stored properly. This area has a history of problem bears. The bear box was several minutes walk away, over a fence and in a clearing full of ponies grazing on grass. A young foal was among them. 
As I write this my pony friend has returned. She is licking some stray water bottles on the picnic table outside the shelter, and knocking over all the trekking poles to lick their salty handles. Now she's gone over to see what goodies the hammockers have. I have a feeling I'll be hearing more from her tonight.","Damascus

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628950,"The salt-happy pony visited the shelter a couple more times last night, licking anything left on the picnic table. It went over to the hammockers and nibbled at their bags and shoes until the occupants yelled out and drove it away. Not an easily deterred pony.
In the morning the hammockers turned out to be three more thruhikers traveling together - Miles, Mountain Goat, and Fenway. They started in March and had only gotten to Unicoi Gap in Georgia before getting off trail for awhile. They returned in May and have taken about two months total to get here, currently doing around 13 miles a day. Miles has the wild hair and beard of Harry Potter's Hagrid. Mountain Goat, also quite shaggy, seems perpetually serious and stressed, and Fenway is an energetic and lean young guy.
I passed 500 miles soon after leaving the shelter. No one marked the trail this time. By the time I hit 1000 I will still be in Virginia. It's a big state.
The ponies were out in force in the next several miles of open country. I encountered a least three small herds, all with two or more young foals. The mothers are quite affectionate with the newborns, rubbing them with their noses again and again. Not many other hikers out this early, but passing close to Massie Gap and the parking lot the traffic picked up. Should be a busy day here. 
The Grayson Highlands are an open stretch of high meadows with rocky outcroppings. They were cleared by farmers to graze cattle. When the forest service bought the land they brought in ponies to help keep the vegetation down and maintain the views. The ponies are technically wild and should not be fed or touched. Unfortunately they've learned they can get food from people and are not at all shy. Still, they are efficient grass-eaters and keep it very closely cropped, even miles from the main tourist areas.
I stopped many times to rest today. Sat on a hill of boulders to take in the view. Took a long lunch and short nap at one shelter. The sun was out all day and humidity was rising. Better than being rained on, but it does sap my energy. I tried to eat and drink more to compensate, with limited success.
My new backpack, the CDT by ULA, seems to be working out. Yesterday it took some getting used to, being a frameless pack. There is a foam sheet in it to transfer some weight to the hips, but it requires cinching the waist belt very tightly. It was noticeably more comfortable today after eating several pounds of my food. Frameless packs are best for carrying under 18 pounds. I will have to shop more carefully. Recently I've been packing out more food than needed.
The miles in the afternoon were back in the shade of the green tunnel, at lower elevation. I descended below 5000 feet and won't see that again until New Hampshire. I passed almost no one. The Cubs, the twin girls, did pass going southbound late in the day. They were dropped off in Atkins and are hiking back to Damascus. We marveled at the gorgeous weather compared to the days of sodden hiking south of Damascus.
Sunshine and I are the only ones here at Trimpi Shelter. It has two-level bunks on each side of a fireplace, though it's far too warm for that. We were told there's a problem bear in the area, so we have rocks within arm's reach to discourage any nighttime prowling.","Thomas Knob Shelter
",Trimpi Shelter,"Jul 02, Thu",25.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628956,"Today was going to include a midday resupply run into Marion. It's six miles off trail but a community bus sometimes runs up to the Mt. Rogers National Recreation Area visitors center, where the trail crosses Rt 16. However the bus only runs if you call in advance, and we've had no service for days. Plus it required a ten mile hike before the 11am run, even if we could schedule it, and we didn't make a serious move to leave our cozy sleeping bags until after 7. So, new plan! Flexibility is key to thruhiking! We hike 22 miles to I-81 in Atkins and stay on an alpaca farm. Wait, hear me out! We can resupply at the gas station. No, wait, it gets better! There's a Mexican restaurant in the gas station. Okay, sold!
Most on trail planning goes pretty much like this.
A dayhiker stopped by to use the privy as we packed up. We followed him out, and caught up at a gravel road a couple miles north. He had just hiked six miles from Dickey Gap, part of his effort to section hike the trail over many years. He's over 1000 miles into it. It sounded like he squeezed this in while his family slept in at the motel. They're planning to tour the Grayson Highlands later today. I've met many section hikers who've patiently and opportunistically pieced together much of the trail over many years, even decades. Thruhiking is not possible or even desirable for most, but completing the AT is still a goal they can't let go of.
A long ridge led us to Partnership Shelter, near the forest service's visitor center. We'd been told a homeless guy named Wizard had been living here as recently as two days ago, in one of the nicest shelters complete with shower and pizza delivery, but there was no trace of him now. The visitors center reportedly had a vending machine though so we hurried over.
Of course like most forest service facilities this one was closed, and the captive vending machine was locked inside. The humanity! A phone outside offered hikers a link to call for pizza or shuttles. We suppressed the urge, eating deeper into our lean food bags for lunch, and took off for Atkins.
I found the afternoon tiresome. The ridge was not high or steep but it felt like a roller coaster. Switching rapidly between climbing and descending over and over is more tiresome than a single activity. Add in the loose rocks on the trail and it became mentally taxing as well to watch each step. I stopped several times to sit, relax, cool down, eat, drink, and regain my energy.
Finally I crested the last mountain, Glade, and descended toward Atkins. I stopped at a restored 1894 one-room schoolhouse called the Lindamood school. It's open to hikers to stay the night, which seems incredibly generous and a bit foolhardy from an historic preservationist perspective. Please respect this property if you visit. The Settler's Museum nearby was closed and still had its ""Closed for Winter"" sign out. 
A few more miles through forest, meadow, tall grass, over the Middle Holston River, a railroad, and a big boardwalk I reached the road near the I-81 exit and found Sunshine vacuuming up goodies outside the convenience store. After I quenched my thirst we patronized a Mexican joint attached to another gas station next door. There I ordered the Grande Special, which filled a 16"" plate. It was, however, no match for my voracious appetite. 
Long Neck Lair, a nearby alpaca farm, hosts hikers and we walked down the road and up a hill to the red aluminum-clad home with amazing views of hills on both sides of the valley. The trail passes behind the property as it winds toward the road and I recall seeing the house from there and remarking on its commanding placement. The alpacas had been shorn a month prior and bags of hair filled one room. Their ungainly long necks were stretched out munching grass and ignoring the new passers-by.
The day ended with the sun setting over the ridge and a large moon rising. Tomorrow we hike out of the Great Valley which the interstate follows and enter the ridge and valley portion of the Appalachians.","Trimpi Shelter
",Atkins,"Jul 03, Fri",21.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628984,"Woke early at the alpaca farm thanks to a clear sky and an east-facing window. Earlier I had trouble sleeping and went out to the deck to witness a fantastical scene of silvery mist resting in the hollows below the farm, in the glow of the nearly full moon. 
Ken made us coffee before we took off. He grew up on the Oregon coast and bought this farm with Cyndie in 2014. He remodeled the barn into a home, and is now building a 10-person bunkhouse addition with septic. This area is becoming spoiled for hostels, with at least 3 others within twelve trail miles. But none of them have alpacas! There are also several flocks of hens and a few roosters. Though some are getting aggressive and need to go. Ken recounted the hens he's lost to a fox or which just wandered off, obviously taking a close interest in his flock. One of the hens let me pet her.
Crossing under I-81, with a stop at the gas station for breakfast, we wound through meadows choked with tall grass, wildflowers, and prickly plants before returning to forest. For miles we heard an indistinct whine, almost like a siren. Finally I realized it was cicadas. The seventeen-year hatch has been active in western Virginia. We found a few moltings on the trail to confirm our suspicion.
A mile in, at the tree line, we found a memorial to Stronghold, the hiker killed near here last year. It was a senseless tragedy. From news reports it seemed he had found new meaning through hiking, so at least he died doing something he loved, and possibly saving another's life in the process.
I met married thruhikers Roam and Strider leaving their campsite as I walked by. They're from Tulsa where they've worked three years since college and remodeled a house to flip it. Now they are ""homeless and jobless"" and planning a life of adventure for awhile. After the AT, perhaps a year working and touring in New Zealand. They started the AT in early March but got off at the NOC when sheriffs blocked off Graham county (Fontana) to all outsiders late in the month. They returned in May and are on day 62. Strider's lost at least 30 pounds and trying to eat more. He looks and apparently feels healthy. Sedentary people often see drastic weight loss early in the trail until their body adjusts.
We had to navigate more overgrown fields. Our legs became itchy and swollen from all the brush. The sun, so long missing in action last month, was now brutal and unforgiving out in the open. Going under the trees the temperature instantly dropped ten degrees. The growth was so thick and high it was difficult to follow the trail as it switched back through the meadow. We had to bushwhack a couple times to regain it.
Here, two or more mountain ridges removed from the interstate, the valley is sunny, green, and above all quiet. Only the birds are heard. A car rarely appears on the road running down the valley. The homes are spaced so widely even Daniel Boone - who once looked out his window and, seeing smoke rising on the horizon, declared the neighborhood was getting too crowded - would be happy.
After twelve miles we took advantage of a break at a hostel right near the trail called Bear Garden. Bob and Roberta ushered us into the air conditioned bunkhouse where we cooled down with cold drinks and ice cream. A young thruhiker named Rooster was there, another who started in March and came back in late May. Roberta said there's a small bubble of hikers about ten days ahead, judging from the 5-6 people who were staying there daily.
It was tough to pull ourselves away from this little refreshing vortex. Roam and Strider arrived and decided to call it a day after six miles. The heat was getting to them, and apparently they were still recovering from some big miles they'd done earlier in the week. They plan to press on until they run out of time and then flip up to Katahdin to finish the rest southbound.
Sunshine and I dithered about how far to go, but followed our usual pattern of hiking into the setting sun and climbed twelve miles and two thousand feet up to Chestnut Knob. Here there is an enclosed stone shelter - due to the exposed wind and cold on this partially bald ridge. We are the only ones inside, though I spotted tenters at the treeline some hundred yards off. The meadow is thick with grass and it's difficult walking anywhere off trail. 
On the way up we met a dayhiker out very late in the day. He was geocaching, and showed us an ammo box he'd found with logs inside. He planned to leave a Union Jack patch which he said already had 80,000 miles on it.
We also had a rare creek to ford. The bridge had washed out quite spectacularly, with the broken carcass pushed against the far bank. The water was shallow though, so the only question was whether to plow right through or go barefoot. Sunshine busted through like he did on PCT crossings. I valued my dry feet too much after so many days of soggy feet and took off my shoes. This may be the last ford until Maine
Atop Chestnut Knob at the shelter, a beautiful sunset glowed behind trees, while in the east the full moon rose with near-blinding brightness. In the rural valley below scattered farms and homesteads shot off fireworks until well after dark to celebrate Independence Day.","Atkins
",Chestnut Knob Shelter,"Jul 04, Sat",24.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629006,"It never really darkened last night. The full moon illuminated the shelter for hours, followed by an early gloaming. The valley below was shrouded in tendrils of mist, like islands rising from a grey-white sea. 
Hiked out past a family tenting a hundred yards north under tree cover. Oddly the grassy meadow had almost no condensation. I'd later hear from another hiker that the family shunned the shelter because someone had been vomiting in it yesterday afternoon before we arrived. I know, too much information , right? But curiosity killed the cat. ""Um, which bunk?""  First one on the left by the door. ""Oh, that was my bunk... it seemed clean though."" Ah, the joys of shelters.
The trail started out with a big downhill, but reverted to a roller coaster pattern with lots of rocks as it followed the ridgeline. So far Virginia has been quite rocky. I don't mind the larger rocks that are firmly dug in and provide leverage for climbing or braking. It's the loose rocks that slide or threaten a twisted ankle. It requires some concentration to plan several steps in advance to maintain an adequate pace. Add this mental fatigue to the physical exertion, humidity, and heat (up to 90 degrees I was told), and my energy sagged early on. 
Took a couple of breaks just sitting on the trail, very uncharacteristic of me. I usually push on regardless. Sometimes I just needed to take off the pack. Unlike the Exos, whose taut mesh separated the pack from my back to allow some airflow, the CDT, like most packs, is directly against me. My back sweats profusely, so much so it runs down and soaks my shorts. I know, too much information again. But this is hiker reality. You're wet when it rains and you're wet when the sun shines. 
Water was scarce. Sunshine reported going a quarter mile off trail to find a puddle of water. I had grabbed an extra liter climbing Chestnut Knob last night so was able to hold off the seven or eight miles from the shelter to a creek. 
Passed a young couple backpacking southbound, and later an older section hiker named D6. After the Caterpillar tractor, an ""old tractor stuck in first gear"". He's a Mainer, who does trail maintenance up there including relocating privies. God bless him! Currently hiking from Pearisburg to Damascus.
The terrain eased up after Laurel Creek, where I splashed cold water over my head and soaked my shirt to get some natural air conditioning. In fact thunder started booming in the distance and a wind blew in. Then lightening cracked less than a second from us, putting us on edge for a bit. A light rain, barely noticeable, was enough to take the worst of the heat off as we pounded out the last miles along dirt sidehill trail with easy grades. Soon we emerged at route 52 a few miles north of Bland. 
Sadly the Brushy Mountain Outpost, a hiker favorite diner located right at the trailhead, is closed on weekends for the time being. But I had called Mongo from Lickskillet Hostel to pick us up. He dropped us in Bland to resupply at the Dollar General and fill up at Subway. Then returned and took us through Dairy Queen's drive-thru for the milkshake I've been craving for the past 500 miles. Thank you, Mongo! Much needed!
He brought with him a dreadlocked thirty-something named Dead Bear, a multiple thruhiker whose pack with water and four days' food is only fifteen pounds! He started March 1, but had to back out of the Smokies when they closed in late March.
Tortoise and three other thruhikers were at the hostel, an old country church converted to a huge open space full of real beds, comfortable sofas, and a kitchen. They are all planning to flip up north within the next week or two. Their old trail family stayed on trail throughout and are now approaching Vermont.  They started way back in mid-February with tag numbers around 150. Even that early there were fifteen people at Springer the day they started. They hiked through several snowstorms early on. Twelve inches on the tent one morning. Four inches when tackling the difficult Albert Mountain climb. One hiker actually died back in February. Probably from hypothermia and delirium-induced exposure. He was found off trail by search-and-rescue five days later. Severe hypothermia induces such mental confusion it causes you to feel hot and discard protective clothing. Not to be downplayed. Always come prepared to stay dry when it's cold and wet. I know, I had a case up in Maine (in August!) and certainly wasn't thinking clearly for awhile.
On a brighter note, the beds are very comfortable here and Mongo is going to slackpack me 18 miles tomorrow. After that it will be a short day to the famous Woods Hole Hostel which I've never visited. This stretch has developed so many great hostels in recent years it's becoming known as a hostel-hopping run. A book called Platinum Blazing the AT calls out many of the excellent (and cheap) accomodations for those wishing to ""hike"", not necessarily ""camp"", the Appalachian Trail.","Chestnut Knob Shelter
",Rt 52 (Bland),"Jul 05, Sun",22
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629039,"Lickskillet Hostel has the first collection of thruhikers I've spent significant time with on this hike. And everyone is taking a different path. Just Jim, a full-bearded fifty-something from Columbia, makes a great impression of a former Dead head. Sold his house and lives out of his Jeep. He's been moving his Jeep up trail every few weeks but is stopping here, possibly to flip up north or try again next year.
Butcher, in his forties, is agonizing over logistics to flip up north to rejoin his tramily who are nearing Vermont, before flipping back to finish the middle. Waterqueen, with long white locks, is packing 12 pounds of fruit today and planning to flip up to Maine. Tortoise, a Clearwater retiree, is going slowly to Pearisburg to meet his wife before flipping up to Katahdin. 
Mongo offered to slackpack me today. Since I plan to stay 33 miles north at Woods Hole tomorrow I took the opportunity to knock out 18 miles over easy terrain and relax this afternoon. Almost as good as a zero day. Sunshine opted to go a few more miles. First night we've been apart for weeks, but I should see him at Woods Hole. 
The mileage was mostly over a bumpy ridge with a few moderate climbs. No real views, but the understory was open and spacious, unlike the narrow tunnel much of Virginia has been so far. Sunny all day with the now usual rising heat and humidity. 
The biggest change was a near total lack of water for those 18 miles. I neglected to fill my water bottle at the hostel and started out with less than a pint. Chatting with Sunshine, I stepped over a stream within the first hundred yards in the woods and didn't realize it was the last flowing water I would see until the end.
Miles passed with no water source at all. After 9 miles I searched out a ""seasonal"" source that was a bone-dry river bed as far as I cared to follow it. So I held out another three miles, passed up the quarter mile downhill hike to a similarly unreliable source at the next shelter, and was stuck with the ""stream"" another mile north. Marked as reliable in my guide, it was nothing more than a few shallow puddles with barely detectable movement. Time to scoop, and filter out the brown mud suspension.
Not that any of this is unusual in the summer, just new to this hike. A warning to watch my water supply. It will be no better through most of the mid-Atlantic section. Clear high mountain streams in the southern Blue Ridge have spoiled me.
I passed 600 miles today. Someone created a literal milestone out of rocks, but I was in the zone and walked right past it. I did, however, continue to hear the distant drone of cicadas and saw numerous specimens on trail, at the end of their very short adult life.
Finally emerged at an impressive wooden suspension bridge over the Kimberling Creek (guide says not safe to drink - the only water for many miles). Mongo was there and shuttled me a half mile to Trent's Grocery for a cold drink. Tragically, the milkshake machine was out of operation, and the clerk showed no interest in making an effort to rectify that.
Once Dead Bear, a fortyish dreadlocked Key West building framer thruhiking for the third or fourth time, returned from the slackpack, we headed to the much better Amish market down the road. We were joined by Just Jim and also Rooster, who we met a couple days ago at Bear Garden. He got fed up with his job manufacturing robots and took off, unencumbered, to figure things out.
I'm a little surprised to see an Amish community down here in Appalachia. I live near the best known Amish community in Pennsylvania's Dutch country. The shop was like coming home, filled with products not found at Dollar General, like real birch beer, real corned beef, and homemade baked goods.
Tuna and Minnow joined us at the hostel later, a free-spirited couple in their fifties. They hiked with Roam and Strider for most of the trail and are trying to sync back up. They are weighing when to flip up to Maine. Minnow wants to avoid cold weather after a rough March start.
Got to call home and see Sara and the kids on video. It's storming in Pennsylvania, but they all look good. Looking forward to a week at the shore to break the summer routine.
Capped off the night watching ""Walk in the Woods"", guaranteed to make any hiker smile at its parody of trail life. As Mary Ellen would say, ""Big mistake! You should have bought a three-season tent!""","Rt 52 (Bland)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629054,"Sleeping weather has been fantastic since Damascus. Moderate temperatures and relatively low humidity. If I'm not sleeping in an open shelter I'm sleeping in a bunkhouse with open windows. Last night at Lickskillet Hostel was just as pleasant. So I woke energized and ready to take on the trail.
Mongo dropped Dead Bear and me at route 606 where I left off yesterday. Mongo's planning to close the hostel for the season, or at least until southbounders start appearing, and go hiking himself. The tragedy for many hostel owners is they are hikers themselves, but are too busy during prime hiking season to get away. 
The trail remained well-graded and easy walking. Two miles in I headed down a side trail to Dismal Falls. A creek flows over bedrock before cascading down solid steps into a clear pool large enough for swimming. I took off my shoes and carefully crossed barefoot over the ledges through ankle-deep cascades.  No one was about, so I went skinny-dipping to avoid soaking my clothes. The water was warmer than I expected, and quite refreshing. The sun was high enough to illuminate the pool and nearby ledges. 
After drying out and returning to the trail I followed it along a creek for a ways through dense rhododendron thickets. It remained in the bottomlands for many miles, crossing innumerable streams over wooden trestles and logs. Water, water everywhere today. If only we could divert a couple of these streams south to yesterday's dry stretch.
At Wapiti Shelter I caught up with Tortoise, Butcher, Waterqueen, and her friend Mountaineer, an attempted thruhiker who left the trail and is joining her for a couple days. They'd hiked less than seven miles and were restless, so decided to push on at least through the coming climb.
The trail climbed 1400 feet over a couple miles, though the tread remained mostly dirt. It was easier going than I expected. Near the top I chatted with a southbounder named Billy. He had a massive unkempt white beard and locks, and a huge, dirty pack. He'd just come from Woods Hole hostel and couldn't stop recommending it. In fact he couldn't really stop talking at all and the conversation started going in circles. I had to politely take my leave after twenty minutes. 
The trail took a rocky turn in the last couple miles, circling Sugar Run Mountain. I left it at Sugar Run Rd to walk the half mile to Woods Hole Hostel. A restored nineteenth century log cabin perched on the hill facing into the sunrise, it presides over a collection of cabins, a bunkhouse, gardens, farm dogs, and goat pastures. Neville the owner was out but several itinerant helpers showed me around. One, a slight kid with a wispy beard who goes by Tennessee Slim, is working a few days to pick up cash, doing yard work and repairs. He and his Siberian husky are hiking without a destination for six months. 
Woods Hole is famous for organic home-cooked meals, but it was a busy day so Neville brought back Thai takeout. She rang the dinner bell on the porch and the guests and staff went around to introduce themselves and say what they are thankful for. I named the good people I've met on the trail (which is nearly all), but even more so my family at home who have been so supportive. Afterwards Sunshine, Butcher, a retired thruhiker named Boats, and the raft of helpers dug in. Boats lives on a houseboat and travels up and down the eastern seaboard. His wife is currently supporting his hike by car. Butcher is retired law enforcement who lost his wife to cancer a few years ago.

Butcher is nursing a painful Achilles heel and staying a couple of days. But he's a persistent guy. Plans to finish the trail if it takes til November. Boats hiked out before breakfast. I didn't notice the time and didn't get my act together until 10. Sunshine beat me out to have more time at the post office in Pearisburg.
A cool dry breeze blew over the farm all morning. I could have easily stayed all day or maybe all week rocking in a chair on the porch overlooking the valley.
The ten miles to Pearisburg over the ridge had only gradual ups and downs. After touring through numerous rhododendron tunnels it turned up and wended through thick brush under an immature tree canopy. The dense vines and prickers snagged at my arms and legs as I pushed through. Where the brush was controlled the path was covered with long grass that concealed rocks waiting to stub a toe or twist an ankle. The sky was overcast and it was relatively cool, if a bit humid. A light shower had me scrambling for the poncho, not knowing how heavy it might have become. 
Stopped at Docs Knob shelter, which has a new deck in front of the shelter to cover a muddy area. Thank you Roanoke trail club for making such a livable little vacation home on the AT!
At one point as I traversed a rhododendron grove I heard the distinct hoot of the barred owl - ""Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all?"" 
A mile and a half of dirt switchbacks descended to Pearisburg from Angel's Rest, a large boulder with a view of the NewbRiver valley containing the towns of Pearisburg and Narrows. That dumped me on a mountain road that led a mile down to Pearisburg, conveniently depositing me at a Dairy Queen. 
Full of burgers and milkshake, I resupplied at Food Lion and found the post office was closed. As in, closed since May with all operations moved to the Narrows post office five miles away. Strange, since our packages were reported to have been delivered to Pearisburg. Sunshine paid a shuttle to take him to Narrows to retrieve his packages. I was able to simply call to forward my package home. It contains my old backpack, in case I had wanted to switch back after trying out the CDT for a week. The new pack works well so there was no need to physically accept the package. The post office will forward an unopened general delivery package to another post office at no cost. A feature thruhikers often use to ""bounce"" supplies ahead until they need them. 
We took the road out of town and picked up the trail at Pearisburg cemetery, then followed it across a highway bridge over the New River, passing an old Studebaker outside a little repair shop.
The last six miles to Rice Field shelter were almost all uphill. While not a hard climb, it was late afternoon and it was hot, humid, and sweaty. The very opposite of how it felt at Woods Hole this morning.
Had to get water from a thankfully running spring before reaching the top, where there would be no water for many miles. Emerging onto the open summit of Peters Mountain called Rice Field I could see rows and rows of ridgelines to the west, all of them in West Virginia. In fact my left foot was in West Virginia.
The setting sun colored the ridges in shades of gold and copper, and highlighted tall strato-cumulus clouds that hung motionless in the calm air.","Sugar Run Rd

I was only at 3300 feet and soared above it, placing the ceiling practically on the valley floor.
The hike out went over open ridges interspersed with forest. The tall meadow grasses wet me down and scratched at my exposed arms and legs for miles, leaving me itching swollen rashes much of the day. Still, it was mostly easy grades and, where under the cover of forest, pleasant terrain. Except for a spring I didn't bother to walk downhill to examine, there is no water for a 14 mile stretch on this ridge.
Met only one person, a section hiker named Marshall who's been out for two weeks and headed to Damascus. Had a huge pack and warned me about an unafraid bear at Niday shelter and a rattlesnake at another. I have yet to see either this trip so I treated it as a promise not a threat.
Made it twelve miles to Pine Swamp shelter and ate lunch with Sunshine, who as usual got there well ahead. After he left I napped and read in the shade while the sun dried my pack and pole grips. They were pleasantly warm and dry putting them back on. Should have thought to dry my socks!
My reverie was broken when Boats appeared with a hydration pack. His wife was slacking him 27 miles from Pearisburg. For a 65-year-old he can really move. Told me how he invited all his retired friends to join him but they all have ailments, bad knees, etc. and told him he was nuts.
It was a hot one. Once I got down to a creek I splashed my face and head to cool down. Did it again a few miles later. I was tempted to just lie down in the water, but I didn't want to wet my then-dry clothes. 
They didn't stay dry though, as I sweated out several gallons it seemed climbing a thousand feet to Bailey Gap Shelter. The climb wasn't intrinsically tough, it was just the heat and humidity. So I rested again, until Boats caught up with me and I followed him out. Caught up and chatted as we traversed miles of rocks over another ridgeline and through more head-high thickets of prickers and grasses.
Boats' wife, Vicki, met us near a road and gave me my first trail magic in the 665 miles of this trip so far: a Mountain Dew and homemade cookies. Such a treat! Thank you Vicki!
The last five miles were over easy trail that eventually plummeted 1700 feet down to War Spur Shelter, though with a steep tricky section of grasses obscuring rutted and rocky trail, requiring slow going. But before I got too far I rested again at a beautiful view called Wind Rock where the sun, now low in the sky, helped dry me out. 
Down at the shelter section hiker Jukebox was hanging out with Sunshine. A Wilmington, North Carolina calculus teacher, Jukebox is using his summer to hike all of Virginia. He got bluff-charged by a momma bear coming down to the shelter when he accidentally treed a cub. Had to bushwhack well around her and find his way back to the trail. 
A rabbit decided we were non-threatening enough to eat its dinner fifteen feet away from the picnic table for quite awhile. It didn't spook until it heard my flip-flops.","Rice Field Shelter
",War Spur Shelter,"Jul 09, Thu",25.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629170,"It was the worst of times, it was the... well, let's leave it at that. It was a lo-oong day in every way.
Jukebox's friend hiked in from Pearisburg, over thirty miles, and arrived sometime during the night. He was cowboy camping in the field in the morning. Of course all I knew last night was someone was walking around with a headlamp, presumably looking for a bush, before I dozed off again. 
He and Jukebox were still asleep when I left at 7. Earlier than usual, because Sunshine and I planned to go 28 miles to a shelter near Dragon's Tooth, since the next closer shelter was only 18. We didn't think about the humidity.
It wasn't long before I hit the first climb, 1700 feet, to a featureless ridge. Within minutes of an otherwise moderate climb I was soaked with sweat and, panting, stopping for a break. And I only slowed down from there.  Instead of getting fifteen miles in by noon as hoped, I didn't even manage ten. 
As I distracted myself from rising heat and oppressive humidity, I noted many rhododendrons are still blooming. A little funny to remember the throngs of people visiting Roan on a particular weekend for ""the""  rhododendron bloom. You could hike practically anywhere in the southern Appalachians and see them for over a month.
After struggling over a bumpy ridge, the trail dropped to a valley, only to release me into sunny pastures and meadows. Beautiful and full of wildflowers, but also totally exposed and hotter than ever. I looked forward to escaping into the shadowy forest as the dry grasses and stalks scraped at my legs and arms. 
Before I did, I made the mistake of wading twenty feet off the narrow path into the meadow to photograph a flower. When I reached a rare creek to gather water and cool down, I found five ticks on my legs. A personal record!
Another long, hot, sweaty, panting, climb to another featureless and waterless ridge. I couldn't drink enough and couldn't carry enough. By the time I reached Niday Shelter on the other end of the ridge I was looking forward to a mid-afternoon nap. Sunshine beat me to it. He was already sprawled out on the wood floor in the glorious shade. After eating lunch I lay on the hard floor myself and crashed. I woke up two hours later to Jukebox arriving with his trademark tunes blaring. We had only gotten 18 miles, and it was already six o'clock.
Jukebox told us his friend had looked pale and nearly collapsed in a pasture. Diagnosing dehydration, he left him some water and a salt tablet and hiked on. (He learned by text the friend recovered and hiked on.) That these three, all about 20 years my juniors, were struggling mightily today makes me feel at least it isn't age that wore me down so much. But I still wasn't sure I'd make it ten more miles.
We could have stopped, but after a long nap and in the cool evening it was easier. I soaked my head, arms, and legs at a stream to make evaporative cooling work for me. During another 1500 foot climb God mercifully sent a brief, light rain to tamp down the humidity.
This last ridge, after finally attaining the summit, was grassy with a smooth, gently graded path. It led to the Audie Murphy monument, honoring World War II's most decorated soldier. I arrived just as the sun set directly behind it. Admirers had left flags, dogtags, a helmet, and other mementos around it.
I hiked in the gathering darkness for almost two more hours. Heard animals small and large crashing nearby but could see nothing. The lamp's battery died down and I had to awkwardly attach my external battery while hiking. The cord came down past my nose and clearly wasn't designed for this.
Finally at 10:30 - 15 1/2 hours and 29 miles later (including a long side trail to the shelter) - I reached Pickle Branch Shelter in total darkness. Sunshine was still awake. No one else was here. It didn't take long to fall asleep.","War Spur Shelter
",Pickle Branch Shelter,"Jul 10, Fri",28.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629172,"If yesterday was almost everything I don't want in a hiking day, today was a model day.
Yes, the ridge started out bumpy and rocky on the way to Dragon's Tooth. It wasn't really that bad, but I'd not eaten quite enough for breakfast so I was coasting on fumes for a couple miles before I realized it. What was very helpful was the cool breeze that blew almost continuously across the ridge. The humidity felt far lower. Still, I arrived at Dragon's Tooth in a hangry mood and devoured a bag of Chex mix before trusting myself to say much to Sunshine or anyone.
On the way in I spotted a deer. Not unusual, except it was poised in the center of a huge rock slab jutting off one side of the ridge. A viewpoint to the eastern ridges. It froze when it saw I'd caught it taking in the view. The sightseeing deer then bounded off twenty feet, hoping it was now invisible, and eyed me. Until gradually it ambled down out of sight below the ridge.
Dragon's Tooth, part of Virginia's popular Triple Crown loop trail along with McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs, is a 30-40 foot tall stone edifice - the edge of a metamorphic upheaval long broken off in most places. It's a relatively easy scramble up the narrow spine to the narrower peak. But quite dizzying to look down. On one side is the ridge and milling dayhikers. In the other is the sharp drop off down to the valley many hundreds of feet. Throw in the gusty breeze and I felt a lot more comfortable with both hands on the rock. 
A grizzled section hiker named Funguy came in with some very worn-looking equipment. He hikes every year, but attempted to thruhike in 1982. It wasn't clear how far he got, except that he said he stopped in Helen, Georgia (just days into the hike), met some residents who had hiked into town years earlier and loved it so much they decided to stay put, and ended up taking 45 zeroes there. To his credit, he did eventually escape the black hole.
Very tricky descent from Dragon's Tooth to the road. Over a mile of ledges and boulders requiring hands as well as feet. Going down steeply is easier on the lungs and heart, but a lot harder on everything else!
Nearing the road I saw a trail maintainer! It was Saturday, but still I haven't seen any since Georgia. He was cutting thickly overgrown vegetation a few hundred yards above VA 624. With hand clippers! Now that's a lot of work. 
As we reached the road, what makes this a model day began to come together. 
Step 1: nice weather
Step 2: iconic landmark(s)
Step 3: food
There's a convenience store less than half a mile off trail here. One that makes breakfast sandwichs, burgers, and pizza. And breakfast pizza, with scrambled eggs on it! A couple hours went by sitting at a shaded table outside the door consuming sundry delectables after three long hot days in the wilderness. Even better, as we left to start road walking the half mile back in full sun, a pickup offered us a ride! We threw our packs in and rode in the back, wind whipping our hair and mocking the sun's heat.
We had an easy ridge walk six miles over to Catawba. The cool breeze remained, and the humidity and temperature were noticeably lower than yesterday. While crossing fields, the thin ribbon of trail showed parched, cracked earth between the thick meadow grasses. It's clearly been dry here for awhile. 
We left the AT on a mile-long side trail to the village of Catawba. That plus another tick-infested field crossing and a road walk brought us to The Home Place restaurant, famous trail-wide for unlimited family-style Southern comfort food. Remember Step 3 again. We arrived comfortably at 3:58 and noted happily that the sign announced Saturday hours of 4-8pm.
But the parking lot was almost empty. A woman pulling out asked if we had placed an order. She explained they were doing pickup only, and only for preorders, and they'd changed hours to 12-4. Oh, no! Disaster! Our world began to spiral out of control. Carefully laid plans, not to mention icky ticks, highway traffic, and hot sun had all been for naught! Okay, maybe a bit melodramatic. So we did what any thruhiker would do: we begged, we yogied, and we hoped. We'd be happy to purchase any leftovers, we pleaded. And this wonderful human being said she'd see what she could do. She got out of her car, went in, and fixed us up a ""vegetable platter"" of sides and brought out a bunch of containers, a half gallon of sweet tea, and two cups with ice. 
Ice! 
We thanked her profusely, and carried our haul to a picnic table. Turned out there were some biscuits and chicken tenders in there, as well as baked beans, cole slaw, mashed potatoes and green beans. It was a happy moment. And soon it was all gone.
Very full, we managed to hitch a ride the mile and a half down route 311 to the parking lot at the AT trailhead. Torey, a guy from Swarthmore in my neck of Pennsylvania, passed us, swung around at the next intersection, and came back to get us. His parents live nearby and he frequently hikes McAfee Knob. (For the record, our side trail to Catawba was as long as the mile of AT we missed going down to the parking lot. And much more overgrown. And probably the original AT. But who's counting!)
We waddled the four miles up to McAfee Knob, bellies full to bursting (remember Step 3), passing many dayhikers coming down. The trail was very dusty and crossed a lot of bedrock.
Not too crowded at McAfee Knob itself considering it was Saturday. A national park ranger named Brian Wilson was on duty, one of only two field rangers assigned to the park service's Appalachian National Scenic Trail unit. The park service owns a lot of land around McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs and he spends much of his field time working this busy stretch. A really down-to-earth and friendly guy, he was in the thick of all the closures and reopenings the park and forest services have gone through. ""I've been on a lot of zoom calls"" he smiled. Some of the pressure to close had come from local trail clubs, who were barred from maintaining the trail and wanted it closed to prevent unmanaged use issues. Also at least one trail town, Damascus, wanted to limit the numbers of people coming through. Ultimately the park service closed the McAfee Knob stretch because all the people who would normally have been shopping decided to take up hiking instead. By itself this was fine - no one at NPS wanted to guard the trailhead and turn people away. But it threatened to strain rescue efforts. In a normal time many, many people have to be treated or carried out from this area due to twisted ankles, dehydration, or worse, and the number of newbie hikers was exacerbating that. But still the park service decided against closing the whole AT. In all a very measured and logical approach, far from the reflexive black-and-white mindset many governments and organizations embraced.
A thruhiker named Lone Wolf appeared soon after I arrived. He's from the Williamsport area in Pennsylvania. Calls himself Pennsylvania Dutch and has the accent to prove it. Started a month ago and is moving quickly. 
We were treated to a majestic sunset on the horizon, opposite the famous overhanging rock. Sunrise is supposed to be even more dramatic, but we hiked down after sunset to the shelter for late dinner. Many folks were camped nearby with fires going, planning to ascend again before dawn.","Pickle Branch Shelter
",Campbell Shelter (Pig Farm campsite),"Jul 11, Sat",17
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629176,"Waking at 4:45 to climb back up to McAfee Knob for sunrise didn't happen. Surprise! No worries, today's focus was getting to town. Only 15 miles away.
I was last out and caught up with Lone Wolf at Tinker Cliffs. Some backpackers said he was ""really flying"". Since he introduced himself as being Pennsylvania Dutch I suggested he call himself Flying Dutchman. ""Lone Wolf"" came from hiking alone for the first month, but he's unlikely to be alone from now on.
There was actually water at Lambert Meadows, unlike when I came through here in early September a couple years ago. The ridge walk wasn't nearly as bad as I remembered. The weather was sunny, hot but not extreme, and only moderately humid. Still, the ridge went on for far longer than it seemed it should have. I crossed under five separate high-voltage power lines within a few miles. Roanoke/Daleville must be a major power distribution point.
As the ridge finally ended and Dutchman/Lone Wolf and I headed down to the road, we reached a wide concrete bridge over a creek. People were thigh-deep in the creek wrestling a huge fallen tree. An older guy supervising explained they were clearing a logjam that had blocked the culverts under the bridge and caused flooding. He turned out to be Homer Witcher, who had shuttled me when I did this section two years ago. He and his wife Theresa thruhiked many years ago with their 8 and 11 year-old kids. That 8 year-old son is now in his mid-20s and helping move the log. That 11 year-old daughter is now busy with a newborn 2 month-old at home, who Homer proudly announced has already traveled 120 miles on the AT!
I stopped to help move the log and ended up in the creek for an hour and a half swinging an axe, levering a rock bar, wrestling a hand winch, and deadlifting a huge stump onto the concrete culvert. We couldn't push the tree any further. The next storm surge will push it through the culvert. I appreciate more than ever the exhausting work of trail maintenance. Folks like Homer, Theresa and their family deserve our utmost thanks for all they do to keep the trail clear and usable. 
I left smelling like creek water. I didn't know it was possible to stink more than I had after several days sweating in high humidity, but it kicked it up to a whole new level!
After a burger and frosty stop at Wendy's, where I walked through the drive through (hint: just go to the window and ignore the cars, they will help you), I got to chat with my family back at the motel in the late afternoon. They are headed to the Shore soon for some summer fun. I miss them terribly. So thankful for video chat so I can actually see their faces.
Just hit the one-third mark of the AT. It seems to be passing so quickly. As they say, the days are long but the years are short.
Lone Wolf almost got us kicked out of the Three Lil' Pigs at dinner by asking for cheese on his barbeque sandwich. Apparently that is a major faux pas round these parts!","Campbell Shelter (Pig Farm campsite)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629258,"We crossed the interstate to get a big breakfast at Angelle's diner. Walking through the concrete jungle of ramps and bridges with tractor-trailers speeding by made me wish I was climbing a 3000-foot mountain. I feel safer among the bears! Didn't leave the Super 8 until after 11, trying to catch up on my journal while I had service. Never enough time in town, somehow!
A rule of thumb for thruhikers is ""ten by twelve"". It means knock out ten miles before noon to take the pressure off the afternoon. Depending on their pace some shoot for 12 by 12 or 15 by 12. Today, I got in a whopping 2 by 12. What a start! And only 23 left this afternoon...
Landmark wildlife day: my first bear sighting! I heard the crash downhill. It was strangely drawn out, more than a deer. By the time I turned my head I could see the black furry beast, a medium-sized fellow, running parallel  along the hill below the trail, in the opposite direction. Within seconds he slipped below the curve of the slope.
Later I did a double take at a five-foot-long black rat snake coiled near the trail. He saw me first though, and was already slithering toward a hollow tree flanking the trail. His body serpentined up over the bark and entered a crack into the hollow. 
Also stumbled over a turtle on the trail in two different places. They grumpily withdrew into their shells and stared morosely out of the crevice, satisfied they were beyond harm and content to wait out the intrusion.
Crossed paths with an older hiker from Pennsylvania who I met at the Super 8 yesterday, dayhiking southbound. Also a soft-spoken young bearded section hiker from Charlottesville who called himself American Chestnut, out for two weeks heading south.
The trail stayed mainly in forest after winding away from the interstate and briefly crowning a hilly meadow. The easy grades and smooth terrain felt like Shenandoah. Crossing over the Blue Ridge Parkway multiple times strengthened the similarity. Just missing the key ingredient: wayside grills!
In the evening I caught up with Lone Wolf having dinner at a stream. There's no water at Cove Mountain Shelter where we planned to stay, so I carried extra from here for over three miles.
Cresting Cove Mountain and descending the north side I caught a beautiful, clear sunset. Blue hills. Orange, pink, and gold lining.

",Cove Mountain Shelter,"Jul 13, Mon",25
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629260,"Out early by 7:15 to tackle a day of big climbs over Apple Orchard Mountain, and to take in the falls below it.
Cove Mountain Shelter was dry, so I walked three miles to Jennings Creek before filling up, fortunately downhill. As I filtered on the stony bank under a road bridge, the morning sun illuminated wisps of fog floating above the creek. 
I grabbed some ripe raspberries as I left for second breakfast.
Around 10 I reached the next shelter where two section hikers were just getting up. Guru, a skinny kid from Pittsburgh, is out for a month. Another young guy is out for a couple weeks. Said he needs a trail name, before whipping out a bag of only green gummi bears he bought at a campground store nearby (now how did I miss that opportunity?). Too late, after I'd hiked on, I figured he should go by Green Gummi, maybe Double G for short. People have been named for less!
The climbs up Apple Orchard were not bad, even though over 3000 feet combined, and I made it fifteen miles by 1, my best start in awhile. I turned off the AT onto the 1.1 mile side trail down the mountain to Apple Orchard Falls. It was steeper and farther down than I expected, but I was now committed. At the main falls I took a cold and thunderous shower under the 200 foot cascades. It felt invigorating. By the time I'd eaten lunch I and my clothes were mostly dry. A pair of dayhikers traded photos with me, and found out we'd both stayed at Woods Hole, where they'd met Tortoise. 
The Blue Ridge here is much narrower than in North Carolina. Once I gained the summit of Apple Orchard Mountain, at 4225 feet one of the highest in the region, I could see the broad Virginia Piedmont stretching east towards the sea on one side, and the Great Valley separating me from the ridges that run the length of Virginia and beyond on the other. 
Took a break at Thunder Hill Shelter late in the afternoon, aiming to tent in a few miles since the shelters were oddly spaced. There I learned by text that Sunshine and Lone Wolf were going all the way to the James River, where a road would take them into Glasgow for the night. That was still fifteen more miles for me and it was far too late to consider covering it even if I felt pretty good. It hadn't been overly hot or humid today, and I was managing to drink and eat enough. Still, after returning from the falls I managed only ten miles over 5 hours before I stopped for the evening at Marble Spring, 25 miles from where I started but seven miles short of town. 
Marble Spring is a grassy clearing where apparently a shelter once stood. The tent site, however, was stony and the dirt hard as concrete. Only the fourth night I've used the tent. An ex-Army guy from Philly was setting up his tent as I arrived, and his large excited dog came running at me like he wanted to bowl me over. They've been hiking south from Pine Grove Furnace in Pennsylvania for the last five weeks with no deadline or destination. He just received a degree in landscape architecture and is at a crossroads in his life.
Saw a number of deer today, as I have every day for the last couple of weeks. They seem to be getting less skittish of me. One actually followed me as I hiked on so it could quickly return to browsing near the trail. At Marble Spring a rabbit was so bold it hopped only a few feet up the water trail at a time, enough to keep out of reach, but never scampering off.
When I got back to my tent I heard a whippoorwill again. It feels more like wilderness here.","Cove Mountain Shelter
",Marble Spring campsite,"Jul 14, Tue",24.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629268,"I woke to the predawn light and some crunching sounds in the brush. A deer was browsing several yards from my tent, oblivious or uncaring of my presence.
Ate my last apple for breakfast - bringing fresh fruit is a psychological boost if nothing else - and set off early to reach the road for a 10 o'clock pickup by Charlie from the Glasgow hostel. 
The trail wound almost entirely downhill for seven miles, one of the easiest days I've ever hiked. I sketched out ideas as I walked for hiking with my kids when I reach Pennsylvania. 
I thought about my decision to stop short of town yesterday, which effectively separates me from Sunshine and Lone Wolf, probably for good. Practically speaking I couldn't have reached it at a reasonable hour. More importantly, I would have made myself miserable. And felt pressure to hike out the next morning, and to stretch again to reach Waynesboro, and so on. I knew the path that led to. I've been down it many times. Most of my section hikes went like that. I'd push myself to reach town late in the day, rush to do chores, and hike out early the next morning with another ambitious goal, the humidity, rain, or how I was feeling be damned. But then I was on a tight schedule, even if self-imposed. Now, as a thruhiker, the end is far enough off that there are no critical intermediate deadlines. As long as I average enough miles I will make it. And I can maintain that average without dashing to town. In fact, as much as I've been motivated by town stops, I find them less important if I listen to my body and drink, eat, and rest when needed. And take the time to enjoy the little and the large experiences along the way. So in that sense stopping at the falls yesterday and falling short of town was exactly the right approach for me.
So back to the trail. At Matt's Creek Shelter, a couple miles from the James River, I met Shifty and Buffy, a German couple. The first foreigners I've met on trail this year. They started in March and took six weeks off staying in Franklin before continuing. Their visa expires soon so they have given up on thruhiking and are just doing what they please. 
Soon after, a train of dayhikers coming from the road passed me. Including 9 men with the Wednesday Club from Lynchburg out for their weekly hike. 
The James River is deserving of the name, broad and majestic, ensconced among green hills. And the iron girder footbridge is the longest on the AT by far. Signs tell you not to jump off the bridge. On popular days there's a line. 
Charlie from Stanimals Hostel in Glasgow pulled up minutes after I arrived at the road. Sunshine and Lone Wolf piled out, all aglow with town food. I wished them well, doubting I'll ever see them again. I made them promise to find me in Maine when they're done and do trail magic!
When Charlie found out I was from the Valley Forge area I learned he was the same Charlie Rogers who led my local boy scout Council until a couple years ago. What a coincidence! He thruhiked last year as Pilgrim, thanks partly to his tag number 1620 and partly to his Massachusetts birthplace (he traces his family back to several of the Mayflower families). He took his time, starting in March and ending in November on Mt. Greylock in Massachusetts after a flip-flop. He took over the hostel for this season when another manager pulled out, having struck up a relationship with the owner, Adam Stanley, while recuperating for two weeks during his thruhike with shin splints and other foot pain. 
Showered and threw the laundry in after borrowing some loaner clothes. Typically these are either humongous or petite. Rarely any sizes that fit a typical thruhiker. So I grabbed a safety pin from my repair kit and cinched in a pair of shorts that six months ago may have been merely baggy on me but were now literally falling off my hips. Then I walked down the road towards town.
Glasgow is the only town on the AT with a dinosaur. A fifteen foot high plaster monument of a brontosaurus graces the empty lot across from Scotto's, the only and very busy restaurant in town. Most of the buildings around it sit unused. But Scotto's is a treasure - not only does it have hearty Italian subs and dinners, it has milkshakes. Automatic five stars in my book.
Several others at the hostel today. Flashlight is headed southbound. Brookie is a Nobo section hiker from McAfee Knob. Lucky Charms, a stringbean and very Irish-looking kid, came in late. Got his name from all the good luck he's had on trail. Finding things he needed, like shoes(!), but especially his uncanny ability to yogi food and gifts from strangers.","Marble Spring campsite
",US 501 James River Bridge,"Jul 15, Wed",7.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629344,"Bade farewell to Charlie after he cooked us a pancake breakfast. What a great host! He dropped me off with Flashlight, a Pennsylvanian now from Orlando, who headed south over the James River bridge, and Brookie, who opted to slackpack up the mountain northbound.  I wasn't slackpacking, but he fell back almost immediately and I walked the morning alone.
I hiked up into a cloud. Wet grass soaked my feet, trees dripped and soaked my head, water droplets condensed on me. Technically I guess this counts as precipitation of some sort. Eskimos have a thousand words for snow. Hikers need a thousand words for rain. This one certainly soaked me more efficiently than most cloudbursts manage.
It was almost 3000 vertical feet up Bluff Mountain. But it was fogged in of course so no views. The climb wasn't too difficult given the cooling effect of my personal cloud.
I stumbled upon another turtle today, eyeing me cautiously from within his armor. And a little later a deer that took a few steps away then simply watched me. They seem rather accustomed to hikers here.
Stopped at Punchbowl Shelter for lunch after ten miles. Within minutes of laying down to nap I started hearing odd noises coming from what looked like a nearby clearing. I thought it might be hikers arriving, then some kind of animal. I wanted to rest, but my curiosity made me walk over there. It turned out to be a pond full of bullfrogs, croaking at one another in some cacophonous concert. It went on for only a few minutes before it faded out to sporadic croaks.
The wildlife kingdom was done putting on its show. As I left the shelter a doe burst across the trail, followed by a white-speckled fawn, and another doe. They loitered ten yards away waiting for me to move on so they could browse in peace. 
Caught up again with Brookie, who had met Charlie at the Blue Ridge Parkway crossing a mile back and gotten his regular pack. It was enormous, with equipment strapped above and below it. So tall it came down to his mid-thigh and stuck out above his head. Brookie, I would estimate, is 6' 2"". He trudged slowly under the burden. I could see why that slackpack was so attractive.
It was all downhill to Brown Mountain Creek. Here signs tell of a rural black community that lived here after the Civil War until they sold their land to the forest service in the 1920s. A stone chimney and some piles of stone appear to be all that remains. 
AWOL advertises the shelter here as having a swimming hole, but the creek is shallow as far as I could see.  Disappointing! I was looking forward to a swim on this hot and humid day. I splashed off the sweat and cooled myself down. The humidity is heavier at lower elevations like this, where the mountain breezes don't reach. 
After eating some dinner I decided to hike a few more miles up a huge climb to Bald Knob. At 4000 feet it should be cooler and less humid.
The climb itself was not bad, but it teased me with a dozen or more false summits, making it seem to last far longer. The mountain is covered with dense understory vegetation, most of it invasive species I would bet. Not a pleasant forest that beckons you onwards, rather one that makes you think of stinging nettles and poison ivy.
Finally at the summit - which is ironically not bald at all - I found a tentsite. The only piece of open ground on this four mile climb. I set up the tent and hung my clothes to dry in the wonderfully stiff breeze, but drips began hitting the tent and I pulled everything inside. Guess there could be weather tonight.","US 501 James River Bridge
",Bald Knob,"Jul 16, Thu",24.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629350,"Cool night on Bald Knob. I read later the summit was still open about fifteen years ago. The forest has grown up quickly since then without active suppression. Apparently many balds have been let go like this, including in the Smokies. Whether they started naturally or through grazing by Indians or settlers, its a clear loss to visitors to let them revegetate. Though I appreciate the difficulty and expense it would take to manage them. It's what makes places like Roan and Max Patch so special.
More of the same hot, humid, mostly sunny weather. The early morning was relatively cool and pleasant but the middle of the day was tough. My strength ebbed, water consumption soared, and minor climbs left me panting and annoyed.
Ran into Banger, a fiftyish guy section hiking Damascus to Harper's Ferry who seems like the type who just lives on the trail. Also a college student from Mary Baldwin in Staunton studying Environmental Biology, out for a few days. He hikes the area often and gave me some good local info on the sights.
Hit Spy Rock in the middle of the day and laid on the enormous boulder with a 360 degree view, trying to nap. Of course nature had other ideas. I felt the first drop hit my head, then watched ripples forming in the puddles on the rock. Reluctantly, sluggishly, I pulled on the pack and started moving as the rain shower cooled me off.
Other than that brief shower, though, there was precious little water to be found. Most of the sources were trickles too shallow to fill my water bag. That's the irony of summer hiking - water runs low when you need it most.
At The Priest shelter a middle-aged couple came in for an overnight. The woman complained of very sore feet. Her wise husband chose to reprioritize his camp chores to move ""foot massage"" to number one. When asked about my small pack I joked how I was eating my four days of food in three. Before I realized how it had come across they were offering me food. When I went to get water I came back to find I had inadvertently Yogi-ed a couple granola bars from them. 
It's true that I have been eating more than I planned. I've gobbled up my lunch and dinner items like ham, peanut butter, and M&Ms while leaving snacks like granola bars untouched. I'll have to be more realistic about the types of food I carry to make sure I feel satisfied. No need to compound heat and dehydration with not eating enough.
After The Priest summit the trail drops 3100 feet in a little over three miles. Steep and rocky for the first mile, it eventually gave way to mostly dirt switchbacks, but still quite steep. The descent was so sharp that 2500 feet down my ears popped.
Crossing the Tye River on a beautiful suspension footbridge, I regained 1000 feet of elevation to Harpers Creek Shelter, perched above the creek in a hollow just off trail. Two tenters nearby seemed to be trying to roast a buffalo, there was so much smoke billowing down the valley. I could smell it many minutes before I arrived.
It was already dusk, and with the shelter to myself I hung clothes up to dry, ever hopeful. It was a pleasant evening. Even the bugs gave me a break for a change.","Bald Knob

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629351,"Decided to push for town (Waynesboro) today. I knew I'd reach the only logical shelter, Wolfe, by late in the afternoon and my stomach would decide to hike the additional five miles anyway. So I planned for it upfront. 
Didn't get out until 8, thanks to rolling over and sleeping in another hour. With a huge climb to start the day I wasn't very eager to jump up and hit the trail. But after a good breakfast - applesauce and a honey bun - and importantly a lot of water I felt invigorated.
The climb was no joke. On my section hikes I would often ask thruhikers what the toughest climb was (this before we reached New Hampshire), and they almost always answered ""The Priest"". Which I take to mean Three Ridges since NOBOs descend the Priest. Well, here I am! 
I knocked out a thousand feet last night to reach the shelter and I'm glad I did. The next thousand weren't too bad. But I was fresh, the air was still cool, and the trail was mostly dirt and not too steep. The last thousand were the killer. Rocky, rooty, steep, overgrown at times, temperature and humidity rising. I was a sweaty and annoyed mess by the time I summited. Typically I'd let off steam by sounding my barbaric ""Yawp"" o'er the rooftops of the world after such a climb (apologies to Whitman). But there were dayhikers about so I couldn't even do that. Well, if I were total hiker trash maybe, but LNT #7 applies here.
Thus began a stretch full of dayhikers and weekenders between Three Ridges summit (reached far more easily from a parking lot to the north) and Humpback Rocks. The trail was very narrow thanks to overgrowth and sidehill carve-outs, so I spent a lot of time patiently stepping aside and exchanging pleasantries. After seeing practically no one the last couple of days I was peopled out.
Pennsylvania has got nothing on Virginia's rocks. Most of Three Ridges and Humpback were covered with rocks, small boulders, and those small loose stones that love to send you back half a step when climbing or skiing downhill when descending.
There were occasional views, but if I'm being honest they didn't do much for me. I wanted to cover some miles, and not only was it pretty hazy but the landscape was largely farmland. I know, I'm spoiled from mountains-to-the-horizon southern Blue Ridge views. 
What I longed for was water, and there wasn't enough of that. Most sources were a trickle, difficult to fill my water bag. And I sucked down whatever I could get today. More than once I nursed a cup of water the last several miles to a source. You know it's humid by the amount of water you're taking in. That and the growing salt stains on my pack and shirt from all the sweat pouring out.
Today's highlight was seeing a momma bear and cub walking slowly above me as I descended from Humpback. Momma was following her cub, in the opposite direction and about fifteen yards uphill. She gave me a brief glance and kept sauntering along, crunching through the leaves. I managed to get video through the trees which I'll post on the linked Instagram. 
This morning I fell off my pace dramatically in the Three Ridges climb, but somehow I managed to pour on (literally) the miles the rest of the day. I covered 27 miles in ten hours and reached Rockfish Gap at 6:15. No lunch break, just shoving snacks in my mouth all day. Just my luck the food stand at Rockfish Gap - King's Gourmet Popcorn - had closed early. But Stanimals sent out a shuttle driver and I was in town and inhaling burgers, iced tea, and a milkshake within the hour. 
A 60-year-old southbound section hiker from western Pennsylvania, another Tortoise, is here. Also a group with a large friendly dog (as in, likes to jump on me) in a private room, and a Kentuckian my age named Tryton who appeared late in the evening and has a wife and daughter in Turkey of all places.
Taking my second zero day tomorrow. I have some chores to do, including replacing my trekking pole tips. And after 80 miles in three days in the heat and humidity I think I've earned a rest. Shenandoah beckons, and I look forward to carrying little food, hitting the Wayside grills every day, and dialing back the miles a little.","Harpers Creek Shelter
",Rockfish Gap (Waynesboro),"Jul 18, Sat",27
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629416,"Actually relaxed today. But I still got my chores done. Replaced my trekking pole tips at Rockfish Gap Outfitter - after 1800 miles they were worn down to nubs. Practically useless trying to dig in on hills or stabilize against a rock. Resupplied at Kroger. Fruitlessly shopped at a Family Dollar and ""neighborhood"" Walmart for replacement shorts. The liner in my current pair is falling apart which I fear will lead to chafing. Hope they last to the next town. Plus I did lots of paperwork to renew my life insurance policy, something I had overlooked before starting the hike. Ah, the joys of middle age! Not something the college crowd is thinking about. I've no intention of biting the bullet on this hike - that would require an unlikely combination of creativity and stupidity - but at least my wife can rest easier! Fortunately thruhiking doesn't rank with skydiving as a high risk activity so I am still eminently insurable.
Ming's Garden all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet has reopened, and I did some major damage to the sushi bar. Nearly all restaurants so far have been open and had seating. The major exception being fast food, many of which serve only through the drive-thru. Usually they are accommodating to pedestrians, having you walk right to the window rather than stand in line with cars. In fact the weight sensor in the pavement wouldn't register a person anyway. Kline's dairy bar, near Stanimals hostel, is different. The woman taking orders outside on the car line insisted that I follow the cars, ostensibly so they wouldn't mix up the orders. She was just writing them on paper though and handing them off to a girl, so it would have been easy enough to mark mine as a ""walk-up"". My mother sensibly taught me not to play in traffic, so I took a seat on a bench outside and waited for the car I was ""following"" to be served. This wasn't good enough for the order-taker, who shooed me off the bench lest I attract a crowd (no other pedestrians in sight). In her mind it was safer that I stand in a traffic lane than sit alone on a bench, because Covid. Irrational, yes, but there's another point. Only in car-centric America could people think it's okay to provide for drive-thru service only, as if pedestrians don't exist. Not very environmentally friendly, not good for health, not good for the poor, all things we claim to value. The trail is one of the few institutions that makes little accomodation for car culture. It celebrates nature, promotes good health, is open to all and, despite what vendors may claim, requires little investment. Shout out to Hardee's, by the way, for taking orders inside even though seating was closed off. See, that wasn't so hard. I will say Kline's has great milkshakes, so it was easier to put up with the nonsense.
At the hostel Triton and another guest were grilling shish-ka-bobs. Triton is the guy who started the ""Still on the AT"" Facebook group for hikers to share information when established AT groups started censoring discussions that didn't start with ""Get off the trail"". Now it's the go-to forum for anyone looking for useful information on actual trail conditions. It was helpful for me in monitoring when was a reasonable time to start. Triton has been hiking to Harpers Ferry since March after thruhiking in 2011. He's smelling all the roses and taking at least a triple zero here. He has a wife and young daughter in southeastern Turkey, and is waiting for restrictions to relax so he can fly there.
Tortoise returned after a 19-mile slackpack from Reeds Gap. He helped rescue a woman suffering from heat exhaustion. The heat is no joke!Somehow the day slipped by quickly though I feel like I did little. It was a lazy Sunday. Probably won't have any more like it until I get close to home in eastern Pennsylvania, when I'll be taking a week or so off trail to vacation with the family.","Rockfish Gap (Waynesboro)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629417,"I was awake for awhile in the middle of the night, so I turned over a few times this morning before dragging myself out of bed. Not sure if my zero day rested me or drained my energy. I downed nearly a half gallon of OJ I'd bought yesterday. I guess my body needed something. What it didn't crave was a big breakfast, so I finished off a leftover breakfast biscuit from the four-person family breakfast deal I'd gotten yesterday morning.
Cora dropped me back at Rockfish Gap and I headed into Shenandoah National Park, self-registering my backcountry permit at a kiosk on the park boundary along the trail. I almost immediately passed an older and very friendly section hiker intending to hike the 100+ miles of the park, aiming for the first shelter seven miles in. 
The miles passed slowly as the trail rolled up and down over very dry terrain. Never very steep. But for the heat it would have been quite easy. With the heat, it was an effort, and I tried to get lost in my thoughts to help the time pass. 
On Bears Den Mountain's open summit there is a radio tower, and the faded remnants of a circle of tractor seats someone installed decades ago. I've been here three times in the last three years and each time more are falling apart. 
As I headed downhill I spied a solar charger in the middle of the trail. Did the owner go south or north? It looked like it hadn't been there long, and I hadn't passed any southbounders, but with this dry weather who can tell. I put it in my pocket to deliver to the next shelter. 
Minutes later a dayhiker approached climbing the mountain. He had just a trekking pole and a water bottle. I exchanged pleasantries and was about to move on when he asked, oh by the way, had I seen a solar charger? I happily reunited him with the device, which had landed face up and gotten a good charge in the sun. 
He turned out to be section hiking, a young guy just out of college from northern Virginia. Started at Three Ridges and ""walking home"" as he said. He too stopped at the first shelter. Since the shelter was a ways off trail I sat on a boulder in the shade and ate lunch. I had a warm soda I'd packed out and some of the tea I'd filled my bottles with. But I didn't think to get water since it was well off trail. 
That was a mistake, as I realized several miles later that I was in a twelve mile waterless stretch. I had to make my last quart of tea last. If was mid-afternoon, the hottest time of day, and the sweat poured off my forehead during even mild climbs, or any exertion in an exposed area. When I took out my phone to consult the guide the sweat dripped liberally onto the screen to the point I was afraid I'd damage it.
But I kept on, just more slowly to conserve energy and water. There were no real views or good spots to rest. Even the overlook on Skyline Drive was impeded by shrubs and young trees, as if the park had no plans to maintain the views.
At Blackrock Gap I crossed a major milestone: I've now hiked every bit of the AT northbound. Although I'd already completed it as a section hiker, this last forty miles I had sectioned southbound. It was more convenient to leave my car at Reed's Gap and hike south from Blackrock Gap. But now I've completed this last bit northbound. A meaningless achievement perhaps, but I needed a distraction from the heat. I let out a Yawp as I crossed Skyline Drive at the gap.
Around 6:30 I reached Blackrock Hut. There were already three people tenting or hammocking, the biggest shelter crowd I've encountered since the Smokies. I still had the shelter itself to myself.
Neel is a fortyish high school teacher from Millersville, Pennsylvania who teaches agriculture and grows flowers for farmers markets. He's hiking south from Harpers Ferry to Waynesboro. Kathy ""Next Tree"" is an older black woman, retired, who drove seventeen hours from her home in Oklahoma. She couldn't find a shuttle driver so she's just been hiking from her car up to the shelter. I gave her Stanimals number, I'm sure they'll help her out. She's hammocking but is afraid her untested tarp may not be stormworthy, and made plans to retreat to the shelter if it fails. Both of them have hiked a good chunk of the AT. There is also Steve, a sixty-something businessman from Georgetown in DC, hiking the park northbound to escape being cooped up in the city.
Neel was talking about walking up to Blackrock Mountain's summit this evening to see a comet - first I've heard of it. But then thunder rumbled in the west and clouds slowly rolled toward us. Looks like the comet show will have to wait.","Rockfish Gap (Waynesboro)
",Blackrock Hut,"Jul 20, Mon",20.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629418,"The sky cleared up last night so it would have been a great chance to see the comet after all. This morning I suggested Neal call himself Comet Boy, thinking it a reminder to seize opportunities when they're available. Turns out the high school in Millersville where he teaches calls its teams the Comets, so maybe it'll stick.
Shortly after leaving I passed Tomorrow, a southbound LASHer hiking from Delaware Water Gap to Georgia. We exchanged tips on water, hostels, and waysides. Seemed like he wanted to chat more but ran out of topics. Long conversations are tough when you're going in different directions. We both had to get moving while the day was relatively cool.
Stopped at Loft Mountain's campground store for an early lunch. Steve came in to shower and do laundry. I figured I'd be just as sweaty and smelly within an hour of leaving so why bother. The sun was brutal. I hung out in the shaded covering by the store until noon before ginning up the resolve to hike on.
A couple hours of unremarkable rolling hills later I ducked into Pinefield Hut for water and a rest. Laid my pack and shirt in the sun to dry off. Wish I could dry my shorts as easily. I opened the soda I'd carried seven miles from the camp store and it fizzed all over me. You'd think I'd have learned that lesson by now. I left an iced tea in the spring to cool it down. It did make a little difference, but hardly ice cold. Passed Steve on the way out. This is his stop for the night, though it's only 3. But in this heat I would probably do the same if I could afford shorter days.
Making my way to the next shelter I listened to thundering in the distance for an hour. Inevitably a storm blew through as I descended toward Powell Gap. It brought a light, refreshing shower and cooler temperatures. The shower lasted barely fifteen minutes, but the foliage was now wet, and that proceeded to soak my feet. That's the trade-off for cooler weather on a July afternoon in northern Virginia.
Arriving at Hightop Hut I considered pushing a few more miles and finding a stealth spot. After I got water and returned to the shelter though, another front blew in bringing a heavy downpour. While it only lasted thirty minutes, that was enough for me to stay put. It was already seven o'clock.
I've seen no one other than Steve, Tomorrow, and a handful of car campers and tourists near the overlooks since leaving this morning. For the last nine miles I was breaking webs, indicating no one at all has been through today. There is no one else at this shelter. I saw more backpackers in the remotest stretches of Virginia. I'm rather surprised given Shenandoah's popularity as a backpacking destination and proximity to major cities. It's mid-week, but also the middle of summer. Maybe it's just too hot for those monitoring the weather before they head out.","Blackrock Hut
",Hightop Hut,"Jul 21, Tue",21.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629430,"I double-dipped the Shenandoah waysides today, lunching at Lewis Mountain campground store and filling up at Big Meadows restaurant later. One of the joys of hiking the Shennies. 
It was pleasant hiking out this morning and I made great time to Lewis Mountain campground twelve miles away, heading over Hightop, down through Swift Run Gap, one of the two gaps where roads cross the park, and then a long gradual climb out. The trail was clear and easy walking.
While cruising along listening to an audio book I almost missed the snake in the trail. Oh, another black rat snake, I thought. Wait... no, no, no, NO, not a rat snake, definitely NOT a rat snake! It was a black rattler, sunbathing in the middle of the dirt trail. I carefully kept my distance. He didn't move, didn't rattle, but clearly was watching me. I took some pictures then gave him a wide berth.
Now amazingly, that is the first rattler I've ever seen. I've logged 3700 miles on the AT and never seen a rattler! And if I hadn't glanced down I probably would have stepped right over this one like any root in the trail without a second thought. How many have I unwittingly passed before?
By noon when I reached the campground store I was ready for second breakfast, lunch, and elevensies all at once, and purchased accordingly. The campground had showers available and it was tempting. But I figured I'd be a sweaty mess again in an hour so why bother?
Well, I was right but for the wrong reason. An hour after leaving the sky darkened and the wind whipped up. It felt great as the humidity and temperature dropped. But of course then came the rain. At first it was light and I hoped it would be like yesterday's refreshing shower. But it suddenly intensified and I belatedly donned my poncho. The rain was so heavy it quickly overwhelmed the trail and turned it into a stream. I hiked through an inch or two of water for the next five miles. The trails here are very well graded and well drained, but the storm was a monster. It would slacken for a couple minutes, then resume its furious tempo, again and again. 
Two hours later, soaked from head to toe, I reached the Big Meadows Lodge. The main restaurant was open. With my big lunch and the wet walk I didn't have a large appetite, but I nursed three scoops of Shenandoah's famous blackberry ice cream. An hour later I was shivering from the A/C, my iced tea, the ice cream, and my still-damp clothes. Outside it was no warmer. Thoughts of hypothermia gripped me. What a turnaround from the heat of a few hours ago! I had to start hiking, and quickly, to warm up.
And hike quickly I did. Full of energy, I bounded up the trail for the three or four miles to the shelter. Sugar rush? Low humidity? Cooler temperature? Rested feet? Whatever the reason, if I could bottle it I'd be rich.
I'd considered hiking to Skyland resort for a late dinner - the trifecta of thruhiking Shenandoah (or hat trick, if you prefer). But I was deterred by the unavailability of tenting nearby and the high cost of a room in the resort. So I aimed for the next shelter and planned for breakfast at Skyland.
The Rock Spring Hut turned out to be quite busy with about ten other tenters and shelter-dwellers. Most were hiking portions of the park. But one, a long gray-haired woman called Freethinker, was six weeks into  backpacking a series of blue-blaze trails. Although she thrued in 2011 with an old boyfriend, she didn't think much of the experience. Her dad, who thruhiked both the AT and PCT in the early 80s, inspired her love of backpacking and the outdoors. But she prefers the side trails - the blue-blazed trails. She goes out for a week-long loop, resupplies from her car, and goes back out again. She has favorite tenting spots on trails she's been visiting for forty years. For her it's definitely not about the destination. It's about getting away from our crazy world and enjoying simple pleasures.
One of the couples tenting nearby, from Fairfax, are out for a couple of  nights, but it's the first trip for the wife. They have twin toddlers at home. The rain doesn't seem to have dampened their spirits but the little ones seem to be on her mind. She also made a point of telling me they and the kids had been confirmed asymptomatic Covid cases some months ago.
We built a fire out of wet sticks. Without my magically flammable Fritos it took forever and never really sustained itself. Still, it partially dried some gear and was a good social activity. I haven't had a fire circle since the Smokies, and then it was only Sunshine and I.","Hightop Hut

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629484,"Felt a little introspective today. I've now come farther since Damascus than I hiked to get to Damascus. Virginia is a lo-ong state. Maybe I'm getting the Virginia Blues, that loss of the excitement and purpose of the early days. While I don't feel depressed, there are mornings I lack motivation, and I definitely feel I've gotten into a bit of a rut. Things aren't new anymore. When I see a beautiful flower or amazing view or interesting wildlife I think ""You already have a dozen pictures of that"". I knew this would come. It's one of the differences between a thruhike and a long section. Nothing retains its initial glow forever. Part of the challenge is finding the drive, and maybe the deeper purpose, to keep going. I am fortunate to have some time off with my family to look forward to. That may be the catalyst to reenergize me. For now, I don't know whether to slow down a bit and smell more roses, or set myself new and higher hurdles. Either way, I need to step out of my rut.
It was a cool morning thanks to an overcast sky. It sprinkled lightly as I hiked four miles to Skyland over rocky sidehill trail. The dining room didn't open until noon but the grab-and-go stand had microwavable breakfast sandwiches and cold teas, all I needed. There were people about but it seemed pretty subdued. That's the vibe I've gotten from Shenandoah each time I've been here. Seems like it should be more popular, busier, more crowded like other national parks. But outside of Old Rag - which is well off the AT - there are no marquee attractions. It's more like a large state park, attractive to fair weather weekend dayhikers and backpackers. Still, I saw no backpackers on the trail today, even though this is the most popular stretch of the park.
Around noon the sun came out and baked a few liters of water out of me. I stretched to double dip the waysides again, this time Skyland and the Elkwallow Wayside. But Elkwallow is 18.5 miles from Skyland, and closes at 5. So I booked and covered it in less than six hours. I'm finding that moderate climbs, 400 to 800 feet, barely bother me any more and don't slow me down. I'd almost rather climb than descend these rocky trails. Almost.
A mile south of Elkwallow I finally passed a backpacker. A Chris Pratt look-a-like out for the night.
At the wayside the grill was actually open! Cheeseburger, fries, and blackberry ice cream helped to fill my hollow leg. A young guy from Frederick, Maryland named Tre stopped in, on the first of a multi-day backpacking trip. He seemed interested in hiking to as many waterfalls as he could. That's one thing the AT bypasses. It sticks to the ridgeline, skipping all the side trails to falls a mile or three away. Maybe a reroute could take in a couple of these and add some variety to the traverse.
Leaving the wayside I soon came across Chris Pratt again, now going south. Or did I take a wrong turn and I'm heading south? So confused! But he'd simply gone north and turned around, thinking he was too far from his car. Never did get the full story. Seemed like he was training, as he mentioned carrying a thirty pound pack as if it were unnecessary.
The sun disappeared and clouds sprinkled on me again as I crossed Hogback and Little Hogback mountains to reach Gravel Springs Hut. I could see sheets of gray on the western side of the valley, probably heavier rain on the way.
At the shelter were a father and grown daughter, on leave from her Army base, out for a week. Also Turtle, a young North Carolinan southbounding 700 miles from Harpers Ferry to Max Patch, and a Santa Claus-looking Hoosier named Chet (as in Chet the reindeer in training) southbounding from Harpers to Springer. Two men later arrived, one of whom maintains a stretch of the AT in Shenandoah around Turks Gap and spent a lot of time putting in ""water bars"" to divert runoff. 
The rain did come, but not nearly as heavy as yesterday. 28 miles today took it out of me. The feet are sore, and the humidity has sapped my strength and enthusiasm. Looking forward to stopping near Front Royal tomorrow.","Rock Spring Hut

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629485,"A duet of snores from Tortoise and Chet serenaded me in the middle of the night. Haven't had to pull out the earplugs since Georgia. A heavy rain soon pounded on the roof, helping to drown it out. 
It's Friday, and the backpackers are finally out. Ran into a section hiker coming south from Jenkins Gap. Then 5 youth and 5 men with boy scout troop 1430 from South Riding, Virginia coming down Marshall Mountain. And two more groups of backpackers on Compton Peak and north of Compton Gap.
But the surprise was meeting a thruhiker, going south! A girl named Scoob had thrued northbound, summited Katahdin July 6, and was back to finish Shenandoah which she skipped when it was closed. She started March 1 in Georgia and was already 500 miles in when the ATC asked hikers to get off. She kept going. A case of being safer on the trail than traveling home. 
Several of the backpackers mentioned a thruhiker being a couple hours ahead of me. Someone who started six days before me. Didn't catch him today. Maybe soon.
I reached route 522 after fourteen miles and called it a day at Mountain Home B&B, which runs a hostel. It was barely after noon, but it's been five days since I left Waynesboro and I badly need a shower, laundry, and air conditioning. I'm no Daniel Boone! Lisa and Scott, a former thruhiker, have a lovely, huge historic Greek Revival home just off trail and were very welcoming. They keep the place sparkling clean.
Two pairs of southbounders were lingering on the patio, waiting on Thai takeout and hoping to miss a coming thunderstorm. They are all LASHing from Harpers Ferry to Springer, just like Chet from last night. Seems they have a tiny bubble.
In fact they seem to think there's a northbound bubble not far ahead. Fifteen thruhikers at Whiskey Hollow shelter two nights ago. 35 they've passed since leaving Harpers Ferry. We'll see. Other than Scoob today, I haven't seen a thruhiker since Sunshine and Lone Wolf pushed ahead after Daleville. Maybe that's a part of my lack of motivation. The social element is limited. I knew starting late and with this weird year I'd be hiking alone a lot, but it's different to experience it. Even a loner like me gains strength from shared experiences. If not for seeing the progress on Instagram of hikers I've met it would be even more isolating. 
Front Royal was a busy town. Found some Injinji liner socks at the outfitter, lighter and hopefully less sweaty than the padded Injinjis I picked up in Gatlinburg after melting my original liners by the fire. Still couldn't find any hiking/running shorts. Everything is basketball-style shorts with no liner. Closest I came was a pair with a liner at the thrift store in my size but in lavender. Maybe it shouldn't matter - function over form, right? - but I just couldn't do it.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629594,"Lisa and Scott at Mountain Home whipped me up a breakfast of eggs, fruit, OJ, coffee, toast, and homemade pear jam and black raspberry jam. There were several couples staying as well, one of which left before dawn to take a hot-air balloon ride over the Virginia countryside. 
I was in no hurry and didn't leave until nearly 11. The sun was high and it was already hot. The trail climbed mildly past the fenced-in Smithsonian Biological Preserve. Some rocks today but mostly nice trail. A couple of hot field crossings. The green tunnel makes such a difference. Ripe raspberries along the trail were an occasional distraction. 
Around ten miles in I reached a sunny back road that led nearly a mile to a country store. It was so hot all I could think about was a cold drink from their fridge. But when I saw the long hot exposed asphalt walk I just kept going north. I would be more comfortable staying in the green tunnel than walking two miles in the sun for cold drinks. By the time I made it back any benefit would be lost, and any drinks I carried out would no longer be cold. Better to find a cold stream.
That was a microcosm of the bigger internal debate I grappled with all day. Should I pick up the pace and try to catch up with the bubble that is supposedly ahead of me, or just keep hiking my own hike and smell the roses? There are times I'd like to see some familiar faces, but at what cost? Ultimately today's humidity made the decision for me. Ten miles is draining, let alone thirty.
At Manassas Gap shelter I caught up with a thruhiker named Smoky Bear, a grizzled construction foreman. He's had a few run-ins with bears recently, including a momma on Pass Mountain in Shenandoah who bluff charged him three times. Her cubs were up a tree alongside the trail. I think this is the guy some hikers had mentioned to me yesterday morning, though he too is behind the bubble.
Had lunch at Manassas with a middle-aged North Carolina couple out dayhiking. The wife grew up in California and says she can't explain why but she's fascinated by the AT and visits it whenever she can. Loves Max Patch.
The trail crossed a wildlife management area, then Sky Meadows state park, before crossing US 50 and winding up to Rod Hollow shelter. Most of this stretch is hemmed in by thick vegetation and has rocky footing. Not the kind of trail anyone seeks out. I often wonder why some forest has an open and inviting understory while other stretches are so overgrown. It doesn't seem to be anything obvious like the elevation, proximity to water, mix of trees, or amount of sun coming through the canopy. Some of this overgrowth may simply be out-of-control invasive species. A good fire may be needed to rejuvenate some of these areas.
Rod Hollow shelter was empty. No surprise - I was breaking webs to get here. It is Saturday, though, but no weekenders. Not that I'm complaining. There's a cold piped spring with delicious water and the forest sounds quickly lulled me to sleep.","US 522 (Front Royal)

The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club's infamous Roller Coaster started a mile out from the shelter. 13 hills in 13 miles, each up to a 500 foot climb. And naturally only two or three have views. With the heat and humidity, I felt every climb and they thoroughly drained me.
After six or seven of these I stumbled into the Sam Moore Shelter. So humid! I sat down on the edge of the sleeping platform to recover, and watched sweat drip off my nose and form a puddle in front of the shelter. 
After ten miles of roller coasting I popped into the Bears Den hostel just off trail. A beautiful stone mansion repurposed as a trail center, there's a bunkroom in the basement with an outside entrance. I used the secret hiker combination to open the door lock. It's the number of miles (to the tenth) from here to Manassas Gap. I think the hostel is closed for overnights, though the caretaker wouldn't be available until 5 to ask. However the bunkroom was accessible. I bought a couple of cold sodas from the honor system fridge, and cleaned up a bit in the bathroom. I could have showered if I wanted, but I didn't see the point since I was going right out again. 
As I was leaving I ran into Smoky Bear again, looking for the caretaker about hammocking in the yard. It would be several hours before the caretaker appeared. I told Smoky how to get in if he needed anything in the meantime. The code is designed so only long-distance hikers would know it, or know how to look it up. This is for security since lots of tourists drive up to a parking lot nearby to take in the view from Bear Den Rocks nearby.  
I was okay leaving Bears Den because a short distance later down in Snickers Gap I was able to walk to the Horseshoe Curve Restaurant. Jimmy cooked me up some mozzarella sticks and a chicken sandwich. The winding mountain road it sits on used to be the main route 7 highway, but was relegated to a back road when the highway was straightened many years ago. Horseshoe Curve started hosting live bands again a few weeks ago. 
There were no backpackers out today other than Smoky, but I passed many, many dayhikers, it being Sunday. They were mostly north of Morgan Mill Rd, which has a parking lot, and around Bears Den rocks and Raven Rocks on either side of Snickers Gap.  These not coincidentally are the three views of the roller coaster.
The roller coaster ended soon after Raven Rocks, at which point my guide said I went through a boulder field called the Devil's Racecourse. I don't specifically remember it, but this may have been where I started grumbling to myself how everyone complains about Pennsylvania's rocks. Virginia has had plenty of rocks on a regular basis since before Pearisburg. And my sneakers have the scars to prove it.
As evening approached I turned off the ridge to follow a side trail down to the Blackburn AT Center. This is another old summer house now run as a hiker amenity by the PATC like Bears Den, but this is not a hostel. Only the caretaker uses the house. There's a wood-stove heated shed with a few bunks for winter hikers, but most simply tent nearby. A group of five older women were setting up tents as I arrived. They are nearing the end of a forty mile section, and laughing like school girls. The Blackburn caretaker came out to offer everyone sodas.
Took an outdoor shower warmed by a solar-heated tank. I feel so clean in my tent now. The temperature last night was so warm I didn't need my sleeping bag. Tonight feels like it may be the same.","Rod Hollow Shelter
",Blackburn AT Center,"Jul 26, Sun",17.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629603,"It was a steep climb back to the ridge from Blackburn, and then six rocky but relatively level miles to Keys Gap. There I walked down the road to a convenience store and ate under a tree by a pond full of blooming lily pads. 
There's a stretch from New Jersey to Massachusetts called the ""deli run"" because it's studded with dining options within walking distance of the trail. I would argue the deli run actually begins in Shenandoah with the waysides, and runs through northern Virginia, southern Pennsylvania and eastern Pennsylvania. Maryland is a dry spell, though even it offers options to the motivated hiker. In any case, I expect to eat well for the next six hundred miles.
My plan today was to walk another six miles into Harpers Ferry, catch the bus to the Charles Town Walmart, and finally get some new shorts. As well as resupply to get me into Pennsylvania.
Over the course of the day I scared up a number of skittish young deer. They dash off at full speed like they haven't fine-tuned their flight instinct. A couple of weeks ago they were still spotted fawns clinging to mama. Now they are independent. I'm watching them grow up.
A few miles past Keys Gap I finally left Virginia - four weeks after entering it - and entered West Virginia. Four states done! This is the exact spot where I began my section hikes several years ago. I remember the excitement and anticipation as I tented on the border, preparing to head into Maryland the next day. Actually, I was attempting the Four State Challenge that first day, and came up a few miles short thanks to rain, a delay in town, and of course the colossal stupidity of attempting 44 miles on my first day. The trail has taught me a lot about myself. And while I still have those impulses, I understand them much better and sometimes even make wise decisions.
People in lifejackets were wading across the Shenandoah River as I crossed the bridge into town. They would walk along the bedrock islands where they could and swim through the gaps. It's a massive river. Especially compared to all the creeks and streams I regularly step across. I have a much greater appreciation for bridges now. And the challenges that explorers and armies faced without them.
I took the side trail to the ATC but it was closed. So I got my own picture in front of their iconic wall in barbaric Yawping stance. This is the psychological halfway point. If it doesn't call for a Yawp I don't know what does. I'm out of endless Virginia and into the mid-Atlantic states. Soon I will stop counting up the miles and start counting DOWN.
I reached the historic quarter well before 2, but somehow I missed the bus to Walmart. The area is so small and streets so narrow there's no way a bus could come through without everyone noticing. I called the dispatcher when it was well past two and she assured me the bus had gone through. If so, it must have been fifteen minutes early. The next wasn't due for two hours, which would make it necessary to overnight in the area. So my plan to resupply and find shorts at Walmart was dashed. That'll teach me to rely on public transportation.
Well, best-laid plans of mice and men will soon go awry, as they say. So I improvised. New plan: grab a light resupply at the small outfitter in the historic quarter. There is nothing else in walking distance. Hike to Fayetteville - 60 miles away - in two days, stay at the hostel and resupply there.
So I bought a jar of peanut butter and odds and ends from the extremely limited selection at the outfitter, and marched over the Potomac bridge. On the river below people were tubing and rafting. One guy rested in a tube on a shady bank, with a raft next to him holding a cooler. That's the way to travel! As I followed the river on the C&O canal many groups were beached on bedrock outcroppings in the middle of the river and soaking up the sun.
I was so motivated hiking into a new state I pushed another fifteen miles even though it was nearly four when I left Harpers. Climbed Weverton Cliffs for another great view of the river. Saw a sleeping bag abandoned by the trail. This is I believe the fifth one I've seen in my hikes. Still mystified how someone leaves that behind. Like all the others, it was far from any road, shelter, or campsite. 
So many rocks today. I got upset at the slow going up and down Lambs Knoll late in the evening. Had to break out the headlight to navigate the last fifteen minutes to the shelter.
At Rocky Run Shelter several water bottles and bags were on the picnic table but no one was in the shelter. Probably tenters up on the ridge. The shelter has two sleeping platforms, a deck, and a huge porch roof. Made myself at home in the darkness. It's very warm tonight. If not for the occasional bugs I would have left the liner off as well as the sleeping bag.","Blackburn AT Center
",Rocky Run Shelter,"Jul 27, Mon",27.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629643,"The water bottles disappeared from the shelter table around five in the morning, and soon after a party of backpackers trooped out in the early gloaming (what, I like the word!). They must have headed south as I was breaking webs most of the morning. I got myself out of camp after a very warm night sometime after eight.
The AT follows South Mountain through Maryland, part of the Blue Ridge. It was the site of skirmishes and much maneuvering before and after Lee's invasion of Maryland in September 1862 that climaxed at Sharpsburg (known to yankees as Antietam after the creek). Along the trail one finds old fieldstone walls that served as cover, old roadbeds over gaps that were sought out by scouts to sneak around enemy forces, and some memorials to the dead. Sadly one such memorial, a granite stone memorializing some of the Confederate officers, has been vandalized by what looks like a pickaxe. As a history buff any effort to damage or eradicate history troubles me, even more so when done to purposefully forget or obscure the past. As wise men have noted countless times, forgetting the past is the surest way to repeat it. 
The Washington monument near Boonesboro is from a different era. Erected in 1827 by ""the citizens of Boonesboro"" as the first monument to the father of our country, it's a tower of fieldstone overlooking the western valley which was restored in the 1930s and just completed additional restoration this year. The scaffolding is now down and it looks like new, the US and Maryland flags flanking it. Unfortunately it is closed, like the state park around it. Though thoughtfully there is a water pump and bathrooms for hikers, as there were further south in Gathland state park.
Saw several black snakes on trail today, including a five-footer. He didn't want to move, but after I tried to lift him with my pole he slithered off.
Maryland has several fine viewpoints over the western valley - Annapolis Rocks, Black Rocks, Pen Mar Park, and others. But one, High Rocks, is directly accessible by a road and rarely supervised. As a result, every inch of the rocks are covered in colorful graphitti. And the vandals, who no doubt fancy themselves artists, have been encouraged by this neglect to tag many trees and rocks within easy walking distance. How this travesty became a local tradition I don't know, but it's unique along the trail. Perhaps a clean up job and some video cameras are in order to restore this viewpoint. Or maybe closing the road and seeing how far vandals are willing to walk.
I called a guy named Roger to shuttle into Waynesboro from Pen Mar Road. But first I crossed the Mason Dixon line into my home state of Pennsylvania. And celebrated with a handful of wild raspberries. That's six states done. Though the last two, West Virginia and Maryland, took less than two days.
Although I didn't attempt the Four State Challenge of walking from Virginia to Pennsylvania in 24 hours, I accidentally came close. It took about 29 hours, from 1pm yesterday to 6pm today. Subtract out the two hours I spent in Harpers Ferry waiting for a bus and the eleven hours I spent at the shelter and it's a respectable 16 hours of walking over some 44 miles. Maryland is not a difficult state, despite the rocks. Could I have done that without sleeping in the middle? Most likely, but honestly I just don't care. I'm pretty certain I would have been sore, hangry, and irritable at the end of it, and that wouldn't tell me anything I don't already know. 
Stopping in Waynesboro turned out to be a good decision. I found new shorts with a liner and pockets at Walmart (really a basic bathing suit), resupplied, showered and dried out everything at the Super 8, and did laundry at a nearby laundromat. I felt like a new man after several days and nights in the heat. The fact that Waynesburger, famous for huge burgers and milkshakes, was closed on Tuesdays was a disappointment, but I recovered with a trip to an Italian place, and stayed up far too late watching Office reruns.","Rocky Run Shelter
",Pen Mar Rd (Waynesboro),"Jul 28, Tue",25.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629645,"Lazy morning in Waynesboro. I drained a half gallon of OJ again. This is becoming a habit. Hit Waynesburger for a milkshake before leaving town but wasn't hungry enough for a burger, let alone their eight patty Cardiac burger. 
Roger took me back to the trail after noon. He also shuttles locals around who have no vehicle. There's no taxi, bus, or Uber here. He even took a woman 30 minutes to Chambersburg each day for work until the woman lost the job for failing to show up. Some people are way behind on paying or never pay at all. Not hikers though. Roger never had a problem with a hiker, he says. Thank God. It only takes a few bad apples to spoil things for everyone else, and we need people like Roger.
The hiking was easy today, but I still managed to get lost. Crossing Old Route 16 I walked straight across into the opening in the trees which followed an old roadbed. Half a mile later I noticed I hadn't seen a white blaze in a while. Sure enough the GPS had me well off the trail. Had to double back and walk a few yards down the road to the actual trail. I should know better to check the blazes at crossings.
The AT crossed many woods roads in Michaux state forest, still part of the Blue Ridge mountains even this far north. I wondered when they'd been cleared, and who had used them. Most were overgrown. Likely old wagon roads. The state forest is named for Andre Michaux who, like John Bartram of southern Appalachian fame, was a botanist who explored the Appalachians finding new plants and selling them to collectors in Europe. At one time prosaic landscaping plants like the rhododendron were much coveted exotic flora.
I passed the site of the demolished Antietam shelter. The privy still stands with ""Closed"" spray-painted across it. Just ahead, the trail skims the Old Forge Picnic Area. A guy sitting in a camp chair yelled over that the spigot was working if I needed water. Then he ambled over and asked about my hike. Then he offered me a cold beer. Trail magic! Augie, my trail angel, is a PATC trail maintainer. He was just relaxing, not expecting any hikers. But he's seen a bubble go through a few days ago and was interested if anyone was behind me. 
I lost the trail again soon after. Went straight ahead at Tumbling Run Shelter, where a family was setting up their tent. It was many minutes later before I noticed the blazes on this trail were blue. I'd long passed the shelter and water source, so no idea where that trail led. Once again I doubled back and found the white blazes turned off just before the shelter. Fool me once, shame on you, but fool me twice? In the same day? I gotta pay more attention.
It was getting late and my goal now was to reach Route 30 where there is a burger joint and hostel within walking distance - before the burger joint closes. But as I hiked briskly along I noticed a girl lying spreadeagled on a large rock by the trail. She looked like she was resting, but not moving. So I slowed down and asked if everything was alright. She was called Peaches, and had hiked from Vermont. As she said, she'd been out so long she was past caring about where she laid down anymore. She's near the end, she has to stop at Harpers Ferry. Time to get back to college for fall semester.
Despite mostly easy trail the last miles over Rocky Mountain lived up to its name. The trail builders ran the AT up through the bouldery ridgeline a few times to make things interesting. Just thirty yards off the ridge it's smooth dirt trail.
I hit Route 30 around 7:30. Bonfire Burger was still open, and I had an amazing burger and milkshake. The highway is noisy and busy but has a wide shoulder. Wide enough for the mile walk to the hostel.
Tina at the New Life Worship Center, a Pentecostal church which runs the hostel, showed me around the bunkhouse, which has a kitchen and living room. Then she led me over to the church to load me up with leftovers from their Wednesday night potluck. Pastor Bob insisted I take more food. Good people! I would count this as trail magic as well. After a thousand miles it's been a pretty magical day.","Pen Mar Rd (Waynesboro)
",US 30 (Fayetteville),"Jul 29, Wed",17.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629662,"It's been noticeably cooler the past few days. Humidity is lower too, judging from my water intake and the fact my clothes are slightly less damp in the morning. Granted, it's still approaching 90 degrees each day, but a few degrees makes a big difference, and sometimes there's even a cool breeze through the forest.
Today may be the easiest twenty mile section of trail since Georgia. There were some rocky sections (through which I did not come unscathed, see below), but most of it was dirt or pine needle trail with little elevation change. It passed over many state forest gravel roads, through open scrub oak and pine forests, and by several lovely shelters and cabins, including Quarry Gap Shelter which, with its porch swing, dual shelters, covered breezeway and picnic areas, board games, and flower garden all surrounded by a rhododendron forest and a seasonally-gurgling brook may be the best-maintained shelter on the AT. 
I got trail magic for the second day in a row, at Shippensburg Road! Two middle-aged guys were sitting by the parking lot with a cooler and extra camp chairs. Like usual I didn't want to assume, and after all it's an unlikely time of year to be purposefully setting up trail magic here, and so I paused for a minute looking around for the trail. They offered me a cold soda. Well, thank you, don't mind if I do! Of course they weren't there specifically to do trail magic and were as surprised to see me as I them. They were in fact waiting for a woman named Mercury who is attempting to break the women's thruhiking speed record, having left Springer 23 days ago. One of the guys, a local trail maintainer, thrued in 2004. His buddy hiked to Franklin with him. They were impressed with how quickly I was moving, but then it's taken me well over twice as long to get here as Mercury.
A few minutes later Mercury's support van drove up, and out popped trail legend Warren Doyle. Warren not only set the first ""fastest known time"" or FKT on the Appalachian Trail back in 1973, but he's personally thruhiked 18 times, more than anyone else, ever. He also founded ALDHA, the American Long Distance Hikers Association, which runs numerous hiker events, runs a school for backpackers and aspiring thruhikers, has led numerous group thruhikes, and I believe is a college lecturer or professor on Appalachian studies.
Warren is the yin to the ATC's yang. His philosophy is the trail should be open to all and is there to be enjoyed by hikers. He is fiercely protective of, in a way embodies, the spirit of the trail community. While respecting the wilderness experience, he doesn't see it as the end all be all. He once planted a clawfoot bathtub in a swimming hole along the trail which was a hit with hikers. Even though it was next to a trash-strewn road and within earshot of the interstate the ATC removed it because it violated the wilderness experience. He is also very attentive to any reports of problems hikers experience along the trail. The ATC hid data on trail incidents for years until a Harrisburg reporter forced them to reveal it. I should note, however, that the AT's 2000 mile corridor is safer than any comparably populated town.
I had to get moving if I was going to get to Pine Grove Furnace and do the Half Gallon Challenge before they close, even though Mercury hadn't arrived yet. I saw Warren again at a gravel road four miles later. Mercury was still behind me. I was putting on the speed to make it to the store. For some reason I felt giddy as I went on a slight downhill and began to jog. Maybe the thrill of competition, or a delayed sugar rush from the trail magic sodas. So I bounded over and around rocks and hopped and jumped and jogged until, inevitably, I caught my toe on a rock and flew headlong toward the ground. The instant I misstepped I knew I was going to crash. I watched it happen in slow motion, watched the rocks ahead of me, hoped I could land well and not break the fall with my knee. And so I sprawled into the dirt and rocks. And lay for a moment, half-stunned but quietly awaiting damage reports from all stations. The hands and knees cried pain, but superficial. The right leg reported soreness in the thigh and below the knee. After a minute I stood up and put weight where weight needed to go. Soreness, yes, but nothing broken. Some bloody scrapes, but nothing I hadn't gotten on trail runs before. I gathered my sticks and tenderly began walking, favoring the left leg as the muscles in my right warmed up and eased the soreness. There would be some bruises, but nothing serious, I thought. I would not, however, be running over rocks again anytime soon.
I reached Pine Grove Furnace State Park and their general store at ten of seven, just in time to buy a half gallon of ice cream. The girl, already closing up, entrusted me with the much-prized wooden Dixie cup spoon that passes for a trophy, though I had yet to earn it. A local, Charlie, was hanging out for the wifi and he timed me as I dug in. I ate deliberately but consistently. I was in no rush and had no desire to become sick. Eating became easier as the ice cream melted. 
33 minutes later I was done. A 40% improvement over my time from three years ago, though then I'd only hiked from the Virginia border, a mere 80 miles. 1105 miles changes ones appetite. 
Charlie, my independent ice cream record verifier, told me how he worked for AT&T for many years, shifting from one soon-to-be obsolete job to another as the phone giant's business model collapsed. He now works at Entenmann's making donuts, a job that most kids would love their dad to have. But apparently there is a paucity of teamwork and perhaps a bit of backstabbing in the bureaucratic donut business and Charlie doesn't think much of the job.
Still no sign of Mercury. She may have stopped for the day. Considering she'd already done over forty miles I can't blame her. (Note: I later saw she ended her day here twenty minutes after I left for the hostel, so I missed her again)
Given the late hour, ice cream became dinner - another thing kids would love to hear from their parents. Not really full but knowing it was a bad idea to throw anything more down the black hole tonight, I walked to the Ironmasters Mansion next door and registered for the hostel. A wedding party was still celebrating. In fact the groom was the son of the innkeeper. They offered me leftovers and soda - more trail magic!
The hostel is in an impressive nineteenth century mansion with wonderful molding and brickwork. But the shower was terrible - cramped, nozzle far too high and unable to angle properly, and clogged up. But it washed the blood, sweat, and dirt off, which is all I really needed. 
A southbounder is here. He started a few days ago near Duncannon and is headed to Springer.  We are the only guests in the bunkroom. The newlyweds have the master suite.","US 30 (Fayetteville)
",Pine Grove Furnace General Store,"Jul 30, Thu",19.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629663,"Still a lot of pain in my thigh and especially below the knee this morning, particularly going up and down stairs. I'm fairly sure it's just acute soreness from bruising the muscles in yesterday's headlong flight into the rocks, though it's certainly unpleasant. We'll see how hiking goes today. 
To make things more interesting I'm out of cash. There was an ATM at the general store, but my bank card just expired and I won't get the replacement until I see my family in a week. Everyone wanted cash the last two days. I literally have one penny in my pack. Looking ahead I should have non-cash options where needed, but it's disconcerting not having a backup. 
So I left Ironmasters around 10 and limped the first nine miles to the Green Mountain Deli. The trail here was thankfully very level with only one mild climb and few rocks. I have been lucky to have no serious injury in all my time on the AT. A few ankle rolls, some blisters, and a mild shin splint is as bad as it's gotten. Feeling regular pain anywhere near the knee is a new experience. It helps me better appreciate what many hikers I've met - old and young - have gone through.
After a Reuben sandwich and half a gallon of iced tea at the deli, the next eight miles were hillier. But my leg felt stronger. Uphills were easier than downhills. On the last climb I passed Center Knob, the original halfway point of the AT, and left the Blue Ridge for good. I've spent about 900 of the first 1100 miles in this massive range. It reinforces the transition to the northern half of the trail.
At the bottom of Center Knob the trail empties into level cornfields in the Cumberland Valley. There I called home to make arrangements to hike with my sons next week as I near Philadelphia. By the time we were done I'd reached Boiling Springs and was walking past bobbing ducks in the fishing pond that dominates the village. The regional ATC office here is closed, but I fueled up at the convenience store. 
I find it hard to ""camel up"" on water - that is, chug a liter when I come across a good spring in a dry area - but I had no trouble downing 80oz of iced tea in fifteen minutes. 
In the evening I hiked out of Boiling Springs eight miles across the valley through a narrow green tunnel, corn and soybean fields mere yards away through the trees. The background roar of trains and turnpike traffic gradually made room for the cacophony of crickets.
The last couple of miles I walked in the dark, and surprisingly encountered a large group out walking as I reached the pedestrian bridge over route 11. A dirt scramble down to the road and half a mile of asphalt shoulder brought me to a motel. The lot was packed - the Ford Discovery car show is in town. But rooms they had, and within minutes I was at the Middlesex Diner next door getting takeout ravioli before they closed.
With three stores or restaurants in less than twenty miles this is definitely part of the deli run. And here I am carrying a pound of peanut butter around like a schmuck.
The leg is still sore, and contributes a new dimension to my typical end-of-day hiker hobble. But after 27 miles I think it passed the test. I'm more confident it's just a bad bruise and nothing orthopedic. Hopefully not famous last words.","Pine Grove Furnace General Store

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629674,"Walked out of the Cumberland Valley this morning through pastures and over fence stiles. Passed a trailhead on Sherwood Drive with 24 cars. Wuh oh. It's Saturday. Dayhiker alert! Sure enough, I passed a few dozen people in the next two miles as the trail wound its way up Blue Mountain.
Like yesterday, my leg bothered me more starting out, causing me to limp, but felt stronger after a few hours. Uphills again were little problem but downhills were uncomfortable. By late in the day I was walking over rocky trail with no discomfort, other than the still-healing skinned knee.
AWOL states uncharacteristically that the several miles leading to Duncannon are ""very rocky"". I don't believe it labels any other section of trail that way. There were plenty of rocks, but I wouldn't say it was worse than Rocky Mountain a couple days back, let alone parts of Maryland or Virginia. 
The trail runs directly through Duncannon. At the first convenience store I met a pair of young thruhikers, Trotsky and Hot Pants, first thruhikers I've seen in 150 miles. Trotsky's dad lives in Boiling Springs and they've been staying there for four nights while hiking the area (but not slackpacking, they hastened to add). They've fallen behind a bubble of hikers they think are 60 miles ahead.
I walked out of town to Mutzabaugh's market to resupply. I had maybe a day's worth of food, but haven't had to dig into it much over the deli run of the last few days. From here to Port Clinton the trail stays far from towns. 
Undecided about whether to stay in town or hike up Peters Mountain to the next shelter, I stopped by the outfitter, Kind of Outdoorsy, which runs a hostel. I figured if it was open I'd stay, if not I'd hike on. The store was closed. Next door some men were tearing out the floor of an empty storefront. One of them came out and asked if I was looking for the hostel. Decision made, I nodded. 
The guy was not the owner, but a New York refugee helping with construction in return for board in a nearby building. The owner, a retail executive from DC, had grown up here and has purchased most of the block. He's turning it into a hiker center, outfitter and cafe, as his own contractor, commuting from DC on weekends. Which would be great for thruhikers, given the deterioration of the Doyle and the paucity of good hostels in Pennsylvania.
Mike, another construction helper who is taking a break from thruhiking for a couple of weeks of free boarding, told me they were going for a swim in the Susquehanna. I wasn't aware that was possible, or even advisable, given the industrial legacy of the river valley. So I headed over and found the access through a tunnel under the rail trestle. There a small stony beach with a fire ring offered easy entry to the river. I waded in for a dip. The water was surprisingly warm. Not quite like jumping in an alpine lake, but when in the middle of Pennsylvania on an August day you take what you can get.
Started raining in the evening. Guess my non-decision decision to stay in town paid off.","US 11 (Carlisle)

And chugging a half gallon of OJ. Which seems to work for me. 
I left the hostel at Kind of Outdoorsy around 10 and walked a couple of miles through Duncannon's residential area and over the Clark's Ferry Bridge to the north side of the Susquehanna. It was ungodly humid as I climbed a thousand feet or so to the ridge. I was sweating bullets in minutes and my clothes were drenched not long after. A light rain came and went with little effect.
A young guy was hiking down from the shelter with a soft guitar case slung over his shoulder. Yes, it really held a guitar. He said he had spent three days in the woods to get away from alcohol. And from civilization in general. When he'd been homeless at one point he had done a lot of hiking. I felt sorry for the guy. He didn't seem to look forward to much back in civilization. Even the air conditioning is too cold for him. Anyway, it made me appreciate all the loved ones I have outside of my hiking life.
The trail was, from my point anyway, a bit monotonous today. Mostly followed Peters Mountain ridge, then crossed over to similar ridges on Sharp and Stony Mountains. It was generally rocky or stony, though it did in places pass huge hillsides full of boulders, staying clear on nice dirt trail. So the trail builders have some mercy. 
I remember dayhiking a portion of this back in April. Back then I didn't know if or when I'd be thruhiking this year, and it had been pleasant just to be out in the woods for awhile. It was a lot less humid then too.
I rested at Peters Mountain Shelter. A clutch of butterflies were swarming the wildflowers nearby and I spent some time photographing them (more at the linked Instagram account). Often there'd be two or even three on the same plant.
Water is scarce in this stretch. There's a good piped spring north of route 325, and a creek just south of the road (hikers usually prefer springs to creeks for taste and safety). Both are 18 miles from town. Other than that the sources are dry, or a long way down the ridge from a shelter. As I tend to shun the latter, I walked the 18 miles before filling up. Chugging that half gallon of OJ was a good idea.
The sun was dipping low and I was worn out so I stopped at a tentsite a few miles north and miles short of the Rausch Gap shelter. No water here, of course, but I had cameled up at the piped spring so I'll be fine until morning. The ground is rooty and rocky so I'm thankful for my inflatable pad.","Duncannon

Over the miles I have lots of time to calculate. Since Gatlinburg I've averaged 22 miles per day, not including two zero days. And it hasn't changed - I averaged 22 a day from Gatlinburg to Damascus, from Damascus to Waynesboro, Virginia, and from Waynesboro to Duncannon. So I feel fairly confident projecting where I'll be up until the Whites. There I expect to slow down. I am still on pace to finish in the first week of October. Four months, give or take a few days. Taking a week off with my family will hopefully recharge my batteries for the last thousand miles.
I figured today would just be putting in miles, being on a nondescript ridgeline with no landmarks and virtually no other hikers. But two things made it memorable. 
Before either of these happened I was stung by a hornet. Where it came from I don't know. The first I was aware of it was when I felt the painful sting on my left knee. I instinctively smacked it and it was no more, but it had already done its damage. Perhaps I'd walked into its path. It seemed like a random attack. This new pain above the left knee oddly balanced out the residual soreness below my right knee, so I no longer favored one over the other. 
But the first of today's really memorable events came next. After crossing Rausch Gap the trail waded into an enormous swamp formed by a prodigious beaver dam. Signs warn you of the obstacle and provide an alternate route. Guthooks is full of gung-ho comments like ""don't you dare take the alternate!"" and ""are we hiking a bicycle path or the AT?"". But there are plenty of cautions like ""you will get wet up to your waist"" and ""I thought I would try it until I saw it"". Well, in the end I figured what am I doing out here if I'm going to take the easy route? How bad can it really be?
Bad.
Yes, it was every bit as awful as the comments said. It was intimidating just to walk up to it. The water stretches to left and right beyond your sight. And way over yonder you can see where it ends, a good hundred yards across. Trees with blazes stand in a line across it, submerged in the muck. The water is black and completely opaque. You've no idea what's under there or how deep it goes. In most places it's thigh or waist deep. There are downed trees everywhere to navigate around. And as some commenters mentioned, there are probably lots of creepy crawly things swimming around.
But there is a trick to minimizing the awfulness. Walk on top of the beaver dam. Even the dam is submerged, but only a few inches. Stay on top and only your ankles get wet. And everything below them of course. But walking on top of something you can't see, which is no more than a pile of sticks and mud, and which shifts and sighs under your weight, with deep muck on both sides waiting to suck you in, is not for the faint of heart. I took one step at a time, feeling forward with my trekking poles. Sometimes I made a wrong move and went knee deep into muck. Other times I wrestled downed trees to get over them without stepping off the dam. Early on I saw a bog bridge - one of those small 2x6 trestles laid across mud by kind trail builders - just a couple of inches below the water. So I stepped onto it, and immediately it began to sink without stopping. It had merely been floating and was not supported at all. It was probably the bridge over the original small stream before the beavers arrived. Now it's just more debris. I quickly found the dam and stepped back.
If you stuck close to the blazed trees you'd be swimming across the swamp. Going over the dam I managed to escape with just muddy shoes, socks, and calves. I'm glad I didn't switch to sandals. They would have been lost to the sucking mud in one of my missteps. 
The other highlight of my day, and on the opposite end of the spectrum, was a last minute visit from my sister Emily. She and her family live in the Hershey area, and it did not occur to me until this morning that the trail would go within about fifteen miles of them. But I had no service all morning so it was not until I summited Second Mountain that I could contact her. She dropped everything and came out with my five-year-old nephew Sammy, meeting me in Swatara Gap state park. And she brought sandwiches, cold drinks, and fruit! I was thrilled to see them both. In fact they are the first family I've seen since my son flew back home after the first week in Georgia. My nephew is a joy, always happy and energetic. He showed me his Jedi ninja moves, and I showed him how to use the trekking poles (not for Jedi ninja moves!) Only two miles later I was out of the park and back on the inaccessible ridgeline, so it was only Emily's quick reaction that allowed us to meet at all. What a wonderful sister I am blessed with!
Late in the day it started to rain. It was too light to don a poncho but enough to eventually make me feel wet. To balance it out, it brought a refreshing cool wind. I was headed for the 501 shelter, close to route 501 and famous for the ability to have pizza delivered. But I noticed the pizza place noted in the guide was closed on Mondays. Today is Monday! Aargh! Disappointed, I gave up my dreams of town food and just hoped the shelter would be open. It's a fully-enclosed building with a caretaker. Guthook comments suggested it might be closed. 
After what seemed an eternity of traipsing over rocks in the last mile I finally reached the shelter. A man with a long black and white beard was coming out. ""Are you the caretaker?"" ""Nope, just a hiker staying here."" ""Excellent, then I'm staying too!"" The guy, named Jaws after a passing resemblance (without the beard) to the seven-foot tall James Bond villain, is sectioning from Daleville to Connecticut. When Jaws saw the caretaker earlier, the caretaker said that since it was raining he didn't know anything about Jaws being there. Then he offered Jaws a foot bath with Epsom salts.   
Even better news, a menu for another pizza place was in the shelter. This one was open. So I got my town food, and a two-liter bottle of Coke. Wasn't a lot of water on trail today.
It started pouring during the night, remnants of the hurricane. So glad I'm in hard shelter and not tenting tonight.","Tentsite at mile 1172.5
",501 Shelter,"Aug 03, Mon",23.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629922,"I wouldn't say today was my worst day on trail, but it certainly ranks among the most memorable.
Two of my boys are meeting me in Hamburg early tomorrow morning to hike with me for a couple of days. Which means I had to get to Port Clinton today. The tropical storm that pounded the shelter overnight hadn't let up by morning. If anything it intensified by mid-morning. First I had to find the privy, which was absurdly far from the shelter, almost a ten minute walk through mud and marshy grass. Even then I almost missed it, as I'd taken the wrong trail of many in the area, and had to bushwhack to get to it.
Around 10 I hiked out with the poncho on fully expecting to get completely soaked and be able to say only that I had endured the day. For the first couple hours I listened to an audio book, then that ran out and I had nothing to distract me. I couldn't use my phone for anything but a quick picture, not even to check the map. When I'd pull it out raindrops would quickly confuse the touchscreen and it was impossible to make it respond correctly. Not to mention my fingers were wet to the point of pruning, and I feared damaging it. So I couldn't even respond to texts asking after my safety.
The trail itself was a stream, a creek in many places. The depth varied from an inch or two up to six or ten inches. Inclines became cascading waterfalls. Level stretches became elongated shallow ponds. Dry springs became raging streams. Streams became flooded plains. And nearly all the while there were rocks in and under the water.
The stretches without rocks were harder. Just slick mud with no solid foothold. After noon the rain began to ebb, and eventually ceased around 1. But gusts of wind continued to knock drops off the trees and effectively continued a sporadic shower for another hour or two. As the afternoon wore on the trail began to drain but many flooded areas persisted.
After the rain had stopped but before the sun came out I almost stepped on a white rattlesnake resting in the middle of the trail. He slithered away without rattling. I guess he was waiting for the sun to show.
Twice I heard and saw huge branches drop from nearby trees and crash on the forest floor.
The rocks were relentless today. Not the piles of rocks I associate with my home state, where you step from rock to rock. They were there but only occasionally. It was dirt trail with embedded rocks poking their spines out. Hard to rock hop these. My legs were sore from sidestepping so many.
I caught up with Jaws late in the afternoon and together we made it to Port Clinton by 7. I'd called ahead and found there was no room at Microtel, the lone motel in the greater Hamburg area. Nor at the lone B&B. The tiny Port Clinton Hotel, which lets rooms to hikers sometimes, wasn't answering and appeared to be closed. So there would be no drying out tonight.
I trekked a couple of miles toward the Walmart/Cabela's area along a bike trail, looking for possible stealth sites along the way. I left the trail and found myself in a fallow farm field, and navigated around the farm house to a rural road that took me to the route 61 highway which in turn led to the commercial area. Many stores and restaurants with flashing open signs were actually closed. All the fast food joints were drive through only. I needed to sit down somewhere. Red Robin was the only place that fit the bill.
I gave myself the shivers downing iced tea and a milkshake to the point I was relieved to step out of the air conditioning into the warm humid evening. Darkness was already falling. No time to find a new site. I almost tented on a grass strip behind Lowe's, but decided to return to route 61 where I'd seen an abandoned primitive pavilion a few yards from the highway. It offered cover, and a smalldirt patch in a sea of weeds. A decaying picnic table offered partial cover from the road, and a line of trees shielded the view from the cornfields beyond. Still, I worried for awhile that every light or sound was a cop or a farmer coming to evict me from what was presumably private property. It felt like a pure hiker trash moment. But what else was I to do when every bed in town was booked? 
I drifted off fitfully between the sounds of truck brakes and rushing traffic nearby.","501 Shelter
",Port Clinton rail trail (Hamburg),"Aug 04, Tue",23.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629985,"Slept fitfully thanks to truck traffic throughout the night, but awoke refreshed regardless. The temperature dipped enough that I had to pull out my sleeping bag in the middle of the night.
I half expected a cop or some landowner to find me and kick me out during the night. If I was trespassing there were no signs and the pavilion had obviously been used by others, if not hikers, and was not maintained. So really just my conscience bothering me. I had tried to pay for a room. Another hiker later told me he had plopped himself in the Microtel's lobby until the unhelpful manager had ""found"" a room. Not sure what to make of the place suddenly filling up on a weeknight.
I walked to Dunkin Donuts for breakfast, then Walmart to resupply. My wife Sara drove my two younger sons Jonathan, 12, and Nathan, 10, up from the Philly suburbs to join me on trail for two days. The storm knocked out power at home for most of yesterday into the early morning so it was questionable whether this would happen. But the boys were excited about coming and had already packed before the storm. I was overwhelmed to see them. It had been two whole months since their older brother and I had left for Georgia.
Sara took us to Port Clinton, also giving Jaws a lift, who had found his way to Walmart after sleeping in the Port Clinton town pavilion last night, a place I'd avoided for its reputation as a hangout for locals. In Port Clinton I took the boys to the Peanut Shop for some trail sweets, where we were spoiled by uncountable choices both traditional and contemporary, then headed to the trail by the rail yard where the boys checked out the boulder-sized chunks of anthracite coal. 
The trail wound under busy route 61 where it looked like one or two homeless people had set up. Then it went straight up Blue Mountain, a fairly steep incline up 600 feet. I knew this would be very tough for the boys and we prepared by loading up on sugar. They tackled it with resolve and made me proud. 
We had lunch at a nice set of boulders with a view that Nathan picked out before climbing further to the ridge. After a couple more miles over fairly rocky trail we reached Pocahontas Spring. Yesterday's storm had turned it into a small creek and flooded the trail around it. Similar story at Minnehaha Spring, which had been dry two days ago. And a mile farther there was a raging gusher of runoff that wasn't listed in AWOL or Guthooks at all. 
The no-see-ums started to get to us as evening approached. Fortunately we soon reached the Windsor Furnace shelter, an open log structure with mortared gaps. A brown mouse kept peeking out from underneath, as if curious about his new tenants. The privy here has been torn down and a new one is in the early stages of construction, so bring a spade if you stay.
We built two fires in the large fire ring to test whether Fritos and Doritos were the better firestarter. The Fritos won out, though the Doritos seemed to have the early lead. For dinner we rehydrated potatoes and ramen, the boys' favorites.
A hiker from Virginia named Bear Bag walked in around 7. Said he had started in Daleville and hoped to reach Katahdin this year, though he'd already taken twenty zeroes. Said he was thruhiking. Named a bunch of hikers I'd never met, presumably far ahead of us. Also complained incessantly that the side trail hadn't an explicit sign for the shelter. Probably because it's so close to a parking lot, to minimize day use. He bummed some paper off me to go out a sign so his buddy would be sure to find the place. That hiker arrived at dusk looking generally unhappy and set up his tent before cooking in front of the shelter well after dark. 
After a hard day of hiking I expect the boys and I will sleep pretty well tonight.","Port Clinton rail trail (Hamburg)
",Windsor Furnace Shelter,"Aug 05, Wed",6.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630022,"In the morning I met Farmer, last night's late arrival. I hadn't recognized him at first, but he'd been working at Garden Mountain hostel in Virginia two years ago when, during a section hike, I stayed there and had my infamous midnight ribs dinner. I'd made a reservation a week ahead but they weren't home to pick me up as arranged, so I ended up walking two miles to their farm down a sketchy switchbacked gravel road and across numerous cow pastures. The hostel was a bunk room in a huge Victorian farmhouse. The bunks had wooden slats but no mattresses so I slept on the floor. The owner, a Brit ex-pat named Mark, spent the evening watching cable news at maximum volume and earnestly educating me on QAnon conspiracies. When, with my stomach grumbling, I finally abandoned tact around 8:30 and asked when the included dinner might occur, he headed off to the kitchen. Half an hour later he proudly announced the ribs, just out of the freezer, were in the oven and would be ready in just a few hours! Words failed me. I fell asleep on the floor of the bunk room and, sure enough, was awoken at midnight by Mark carrying in a plate piled with four pounds of the toughest ribs I've ever had. Nothing else, just ribs. I gnawed at them for twenty minutes until my jaws were exhausted, then went back to sleep. Mark was still in bed when Farmer drove me back the next morning. I heard from others at the time that my experience was a not unusual, though I seem to have set the record for latest dinner.
Farmer didn't seem to remember me specifically but took the opportunity to say he never thought much of Mark's hospitality instincts and thought he was always looking for a quick buck. Mark seems to have since turned over hostel management to someone who knows hikers. The place now gets rave reviews. At the time I didn't understand why exactly Farmer was there and what he was supposed to be doing, and our reacquaintance made it clear he didn't either.
The boys slept well and were ready to tackle the day after some oatmeal and peaches. Cool weather helped us up the climb to the Pulpit, with a boulder scramble near the end. We admired the view of rolling farmland and forested knobs broken by the sea of boulders called Blue Rocks. Nearby we explored the observatories on the lawn of the astronomy club, and had some fun photographing Nathan's Buddy Bison doll in odd locations.
The level walk over to the Pinnacle was inordinately rocky. At one point I dropped my phone on the rocks but it seemed to be fine. Only later did I find the rear camera lens had shattered, ruining any future pictures. This did not look repairable. Nor, given the low cost Moto G-series brand phone, would it be economical.  I'll be replacing the phone as soon as I have a chance.
We passed Bear Bag and Farmer, who were lunching next to a pile of rocks they assumed was the Pinnacle, to take the side trail to the actual Pinnacle. There we whiled away a long lunch on the open ledges enjoying perfect weather and long pastoral views. Nathan in particular enjoyed what he called the patchwork farm fields. Almost no one else around, which is unusual for this popular overlook.
The remainder of the day was level or downhill and far less rocky. We reached a meadow where one of the boys needed to heed nature's call. While we waited, two does we had frightened into the woods earlier returned, left, and came back several times, either curious of us or wondering when we'd be leaving them to browse in private. 
Nathan has been chewing a roll of Blue Raspberry gum for the last two days, and some other treats of the same flavor he picked up at The Peanut Shop. So we dubbed him Blue Raspberry. Jonathan has steadfastly refused to consider any trail names in his several trips with me, but it will arise naturally some day.
The trail continued to be easy walking and turned gently downhill but by mid-afternoon Blue Raspberry was near the end of his endurance. He laid on the ground at one point with his pack on, declaring he had used up all of his energy. More specifically, he'd finished his gum. Buddy Bison, dangling from the pack, fell in the mud. Thus earning it the trail name Muddy Bison. 
We passed a scout troop near the end coming up from the parking lot we were headed for. One scout took pains to say it was a couple hundred yards to the lot. The long side trail seemed several times that distance and sorely tested Blue Raspberry's patience, but finally we arrived and found Sara waiting to take us all home. I'll be taking a week off with the family but will return here to continue the journey north to Katahdin.
Coming home was at first dream-like, as if I'd found a very welcoming hostel. Little seemed to have changed in my absence, except I swear my two teenagers grew an inch or two. Before long it felt almost like I had never left.","Windsor Furnace Shelter

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630023,"After a weeklong vacation from hiking I intended to head out yesterday, but I needed a day off to recuperate from my vacation from hiking. So I took a vacation from my vacation from my vacation. 
It was a useful day though, as I patched five holes in my Big Agnes AXL sleeping pad after testing it in the tub. A new hole appeared each time I patched the last. I didn't bother testing after the fifth because I knew there'd be another. All were the same type - a pinprick hole at the edge of a dimple in the top of the pad. Not due to abrasion or puncture, just a general weakening of the seams or material after 40-45 nights of use. A material defect in my view, and I'll be returning it as soon as I can get a new pad.
Speaking of repairs, I did replace my phone with the shattered camera lens. The new one, Moto G Power, supposedly has the longest battery life around, plus has a better camera than anything short of a premium phone. So now I have no excuses for lousy pictures!
I won't be getting a new sleeping pad for at least four more days, though, since the local REIs are all out of stock on ultralight pads. So in the meantime I'll keep reinflating the AXL every two hours during the night and hope for the best. I ordered the Thermarest Xlite, by far the most popular thruhiker pad. And in hindsight the one I should have bought to begin with, given its reputation for durability. 
My daughter Larisa, aka Snickers, is joining me today and tomorrow. She's completing 15 and 20 mile hikes for her Hiking merit badge on her path to Eagle Scout. Yes, not only do I have three boys in the boy scouts (now called Scouts BSA), but my daughter as well. She's also a girl scout, and is aiming for the highest rank in each: Eagle Scout and Gold Award. 
There was some trepidation this morning when we awoke to rain, but the storm system hitting the Philadelphia area was moving up the coast and had missed the trail. So we were soon on our way. Sara dropped us off at the parking lot near Eckville where my younger boys and I had left the trail last week. 
Snickers and I were in good spirits enjoying the cool temperature (high of 73) and relatively low humidity. A short but steep climb took us back up to the Blue Mountain ridgeline near the Hawk Mountain sanctuary. Then the fun began. The next four miles were mostly rocks, with some boulder stretches mixed in. Challenging mentally to stay focused on foot placement. But at least there were dry. Snickers had a store of you-know-whats to keep up her blood sugar throughout the day.
Had a long break at the Allentown Shelter and enjoyed four miles of easy Jeep track to route 309 where we had huge burgers at the new Thunderhead Inn and filled our bottles at their spigot. The owner was very accommodating, offering us electronics charging and inviting us to bring our packs in. 
Just before the road I spied a party balloon hovering right at the edge of the trail with Happy Birthday on it and tied to a cellophane gift bag. It must have escaped from a party a few days ago and landed here. Since it was my 47th birthday just yesterday, I took it as a birthday wish from the trail. The trail really does provide, sometimes in the most unexpected ways. We took a picture then disposed of it in the dumpster at the restaurant. If the helium had still been lighter than air I could have tied it to my pack and actually saved a few ounces!
It was past 7:30 when we left, having covered under 13 miles since 10:30 thanks to all the rocks. The two miles north of 309 were more Jeep track, and we pulled out the headlamps a mile in. Originally we had planned to tent at the New Tripoli site downhill from a power line but, since we didn't need water and the site was way down the mountain, we just pushed another quarter mile to a site right on trail on the ridge. Unfortunately after the power line the ridge turned into a mess of boulders, testing our patience and our headlamps. We finally reached the tentsite well after dark and quickly set up and crawled in for a well-earned rest. 
Fifteen miles - check!","side trail to Pine Swamp Rd parking
",Tentsite at 1248.6,"Aug 16, Sun",14.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630043,"Change of plans. Snickers and I decided we won't make 20 miles in this rocky terrain. Snickers will do a local hike back home on more manageable terrain. She'll hike three miles to Bake Oven Road today and get picked up. She was a real trooper yesterday enduring one of the quintessential Rocksylvania stretches of the trail, but today looks at least as challenging and no one except a thruhiker needs that kind of grief.
Snickers didn't get off easy though because that three miles started with rocks and crescendoed in the Knife Edge - a long, difficult ledge outcropping with layers at an angle. We picked our way across it very slowly. There was a good view, but we weren't in the mood to stop. Snickers was perplexed why anyone would put a trail through here. I remember feeling the same way the first time I came through.
We arrived at the Bake Oven parking lot just seconds before Sara. I gave Snickers and her a big hug as I won't see them in person until likely October. Then they were off in a cloud of dust and I was alone again. I should be getting used to this. I hiked off to Bake Oven Knob lost in my thoughts about the family.
A mile over the graffitied rocks, another Knife Edge-like boulder field, I was still lost in my thoughts and just following the rocks on automatic pilot when suddenly I heard a blood-chilling rattle that ended my reverie. A rattlesnake was right in front of me sunning on the rocks! I had been about to step right next to him. I retreated to a safe distance, then took out my camera. He gave me another rattle, this time not of warning but of annoyance. He began to slither away, not appreciating my presence. After a few seconds I moved on, and he rattled one last time as if to say ""Good riddance!""
A couple of miles later at Ashfield Road, after another large boulder field, I came upon a large cache of water - two dozen gallon jugs. A trail angel named Mun has been maintaining these at several road crossings. The water in this stretch is little and far between. And always requires a long walk downhill and back again. So far I've avoided any of these side errands by filling up in town, at the 309 restaurant, and generally by acting like a camel. The cooler weather has helped. These caches ensure I will have easy water to the state line. 
Once again I got lost in my thoughts walking along the ridge over the Pennsylvania turnpike's Lehigh tunnel. Here the trail was somewhat pleasant with few rocks and open to the sky, but hemmed in tightly by thick understory. Suddenly movement caught my eye. It was the shaggy black hindquarters of a very large bear! He, and it had to be a he, was walking along the trail twenty yards ahead and disappearing around a bend. My mind went in four directions at once. What do I do? Turn back? Bushwhack around him? Yell for help? Charge? I decided to make a lot of noise so he'd know I was here, and hopefully he would decide he didn't want anything to do with me. 
I clacked my poles together and rang them on the rocks exuberantly. I hoped this sounded intimidating and not interesting to Mr. Bear. Slowly I approached the bend and rounded it. No bear on trail. The foliage was thick on both sides and I scanned wildly for any sign of movement. Finally I spied him off to the right under a tree some fifty feet away. He was a big one, a full-grown well-fed Papa Bear. I made more racket, and he turned and bounded away a few yards then slowed to a walk and disappeared. First the rattler now this. Both seemed rather annoyed with me. I was disappointed not to get any video, but it all happened so fast.
A steep downhill over loose rock brought me into the Lehigh River gap. A construction crew was replacing a power line tower on the west side of the gap as I hiked through. Their sign helpfully warned hikers as the trail crossed their makeshift access road to ""Watch Your Step"". Then the trail left the even gravel bed of the road and returned to navigating a field of loose scree. If a hiker needs to be told to watch his step he wouldn't be on this section of trail to begin with.
After crossing the Lehigh River on the road bridge I followed a side trail into Palmerton for a mile and a half. It was a nice level walk on an old rail bed above the river. Someone had painted a huge smiley face on a boulder along the way. Palmerton is a neat mid-sized town laid out on a grid with an historic downtown. But I was only there for the food. Iced tea, ice cream, a cheese steak, plus an Italian hoagie for the road. I hung out at the sandwich place for awhile before hiking back to trail. A grizzled, gap-toothed retired zinc plant worker outside the convenience store was interested in my hike. He said he was too old and unhealthy to do anything like it. I started to encourage him but stopped. Attitudes like that come from within over a long period of time. Instead I asked him about the zinc plant, which is largely closed now. The mountain behind it, which the trail follows, is still being restored after being defoliated from zinc contamination. Every time I'm up here it seems greener.
A thunder shower hit as I walked back to trail and it rained lightly as I climbed up the bouldery trail. There's a section that requires some hand-over-hand climbing. I have no good way to quickly stow my poles when this happens. I'll need to figure something out before New Hampshire.
Once through all the rocks the ridgeline was easy walking, though the thick grass and brush soaked my feet. Several miles later I reached Little Gap where another water cache from Mun gave me enough to dry camp tonight. There I met two southbounders - a black-bearded guy named Slip and a girl named Poncho - hiking from Hanover, New Hampshire to Georgia. Said there were a ton of blowdowns in New York thanks to the tropical storm. 
A few more miles in I became frustrated with my slow pace over the rocky trail as dusk approached. There was already a tent at the campsite by the Delps Trail I had been heading for. So I searched around until I found another overgrown tentsite nearby. Ate the hoagie I'd carried out from Joe's in Palmerton. And hung the bear bag after remembering the Papa Bear I'd seen earlier.","Tentsite at 1248.6

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630044,"Woke around 7:30. Saw an emergency alert on my phone from last night warning of tornadoes in the area and to seek hard cover. I knew it had poured, had even gotten up in the wee hours to secure the tent flaps, but the wind was never very strong. 
My sleeping pad survived another night, with the assistance of several reinflations. It lasts an hour or two before it bottoms out again.
I met the occupants of the other tent at Delps shortly after hiking out before 9. Sugar Gal (after the cakes she bakes at home) and Swamp Irish are a retired couple from Louisiana. They started in Georgia, got off in March, got back on in Harpers Ferry. Will flip again up to Katahdin before it closes and finish the rest southbound. They had stayed in Palmerton and hiked to Delps yesterday, setting up their tent just before the early evening thunder shower hit. Then afterwards moved it to dig out all the rocks underneath. They are definitely frustrated with the rocks here and can't wait to get out of Pennsylvania. 
Approaching Smith Gap I crossed paths with Bight (Byte?), a young guy hiking Delaware Water Gap to Virginia. He didn't see the water cache at Smith Gap and took a forty minute round-trip to a spring to get water. Shows what a blessing these water caches are. With the relatively cool weather though I'm drinking very little. I carried an extra liter all day just in case but never needed it.
Today was almost solid rocks. Rocks, rocks, rocks. Mostly it was a carpet of bumpy protrusions requiring careful and tedious stepping that gradually ground down my feet and thighs. There were only a few bouldery areas requiring hopping or climbing. Wolf Rocks was the most extensive, and very buggy, but with little view. Immediately after Wolf the trail became beautifully smooth, soft dirt winding through a fern understory. But it lasted less than half a mile before degrading back to rocks and invasive undergrowth.
The trail took a very twisty and fatiguing side hill route around Tott's Gap, apparently a recent relocation. It finally deposited me on a dirt road along the ridge which I followed for a wonderful one and a half miles to Mount Minsi, overlooking the Delaware water gap. Here a number of dayhikers appeared and there were numerous views, the first good ones in 23 miles. There were a number of kayaks and rafts drifting downriver late in the day. I could see the excursion company waiting for them on a beach around the riverbend. They are in the photo if you look closely.
The mountain opposite the river has exposed cliffs that show the layers of bedrock angled at 45 degrees. What massive force it took to create this. The whole Kittatinny ridge as well as Blue Mountain and all the other Allegheny folds must look similar underneath. And the dramatic thousand foot drop to the river shows what time and water can do to even the most imposing of mountain ridges.
Down in Delaware Water Gap, where I arrived near 7 after a long and exhausting day, the tourist-based town was practically closed on a Tuesday. Several restaurants were closed for the day, the pizza joint closed early at 7, the Village Farmer, home of trail-famous sandwiches, closed their grill at 7, the Dunkin Donuts had closed their kitchen by 7, and even the two convenience stores were closed by 8. At least the motel was open! I scrounged a premade turkey pot pie from Village Farmer which turned out to be pretty decent, but it wasn't the lobster roll or calzone I'd been looking forward to.
The motel had their pool open, but I had to do laundry and had no clothes to spare for a swim. In fact I had no clothes to spare at all. I walked back and forth to the laundry room in a bath towel, puffy, and flip-flops. Classic hiker trash style. Fortunately there weren't many people around. Took advantage of the AC to dry out the tent and other equipment scattered around the room. The management made a good move putting in faux-wood floors.","Tentsite at Delps Trail

I missed a morning drizzle in Delaware Water Gap thanks to my motel stay. The mountains were covered in clouds. My tent and all the other gear dried out nicely in the AC, and I managed to clean up enough dirt and debris to look like a normal car tourist had stayed there. Grabbed breakfast at Dunkin Donuts next door and took my time packing up. I'm really not good at getting out of town early. Must have been 10:30 by the time I left.
The I-80 bridge over the Delaware River vibrated with traffic as I walked along the narrow pedestrian cattleshoot. Halfway across the state line is painted on the pavement. I'm now in New Jersey, my eighth state! 
The national park office was closed but the trailhead was full of cars, even on a Wednesday morning. New Jersey started out on a good note. I walked up the picturesque Dunnfield Creek before an easy climb up to the ridge, where forest alternated with open bedrock stretches.  
I spied a deer on the trail ahead staring at me as if caught in the headlights. As I approached I saw three more were strung out along the trail, including one or two still with spots, all frozen in place watching me. I walked slowly and nonchalantly pulled out my camera. But as I raised it, as if on signal, all four turned in unison and bolted into the brush. What a scene!
Sunfish Pond is billed as New Jersey's only glacial pond, a remnant of the last Ice Age. No swimming is permitted so as not to disturb the unique habitat. The trail around the shore is rocky and full of snakes. I only saw black rat snakes, but I'm sure there were rattlers lurking where I heard unseen movement.
As I progressed slowly, stopping to set up timer shots and gaze over the water, I got to thinking how I've started planning the remainder of the hike a little too closely. I had calculated I must average 22 miles a day to New Hampshire, 15 a day through the Whites, etc. to get to Katahdin by October 7th. That means I should get to the Hudson in five days. Stay at a hostel in two days. Resupply here, here, and here. It all leaves little room for spontaneity. Yesterday's marathon trudge made good time, but left me feeling empty. I need to cover the miles, sure, but I also need to remain flexible and let life happen. 
So I walked into the AMC Mohican Center after ten miles feeling a little played out. It's been a gorgeous day for hiking - partly sunny, high seventies, low humidity - and already New Jersey has had scenic creeks, lakes, a glacial pond and open ridges with a 360 degree view. So why am I run down?
The caretaker took my food order and asked if wanted to stay the night. ""No, no!"" I laughed, ""I'd love to but I'd never get to Maine!"" It was an automatic response generated by my inner scheduler. I relaxed on a sofa while the food was made and charged my phone. It was quiet, but a steady stream of hikers went by, some staying in cabins and others dayhiking. Got to talking with a backpacker named Bumblebee who started in Shenandoah last month and hiked most of the AT last year. He convinced me to join him tenting at a firetower just a couple miles away. My plan had me hiking 14 more miles. But given it was already 5 in the afternoon (where did the time go?), that wasn't happening.
So I walked up to the firetower and pitched my tent on the grassy lawn, trying to avoid the rocks buried throughout. A dayhiker chatted and left, then two guys from central Jersey came up, having ridden mountain bikes much of the way. The very Jersey-tawkin' guy and his teenage stepson were on a little adventure and were in wide-eyed awe of the ridge, the view, the firetower, the AT, and the fact that we could camp here. They climbed the tower with a GoPro and had a lot of trouble with the height, couldn't get more than halfway. They settled in on the lawn for the sunset but, having no headlamps, had to leave early to find their way back to the car. Promised they were coming back here to camp the next day.
Another backpacker came in, a German who's lived in Princeton for several years. He's out for several days. Went down the ridge a bit to set up a hammock. 
The sky was clear and the sunset was like molten iron sinking into the hill. After awhile some stars peeped out, and eventually became a chorus. A chill wind picked up and drove me into the tent, puffy on and sleeping bag pulled up. I could use my winter gear tonight.","Delaware Water Gap
",Catfish firetower,"Aug 19, Wed",12.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630105,"It was cold last night. Mid 50s. Hope this isn't a sign of an early winter. 
Armen, the German section hiker, was up early and climbing the fire tower, helping to get me up in time for the sunrise. He is a molecular biologist with a Japanese pharma in Princeton and partners with university researchers who've made breakthroughs they want to take to market. He's out for five days and seems to be planning around visiting lakes he can swim in.
A hiker burst through soon after sunrise. He was shabby and mud-stained and obviously a thruhiker, but going the wrong direction. He turned out to have come from Maine. My first SOBO! Calls himself Blind and started from the base of Katahdin on June 6, about the same time I started at Springer. Plans to  go back to hike Katahdin.
I've been seeing more backpackers the last two days. Maybe it's this area or maybe it's the cooler weather. For the middle of the week it's surprising. Weather today was clear, calm, and cool in the forest. 
I hiked 16 miles to Branchville. Decided to resupply at Dale's Market a mile or so south instead of pushing thirty miles today to get into Port Jervis. I am out of snacks and breakfast entirely. Grabbed a huge calzone at Jimmy's Pizza next door and downed a two liter Coke. I never drink soda at home, but anything cold is good. Had to eat outside and the sun had me sweating. Grabbed a milkshake at Jumboland Diner on the two mile walk back north to Gyp's Tavern. There I picked up my new sleeping pad. I had sent it further up trail in case the shipping was delayed. But it came two days ago as promised. I could have sent it to Delaware Water Gap. Oh, well.
Found Bumblebee behind Gyp's by the lake. He was three beers and a burger in and was loving life. He bought a six-pack of IPAs ""to go"", gave me a couple, and we each downed one on the spot  It wasn't bad for an IPA. I'm usually more of a lager guy. I didn't plan to drink the other, but carried it up the trail to give it back later to repay the favor.
Climbed back to the ridge. As I reached the top a family was just ahead and the little girl was very excited about having climbed the mountain. I encouraged her by asking if she'd really just climbed this big mountain. She beamed and nodded and said it was her mommy's idea. I said her mom had some good ideas and be sure to listen to her. Then I coolly exited by spending three minutes trying to figure out where the trail left the open bedrock area.
The Culver firetower was a mile further. Bumblebee caught up and gushed about his experience here last year, where apparently some amateur radio enthusiast shindig was going on for several days, and he got beef stew out of it. It had a great view, but I didn't want another cold night on the exposed ridge. I dried the condensation off my tent in the early evening sun, then hiked another mile down to the shelter. 
There I met Ducky for the second time, having seen her right before Branchville. She's hiking all of the New Jersey AT with her pooch, and has a glittery duck hanging from her pack. She also has some very loud and annoying alerts on her phone which chimed out in the shelter well after dark. Trail courtesy people!","Catfish firetower
",Gren Anderson Shelter,"Aug 20, Thu",18.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630110,"Sometime before dawn a hiker walked by the shelter to get water, but I barely stirred. But at 6:30 Ducky's husband Chatterbox walked in to surprise her. He drove through the night from York, Pennsylvania to support her last two days on trail. Their two little terriers Lulu (Muddy Butt from jumping in the streams) and Cody (Muddy Paws) explored the shelter and got me up. Ducky needs to get back on Monday to drive a school bus, as most kids in her district are going back to school.
Chatterbox brought McDonald's and gave me a breakfast biscuit as well as a liter of Gatorade to, as Ducky said, make up for waking me up last night with all his calls. Good trade, I think. Thanks, Chatterbox!
I hiked into the cool morning air - though not as cool as yesterday - about twelve miles to High Point State Park. Followed a very rocky trail through dense brush to the beach on Marcia Lake and had a refreshing swim. Dozens of families were set up on the lawn, swimming, fishing, and picknicking. Plus the snack bar was open! The lady there was very friendly. When I asked where to dispose of the trash from my hot dog, soft pretzel, soda, and ice cream pop she pointed to yellow bags and explained the park requires visitors to pack it out. ""That's alright,"" I said. ""I'm hiking so I'm used to that."" ""Oh! You're a hiker?"" she perked up. ""Then I'll take your trash! And you can fill up on water here and you can use the showers. We get a lot of hikers through here."" So it was well worth the side trip.
Later I passed a woman with two large dogs coming down to Greenville Road, and found a cooler marked ""Trail Magic"". That's three times in one day! This is the first cooler I've run across that actually had anything in it. Gatorade, V8, peanut butter crackers, Oreos, Cheetos, and two flavors of applesauce. I downed a Gatorade and slurped up an applesauce before moving on, being sure to text a thank you to the trail angels who left it.
Skirted a series of pastures, where I heard only the sound of crickets. Orange and black butterflies danced and flitted around me. This section wound past bucolic fields, marshes with bog bridges and wildflowers, old barns, and undisturbed backroads.
I found the ""secret shelter"" and made a friend in year-round resident Jake the donkey. He seemed to really like me, or maybe it was just my Chex mix. But he also eats grass, so he's not that picky. The property owner Jim, a thruhiker from '89, is very generous in opening the shelter and water spigot to passing hikers.
Hiked another mile and a half to Unionville. There I shipped my defective Big Agnes AXL sleeping pad back to REI at the post office,  then stopped for dinner at Annabel's pizza joint. Very busy on a Friday evening.
Walked the road out of town to meet the trail a mile down. It was very narrow and had occasional high speed traffic. I don't recommend it. Jump on the trail in town - it follows an old rail bed for much of the way out.
As I was climbing up from Oil City Rd I scared up a small adult bear. He scampered a ways then looked back. I took out my camera and he scampered further. I don't know how anyone gets a good shot of one of these guys without a telephoto lens or a death wish.
The sun was low in the sky as I walked around Wallkill Preserve, giving everything a golden glow. Swans and egrets floated on the shimmering water. A man walking his dog chatted me up and told me not to miss camping at the Warwick Drive-In. Hmm. Wasn't in my plan, but it sounds interesting. If I don't do that kind of thing on a thruhike when would I ever do it?
Got water from the spigot of an abandoned house owned by the park service on the way up Pochuck Mountain. It's the official water source for the shelter. A 2015 thruhiker named Troutman was already in the shelter, and two tents were nearby. Troutman is a near grandmaster chess player and makes a living off tournaments and teaching. Looks to be in his mid-twenties. Turns out he was the guy who passed my shelter early this morning. The shelter was lousy with mosquitos so I cut the evening short and buried myself in my sleeping bag liner. Even got up an hour later to spray on Picaridin to ward off the bloodsuckers. Warm night.","Gren Anderson Shelter
",Pochuck Mountain Shelter,"Aug 21, Fri",25.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630145,"The humidity began rising yesterday afternoon, stayed through a warm night, and followed me out this morning. The mosquitos hung around most of the night so I kept myself cocooned in my liner.
A retired couple from Georgia was tenting next to the shelter. They've been hiking sections in each state and have gotten as far north as this. Not trying to walk every mile, just get the flavor.
Aside from some pasture and marsh walks in the middle, New Jersey is a continuation of Pennsylvania terrain on one side and a preview of New York on the other. The first few miles from Pochuck Mountain roller-coastered, New York-like, up and over small rocky knobs and ridges, occasionally taking unexpected turns. 
Then came a beautiful marsh walk over a mile-long boardwalk. Lots of walkers out on this sunny Saturday morning. Cattails dominated the marsh, with strokes of purple and yellow wildflowers throughout. 
At the road I headed to Mitch's Roadside Grill. Dozens of cars already lined the road at this popular trailhead, near the Stairway to Heaven. Mitch was sitting out under an umbrella by his hot dog stand but wasn't ready to cook yet. It was only 10:30. So I crossed the street to get an ice cream at Heaven Hill Farm and charge my power brick. An hour later I came back and got my dogs, along with some life counseling from Mitch. He doesn't sell hot dogs to make a living, he sells hot dogs to meet and talk to people. And he's full of sound advice, the kind you need to hear, not necessarily want to hear.
So I had that to think about as I threaded through the dayhikers up the Stairway, a steep 600-foot-gain rock-hopping delight that leaves you panting but with a sense of satisfaction. The trail rolled over a few small hills after that, staying rocky, until it emptied me on the Warwick Turnpike. 
A dog walker in Wallkill last night had urged me to camp at the Warwick Drive-In so, having never done any such thing, I figured it might be an interesting highlight. It messed up my schedule a bit, since it would now take me another day to get to the Hudson. I'd only come 12 miles today. But I don't want this hike to turn into a race against time at the expense of a good experience. I looked at this as a test of the kind of hike this would be. 
Hitching was initially difficult. Dayhikers had taken up the shoulder near the trailhead and the road was too narrow for anyone to stop. So I walked about a half mile until I decided the road was just too narrow and sketchy to walk the whole way. I found a gravel shoulder in front of a small farm and stuck out my thumb. About fifty cars passed in waves and caravans before an SUV pulled over. A local named Sal had two little kids in the back but he invited me to jump in the wayback which I gratefully did. He dropped me two miles later at the ShopRite next to the theater where I got a late lunch of fresh fruit and sushi. 
A couple people stopped as I ate on the curb in the shady side of the market, including a guy named Mark who offered me a ride back in the morning.
After scoping out the drive-in and meeting the owner Pop-pop, who offered water, a charging outlet, and free radio rental for the movie in addition to tenting, I headed directly across the street to the Pennington Beer Garden, part of their farm market. It was a busy Saturday evening but I was able to sit down and enjoy a lobster roll of all things. I finally got what I'd been craving in Delaware Water Gap. 
Headed back to the supermarket for another half-gallon of iced tea. Here in the north not only do they have unsweetened tea, but unsweetened tea flavored with lemon, my favorite! Leaving the store I was surprised to find another thruhiker on a bench eating Chinese from the prepared foods aisle.
Poison is the first legal southbounder. He left Katahdin on July 1st and the only hiker ahead of him, a multi-time AT thruhiker named Hambone, got off after New Hampshire to raft the Mississippi instead. He's a recent college grad from North Carolina who started hiking in Georgia in February, then stopped in Damascus when the ATC asked hikers to get off, largely because his friend and hiking partner wanted to. But his friend went back to the trail in May without telling him, so he decided to southbound and do the entire trail. He doesn't feel right about stopping in Damascus after leaving trail for several months. And he's got plans to hike the CDT next year and after that who knows? Aims to do it all before family and responsibility hit. 
We joined up at the drive-in, set up our tents on a small rise behind all the cars with an excellent view of all three movies (you choose which audio to listen to), but mainly spent the next four hours in deep conversation about life, the kind of conversation you only have with a perfect stranger when you're both on the trail going through the same experience. Both of us have been alone for much of our hikes, so there was some pent up desire for socialization there. A very pleasant way to pass the evening. A bucket of buttery popcorn helped too.","Pochuck Mountain Shelter
",Warwick Turnpike (Warwick),"Aug 22, Sat",12
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630177,"Woke at dawn, very quiet despite the nearby road on a Sunday morning. Packed up, called Mark the shuttle guy who had offered me a ride back to trail yesterday, and went to the Bagel Shop with Poison. I was pleasantly surprised to see they had a lox bagel, one of my favorites. One of the benefits of trekking past New York City.
Poison decided to zero at the drive-in. I was hiking by 8:30. The trail was rough and climbed sharply up and down bedrock ridges. Within an hour I was across the New York state line, a simple paint line on the bedrock. The trail rose and dipped over rock outcroppings, some with views of Greenwood Lake, a large boating and vacation home area. A few dayhikers and a handful of backpackers had ventured this far from the road. 
After ten miles I reached route 17 and immediately headed for the Bellvale creamery for a milkshake. The line was long with weekend business. Recharged my brick while I slurped up the cold creamy goodness. Stopped for a hot dog at the small stand by the trailhead on the way back. All told I spent almost two hours in the area. But with over sixteen miles to my intended destination of Fingerboard Shelter I was burning daylight. Time to move on. 
Three men at the trailhead asked me where the trail was. Then which direction they should go. Well, how far do you want to go? I sent them back the way I'd come since they had the whole afternoon, but wondered if they'd make it the three or four miles to the views. I warned them to follow the blazes since the trail took sharp turns. ""What's a blaze?"" the older guy asked. I hope they don't require search and rescue.
About seven miles from the road I ran across two southbounders about a mile apart: Flanders and Butters. Both young guys, they had started from the base of Katahdin together in June before the summit opened. They were excited to learn they were about to catch Poison in Warwick at the drive-in. He'd started July 1st and passed them at some point. Butters said they planned to hike Katahdin during the winter when it reopens for ice-axe mountaineering.
The trail over these next ten miles seemed to be all rocks, boulders, and bedrock. Plus many, many blowdowns from the tropical storm three weeks ago. Huge trees and branches blocked the trail and made for some head-scratching moments to relocate the path. When the trail ran straight up a bouldery slope with multiple trees felled across it, it was even more of a puzzle to find the way. 
There were numerous sharp climbs and harrowing descents over bedrock-topped ridges. The descent from Arden Mountain was the steepest. I couldn't help but slip a few times despite taking great care because the grade was so high. Even so, I was proud of conquering Arden again. The first time I hit this stretch during a long section hike three years ago I was in a similar position - near the end of a long, tough day, fatigued by heat and humidity and the constant ups and downs, and trying to finish more miles to reach the shelter. That time I lost it in frustration at the difficult climbs, the unexpected and poorly marked turns in the trail, the rocks, and the tricky descents. I had to stealth camp soon after getting past it, and I wound up making an unplanned stop in the next town to regroup.  I had since built up Arden as a monumental task, but in reality it was less than two miles and had only a couple moderate climbs so it took well under an hour. Even the descent was only bad for a couple hundred yards.
But the sun was relentlessly dropping, and in these valleys I knew darkness would come even earlier. I looked up Fingerboard Shelter in Guthooks and found there was a camping prohibition because of aggressive bear issues there. So not a good idea to stay there anyway. I walked a couple more miles into Harriman State Park and found a stealth site near Island Pond hidden from the trail and the gravel access road. Apparently dispersed camping is not permitted in this area. But with the shelter closed where am I supposed to camp? I made sure to hang the bear bag well. I don't need any nighttime visitors.","Warwick Turnpike (Warwick)
",Stealth site at Island Pond,"Aug 23, Sun",23.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630178,"I'd pitched the tent on a patch of moss last night, probably the softest pitch this whole hike. I didn't stir until about 7:30, and only then thanks to the sun hitting me directly, and finally got my butt on the trail around 9. Had no bear issues in this area of known problem bears. My bear bag was unmolested in the tree. Maybe the odor-proof bags I use actually work, or maybe it's just luck I've never had anything get into my food bag.
I ran out of breakfast foods a few days ago, something which hasn't mattered with the town food available in the deli run here. But this morning I had no options so I dug into my snacks. This is important for later.
The trail remained extremely rocky, comparable to anything in Pennsylvania, with the added joy of frequent abrupt climbs and drops. A very exhausting kind of hiking, both physically and mentally. After four miles I turned down Arden Valley Road to Lake Tiorati. There I treated myself to a soda and ice cream from the vending machines. Still early in the day, but I needed it already. Not a good sign. 
The lake beach was closed and gated off, but I really wanted to cool down. So I found the thruhiker entrance, a point on the far side from the road where the stone wall of the bathhouse made for easy climbing over the chain link fence. It was just a quick dip, and I was out in two minutes, but it cleaned me up a bit and reenergized me somewhat. It's also a little invigorating to jump a fence once in a while, even at my age.
The chipmunks and squirrels have been busy the last couple days. For weeks I hadn't seen much of them. Probably hanging out in their shady hovels. But they must detect the lower sun and other signs of the coming autumn. Time to get back to work filling the food stores. It seems every time I come around a bend or over a rise one or more go scattering off into the leaves. 
The landscape here is unusual. Most of the forest understory is bare or grassy. The trail often goes over exposed bedrock, usually in full sun. The high plateaus feel like open parks. But in the gulleys (valley is too grand a word) between the rocky ridges there are sometimes bogs or streams and the forest seems protective and welcoming. If not for the tough hiking it would be a delightful tour. 
The rocks and lack of understory makes the trail harder to follow. There is often no obvious trail worn into the dirt so I had to pay careful attention to blazes, which were usually faded and not frequent enough in places. This has led to hikers going off trail and creating wide areas of erosion, or false trails leading to nowhere as hikers make the same mistake when the trail veers unexpectedly, as it very often did.
I passed two shelters but neither had privies. This is very unusual. Maybe it's difficult to dig a large enough pit in this rocky soil. It was hard enough to dig a hole!
I passed two more southbounders. Irish Bastard and Rock Steady are young guys who started July 1st, so were in the first group to legally climb Katahdin. They planned to overnight at Fingerboard Shelter, where the active bears are. 
Ten miles in I climbed West Mountain. It was only 600 feet but steep and I felt it. I let out a very loud Yawp at the top. The mountain didn't let up. The ridge was bumpy and full of sharp climbs over ledges. The downhill was long and rocky. Nearly to the road I got sloppy and let my one foot get caught by my other. I very nearly went flying into the rocks. How I recovered I don't know, but there were some very long strides and some loud exclamations involved.
The climb up Bear Mountain was even worse. This is not a hard climb. It starts with an old carriage road, then about 150 vertical feet of rock stairs, then 200 more feet spread over a mile of highly manicured trail. But I was so wiped out I had to just sit down for twenty minutes. I needed another rest just a few minutes later. I'd been rationing the water I'd gotten at Tiorati's spigot and it was nearly gone. I knew I was thirsty and hungry. But I didn't want to eat without water to wash it down, and there wasn't enough for that. 
I checked the tiny thermometer I carry (/compass/whistle). 90 degrees! Well, that and the humidity and fifteen miles of gnarly trail explains everything. Not surprising. The same thing happened to me coming through this section three years ago in June. Southern New York is not to be taken lightly. And can be downright dangerous in a dry humid summer.
I drove myself on, knowing there were vending machines at the summit. Tourists can drive up Bear Mountain to the tower, and being so close to New York City it's usually very busy.
But the vending machines had no power. The summit was closed to traffic. The bathrooms were closed. There was no water, anywhere. The park staff was still cleaning up downed trees from the storm three weeks ago. I spied a park ranger in a truck and went over to ask about water. With literally a cup of water and already running a huge deficit I knew the two miles down to town were going to be rough. The maintenance guy talking to her explained the power was down and there was no water at all. My face must have told the story. He had barely finished when the ranger handed me a cold bottled water from her cooler. I don't know if it was from her personal stash or her rescue kit for desperate hikers, but either way she saved me a lot of pain. Teach me to rely on any one water source on a day like this.
The small bottle made only a dent in my bottomless thirst, but it was enough to perk me up and get me down the mountain. Plenty of dayhikers were still climbing, even at 4 in the afternoon, though far fewer than on a weekend. I didn't even get a picture from the summit. My only thought was to get to the refreshments at Hessian Lake and then to the motel. 
Plenty of families picknicking and boating around the lake, though again a mere fraction of a weekend. After getting my sugar hit at the soda machine I tried to follow the trail through the zoo but it had closed at 4. So I called the motel and got picked up near the bridge. Coincidentally the ranger lady drove by in her truck while I was waiting and stopped to make sure I was okay. What a good person.
Walking into the air-conditioned room at Bear Mountain Bridge Motel was like Nirvana. I just laid down in front of the wall unit for a few minutes before even getting to the shower. The guy who'd picked me up brought me a chilled water bottle, remembering I suppose my story about dehydrating on the summit. Another good person.
Grandpa, who runs the place, usually picks hikers up but he had a bout of vertigo today. He took in my laundry and made me feel at home. I got Italian delivered and over-ordered. The 12"" pizza disappeared quickly but the calzone and sub had to wait. I probably should have eaten something before I ordered. Good thing there's no supermarket nearby or my resupply would have been twenty pounds.","Stealth site at Island Pond

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630229,"Recharged by air conditioning and copious amounts of Italian food at Bear Mountain Bridge Motel, I was driven back to trail by Grandpa's son to the Bear Mountain Inn. I hung out til the zoo opened at 10:30 and followed the white blazes through. The bear cage, the lowest point in the AT at just 124 feet, had no bears but was full of vultures. Hmm.
Hiked over the Hudson, a truly grand river, on the Bear Mountain Bridge. It was completed in 1924, one year after the first section of the AT was built here. A few easy miles followed over to route 9, where someone has written on a blank trail sign ""This is a good sign"". Considering there's a deli just beyond it, I agree.
Outside at the picnic tables I met Bolt for the second time. He's a NYC carpenter who builds scaffolding for skyscrapers, and is going northbound from the Mason-Dixon line. He was waiting for his girlfriend to pick him up for a couple days off trail, but he hasn't seen any other northbounders for a very long time and wanted to hike with me for a few miles. I appreciated the company. He's pretty pessimistic on the city's future. From his point of view all the people who can leave are leaving and never coming back. I'm skeptical. People have thought New York was down and out before but it's always come back. And medically it's already gone through its epidemic. Why people would run off to areas in earlier stages of the curve I don't know. 
Bolt got off at a back road an hour or so later to wait for his girlfriend, but I passed more hikers. Such as a southbounder named Trash Mango or Tango who started July 1st.
I was dragging again by mid-afternoon. Still lots of rocks and ups and downs. Doesn't seem much easier than south of the Hudson. Nearing my destination of Lake Canopus the trail followed an old mining road. It was so level it cut through and along the side of the hill and spanned gulleys over a crib wall. It's a good model for the rest of the New York AT!
But it didn't last long . The last two miles around Lake Canopus were very rough. It finally emptied me on the beach at the north end. It was empty, parking lot closed for the night. As I wandered up to the complex looking for water a woman called out to me. She was a southbounder named Gravity, thruhiking with her fourteen-year-old son Dr. Duck. He tweaked his knee so they've been going slower lately. They were tenting in a grassy area away from the beach.
I pitched the tent on the beach by the boat dock where the shore protrudes into the lake, surrounded on three sides by water. The quarter moon was rising over the lake providing all the illumination I needed. I had some of the calzone I'd over-ordered last night and packed out. Surprisingly the cheese held up very well encased in the dough shell.","US 9 (Fort Montgomery)
",Lake Canopus Beach,"Aug 25, Tue",20.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630230,"Woke briefly on Lake Canopus beach to a scratching sound outside my tent, like a mouse was chewing on my guylines. But it was just the breeze rustling the fabric. The sky was clear and lots of stars were visible, even 50 miles from Times Square. One particularly bright one early morning in the east must have been a planet.
After rising at first light to make sure my tent was down before the beach opened, I took an early morning swim. The air was cool, in the high 50s, but the water was pleasantly warm. I shivered a bit while air drying, finishing off the last of my calzone. Watched a bald eagle soar around the far side of the beach.
A few miles into the day I crossed paths with Lady Slippers and Wanderlost. They had hiked to Katahdin from Pawling, and had just flipped back to Pawling to finish the trail southbound. I thought they were dayhikers as they approached because they were out-of-shape and their worn packs were so small they weren't visible from the front. They chatted me up, catching me by surprise but think I came across as distracted. I have to be more careful about jumping to conclusions.
There was a deli and pizza place a half mile off trail in the middle of my day so of course I spent some time there. Packed out a ""wedge"" (or hoagie, as it's properly called) for dinner. Funny how I probably wouldn't go half a mile off trail for most views. But put a deli there and you got me.
After New York I'm never complaining about downed trees again. My favorite is when the tree pulls up a huge mound of dirt that contains the trail, leaving a gaping hole to traverse. Also interesting are the blowdowns that take down other trees or fall on earlier blowdowns, creating a kind of giant game of  pick-up-sticks for you to squeeze through or climb over. After a few years of this there would be no trail if not for maintainers regularly clearing them out. Imagine what the first thruhiker Earl Schaffer encountered in 1948 after nearly a decade of neglect around WWII.
Met a couple of section hikers at Morgan Stewart Shelter. Richard is a fiftyish southbounder who claims he is just ""messin' around"" and doesn't care how far he gets. He seemed as interested in deli locations as I am. The other guy is doing a shakedown for a thruhike he hopes to attempt next year, figuring out what he does and doesn't need. Richard's answer? ""All you need is a credit card. Just buy what you need when you need it. That way you won't bring anything extra.""
I soon caught up with a girl named Giggles sitting on a wooden bridge over a gurgling stream, the best water I've seen all day. She's sectioning currently. Hiked 1400 miles to the Hudson last year but had to get off to start at Georgetown Law. Classes start again on Monday. 
A few miles north at Nuclear Lake I swam in the dark, warm waters. While I dried off in the chilling breeze I ate my deli wedge on a rock jutting out into the lake under the late afternoon sun. No one else was around. Just a hawk circling on the breeze. 
Giggles caught up. As we chatted a flock of geese swam up to shore, honking to one another and wetting their beaks. Then one boldly walked ashore between Giggles and me, who were only ten feet apart, followed one by one by two dozen more geese. They waddled over to the grassy tenting area, pecked around and gaggled for a few minutes, then turned about face and marched single file between us back into the lake, acting like we weren't even there.
Found the shelter at dusk and a southbounder named Freebird in it. He left Katahdin July 9th and hasn't seen another SOBO since New Hampshire. His 7 and 9 year-old grandkids climbed Katahdin and Mount Washington with him on this hike. They've also done a lot of the Adirondack peaks near his home north of Albany.","Lake Canopus Beach
",Telephone Pioneers Shelter,"Aug 26, Wed",21.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630261,"In the morning I found a third hiker had slipped into the shelter after Freebird and I had fallen asleep. It turned out to be Giggles. She'd gotten booted out of her campsite at Nuclear Lake after dark. Odd that they'd be patrolling it. There's no nearby road, so it can't be that popular. 
I got an unusually early start before 7 for two reasons. I wanted to reach the Kent post office before they closed at 5 to pick up mail, and my weather forecast called for potentially severe storms after 4 so I wanted to ride that out in town. 
I sauntered the three miles down to the Appalachian Trail train station on the Metro North commuter line. It showered along the way, enough to wet the underbrush for the rest of the morning. At the station I met two northbounders: Pringles, who's finishing up the AT after getting off last year for her granddaughter's birth, and Leg, who's sectioning Virginia to Vermont. Leg carries a doll leg on his pack he found in Virginia. Pringles plans to flip up to Maine after Massachusetts.
I veered off down the road to a deli for breakfast then caught up to them. We leapfrogged each other a bit. They caught up with me when I lost the trail trying to get around a humongous downed tree. It must have taken up half an acre. The trail zigged, but most hikers zagged the other way around and it was easy to miss getting back to the trail. Once we found it we left some markers to point the way.
A mile later there was a road detour to avoid a condemned footbridge. I'd heard from Freebird it was easy to cross the stream this time of year so just followed the trail. The bridge itself was in poor shape, with just some 2x4's blocking it off. Looks like it's ready to collapse.
The end of the detour also brought me into Connecticut, my tenth state. Can't say I'm sorry to leave New York. The hiking was rough most of the way. A few miles of pasture walks were a respite from the rocks and ledges, but all the downed trees made the last few miles more troublesome.
Connecticut welcomed me with a walk along the Housatonic River, full of boulders and gushing rapids. I stopped to splash my face and head to cool down. Then headed off trail over the old Bull's covered bridge to a convenience store for lunch. Taking full advantage of the deli run today.
It was already 2 and I was nine miles from the Kent post office. I would really have to book to make it by 5. The elevation profile didn't look bad, but Connecticut had borrowed some nasty boulders and ledges from New York. Still, I was a man on a mission and I tackled the unforgiving terrain, zooming at a 3.5 mph clip over Schaghticoke mountain. There is a big difference between 3 and 3.5 mph. The latter demands constant energy and concentration, and requires high motivation to sustain for more than a few minutes. I kept it up at least four miles until conditions changed.
The wind started to rise and the sky darkened. It couldn't be long before the sky opened up. My phone beeped loudly. A tornado warning flashed - get in a basement for the next 45 minutes! I had nowhere to go of course, except to huddle between some boulders. But I'd rather cover ground until something actually happened. A few times the wind did whip up and I wondered if it would turn into a twister but each time it settled down. My phone beeped again - the warning was extended another 45 minutes, to 4 pm. Then minutes later it sounded again to say it was only until 3:45. By then potential tornadoes were no longer my most imminent problem. The edge of the thunderstorm had hit. Heavy rain and hail pounded me through my poncho. The first hail I've seen on this hike. They were like little bits of glass, and I shielded my eyes, hoping they didn't get any larger. The hail didn't last long, but the buckets of rain turned the trail into a river. The trail was just as rocky, bouldery, and rooty as anything in New York, with lots of pointless ups and downs. And now the rocks and roots were wet and the trail was a river (or pond, where it was flat). I had to slow down to watch my step, especially as I navigated steep rocky descents. The rain seemed never to end, and I sloshed through water constantly.
It finally let up an hour later as I reached the road into Kent. I still, amazingly, had 30 minutes until the post office closed and only 1.3 miles of roadwalking left. I jogged and speed walked and made it with ten minutes to spare. Took care of business, then scouted out a stealth tenting spot behind the empty town hall, backing to a wooded hill. I had no intention of taking the long walk back into the woods until the storms passed. 
At the town's little welcome center for hikers - basically bathrooms and a pay shower - I met Hopper. He's a southbounder who had started northbound from Dalton, Massachusetts and flipped back from Katahdin to head south. He hasn't seen a northbound thruhiker in three days. Which means I'm five or six days behind them. Pretty much what I've figured from reading shelter logs. I may see some Nobos yet in New Hampshire and Maine. 
Enjoyed dinner at an Italian place. It's not that I prefer Italian - I'd love to go to the Korean BBQ or Chinese place in Kent. But the Italian joint has sit-down dining. After hiking almost 25 miles today I'm not getting takeout just to huddle under an eave in the rain. 
By dusk it was raining again. From the radar it might be continuing awhile. I waited until it slowed down then headed behind the town hall and set up my tent, keeping things  relatively dry. While the building was empty, it seemed the maintenance crews were busy with storm damage and frequently drove into the parking lot. Each time I figured someone would see the tent and tell me to get out. Probably silly. On a night like this they have bigger things to worry about than kicking a miserable, wet hiker out into the rain.","Telephone Pioneers Shelter
",Schaghticoke Rd (Kent),"Aug 27, Thu",21.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630262,"Kent was shrouded in mist at dawn. Drops continued to strike the tent from trees above. Condensation coated the inside. I try to avoid pitching in the rain, but of course that's why I have a tent in the first place. Just have to air it in the sun when I have a long break. As I was breaking it down a maintenance truck pulled in. The driver noticed me but went about his business and left soon after. Grabbed breakfast at Gifford's, the only place open, but they happen to make a great lox bagel. I never thought of putting avocado on it. 
Leaving town I found Pringles at the gas station. She had weathered the storm in Bulls Bridge, then at dusk followed a gravel road that bypassed Schaghticoke Mountain and stealth camped on a field at the Kent prep school. She had to pass downed power lines and tornado damage. Hopper last night told me he had watched air swirling over Schaghticoke. Being on top of the mountain I never felt like I was in or near a tornado. Either they missed me or the forest cover protected me.
The trail in Connecticut has two styles: laid back strolls along the Housatonic River, and roller coaster rides over steep ledges and rocky hills. The latter are indistinguishable from New York. I remember the river strolls from my sectioning, not the roller coaster. The climbs and descents are short but often very steep. One descent to the river from St. John's Ledges was trickier than the Arden descent in New York. So now I'm pinning my hopes on Massachusetts giving me a break before I get to the Whites.
Fortunately almost every stretch of roller coaster leads to a village with a store or deli. I got breakfast in Kent, lunch in Cornwall Bridge, and a cold Coke in Falls Village to end the day. This is my kind of hiking.
Met a handful of hikers. No Chill is a SOBO who started July 16th and was being slackpacked by her husband. She got caught in yesterday's storm as well. I passed two more SOBOs, including a sixtyish guy, but didn't get their names. Also a young guy sectioning Connecticut. 
I had planned to stay in Salisbury with Vanessa Breton tomorrow, but called to see if she'd pick me up tonight in Falls. She was very obliging, so for the first time since Waynesboro, Virginia I'll be in the same place two nights in a row. I still plan to hike the few miles into Salisbury in the morning but I'll have most of the day off.
Had a chance to talk with two of my kids this afternoon. It's been awhile, I keep waiting until I have wifi for a video call, but that's been rare so the good ol' fashioned audio will do. 
Vanessa picked me up at the package store in Falls where my ""package"" was a liter-sized Coke. She has hosted hikers in her home for years. In fact I stayed there during a section three years ago. Her home is in the center of Salisbury, an historic and well-kept classic New England town. 
After an amazing shower I walked to the corner to eat at Neo in the cool evening air. I treated myself to a steak, by far the finest meal I've had on this hike. Two older locals were performing a light jazz set. 
The forecast is now for rain all day, particularly heavy in the early morning. So we'll see about hiking those few miles. Once dry it takes some fortitude to go back out in the muck.","Schaghticoke Rd (Kent)
",Water St (Falls Village),"Aug 28, Fri",25
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630280,"The ""wall of rain"" forecast turned out to be only light rain so I rose before dawn for a morning slackpack back to town. Vanessa drove me over to Falls Village where I got breakfast at Toymaker's Cafe. The Anglophile owners also run a British motorcycle parts business out of the brightly-painted cedar shake home. But they are closing the cafe after Labor Day indefinitely. A loss to thruhikers. They have been very generous letting hikers camp in their yard over the years.
The rain gave a subdued feel to the village as I hiked out past the old brick power plant and over the Housatonic River on the Amesville bridge. Thunderous falls above the bridge were partially dammed, and looked like they'd be mighty inviting on a hot day. 
The trail climbed slowly nearly 1000 feet to Mt. Prospect, the biggest single climb since at least New Jersey, maybe Virginia. The rain and mist enveloped the forest, deepening the greens and browns. The drizzle was light enough that I was largely protected by the canopy. The air felt fresh and clean. I was glad I'd decided to hike. A few other brave souls passed - a couple of trail runners, a dog walker, even a backpacker. 
On the far side of the summit the trail opened to a sloping field with a long view known as Rand's View. Clouds curled around the distant hills. Shortly after, my attention was grabbed by an arresting vertical boulder known as Giant's Thumb. It stood like an ancient monolith amid the mist. Though the rock was damp, a better climber than I could no doubt have scrambled to the top. I made a couple of attempts and thought better of it.
The beauty of slackpacking is going back to a dry home or hostel. It doesn't matter if you get wet or dirty, you can enjoy the experience without fretting about setting up camp or waking up to wet everything. I've slackpacked before, in the sense of dayhiking a section, but I've always carried my full pack. Part of my purist style. Today I carried only water, snacks, a poncho, and first aid. Water aside, it weighed about two pounds. I think I understand the attraction now. Looking forward to some more slackpacking opportunities up north. 
After passing the 1500 mile mark with a very official-looking sign (and a bunch of sticks for the current year's location), the AT emptied me onto a road leading to Salisbury. A bike trail, an old railroad right-of-way, let me get off the road and come in through the town's back door. It brought me right to LaBonne's market where I resupplied and refueled on sushi, hummus, and corned beef, and generally enjoyed perusing the high-end food selection. 
The afternoon was pure rest. It's been a couple of weeks since I relaxed for more than an hour during daylight. Hoping this recharges my batteries mentally and physically enough to push on through Massachusetts and Vermont.","Water St (Falls Village)
",Salisbury,"Aug 29, Sat",7.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630302,"Gorgeous day for hiking - sunny, cool, low humidity, breezy. Grabbed a massive ""grinder"" at LaBonne's before leaving Salisbury. Not sure what happened to the New York ""wedge""?
Several actual mountain climbs today, not just up and down the ridge. Plenty of dayhikers at Lion's Head, Bear, Race, and Everett mountains. Scrub pines and bedrock gave them a subalpine feel even at 2300-2600 feet. Steep ledges popped up in some of the descents. Definitely not a walk in the park.
In between was tranquil and mossy Sages Ravine with its rippling creek, relatively remote from the parking lots. So remote I was able to skinny-dip in one of the swimming holes. Brisk! Would have been refreshing on a warmer day.
Passed into Massachusetts leaving the ravine. A SOBO girl named Bubbles happened to hit the border at the same time. Maybe a mile later I crossed paths with more, including Wiz and Chicken John. Also a guy sectioning to NY. Said he was carrying a week of food. You're gonna pass a lot of delis, ya know!
Near the top of Race Mountain were trail volunteers in climbing harnesses who had been cataloguing plants on the cliffs below the ledges. They told me the state had closed the shelters and campsites, but they were ""practicing their civil disobedience"" and advised I used them and their bear boxes rather than stealth camp. They've had some bear activity at a few. 
The trail led along a long open ledge up Race with views to the east. Found a backpacking family with young kids at the summit.
Everett was a tough up and down with plenty of steep ledges to clamber down. And later another sharp descent off Mt. Bushnell where the AT leaves the Taconic range. Then an easy 4 miles through fields and woods to route 7. Passed a monument to Shay's Rebellion, a farmers' revolt against taxes imposed by the Massachusetts government in the years immediately after they had thrown off Parliament's yoke over taxes. The rebellion was quickly dispersed, but the taxes were also repealed.
Despite the beautiful weather and varied hiking I wasn't feeling much drive today. A late start, compounded by frequent stops for swimming and pictures, and a slower pace meant I wouldn't reach the shelter and would need to find a (illegal) stealth spot. So I surrendered to my inner child, the one always demanding cold drinks and pizza, and hitched into Great Barrington to a motel, hoping more rest and calories would improve my outlook.","Salisbury
",US 7 (Great Barrington),"Aug 30, Sun",21.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630328,"I was content to walk the three miles from the Days Inn in Great Barrington back to trail along route 7. There was a bagel place along the way I wanted to try! I did get a lox bagel, but it didn't feel so great paying twice what it cost in Warwick, NY. The Berkshires earn their rep for pricey living. While I walked off the calories along the road, a car stopped to offer a ride. It turned out to be Dottie who, along with her husband Dave, had given me a lift into town yesterday. They live practically next to the trailhead and pick up hikers all the time. Such nice people. I keep a list of such folks so I can send them thank you cards after I finish.
Minutes into the trail I passed a maintainer weed-whacking the grass along the trail. He asked about downed trees or storm damage behind me, but I told him Massachusetts has been pretty clean. Connecticut took a few hits from the last storm but the worst seems to have spared this area.
A couple of nights recently have dropped to around 50 degrees. A timely reminder that I need cold weather gear for New Hampshire and Maine. I called my daughter and wife while I walked this easy stretch to arrange to ship my winter gear to Hanover, New Hampshire. While talking I lost the trail as it doglegged through a road crossing and found myself back on route 7, well to the south. Ah well, just another bonus mile!
I continue to pass a lot of southbound hikers. Hops and Sorry are a couple that started in Georgia and got off at Stecoah Gap before the Smokies. They restarted in NJ, went south to Stecoah, then flipped to Katahdin and went south. They are ten days from finishing in Jersey. This year is making for some complicated hikes. With them was a true SOBO named Mad Dog. Later I met Cinderfella, a skinny kid with long blonde hair who started July 19th, so making great time. There were other hikers I exchanged quick pleasantries with but never got names. I'm seeing so many I can't talk to them all. I'm sure they felt the same way about NOBOs for awhile.
Benedict Pond looked extremely inviting as I passed it, with a perfect clutch of boulders for sunning and contemplating. I took a dip in the cool waters, after waiting for some families to hike through, then finished off my grinder from yesterday as I dried on the boulder.
The terrain has gradually become less rocky, often covered in pine needles, though still rooty. A lovely evening climb took me through yarrow fields blazing gold in the evening sun, and up through pines and ferns over Cobble Hill in Tyringham.
The light was dying. I'd started late from town and put in nearly twenty miles but wasn't going to make it to Upper Goose Pond Shelter without a few hours of night hiking. Stopping, though, would mean a long day to Dalton tomorrow. Better to stop early tonight and start early tomorrow. I need to be more disciplined in the mornings if I'm going to cover the miles I need to.
I came to a stream in a low elevation wooded area outside of the village of Tyringham. The forest floor was relatively flat and covered with pine needles, a great area for stealth camping. So of course there were signs saying No Camping. I generally respect these signs, which are usually posted in overused areas near overlooks. But Massachusetts has a blanket ban on any dispersed camping. And unfortunately the official campsites near here are ten miles apart. Plus the state has officially closed them for the time being anyway. So basically no camping, period, in Massachusetts. Well, I needed to sleep, so I would sort out their Catch-22 another day. This particular stretch was National Park Service land anyway.
More worrying - when I went to filter the stream water I couldn't find my Sawyer filter! I haven't taken water from streams much in the two weeks since I got back on trail in Pennsylvania, relying instead on water caches and businesses, but I know I used it 4 days ago south of Kent. I don't remember seeing it when I exploded my pack at Vanessa's in Salisbury. I suspect it fell out of the front pocket of my pack when I hurriedly grabbed my poncho during the hail and tornado on Schaghticoke. My dirty water bag was attached to it, so now I have just the one Smartwater bottle. 
I'm not one to tempt fate with unfiltered water. There are high springs in the south I will drink from, but dipping into a low-lying stream in agricultural Tyringham isn't my first choice. But I had no choice. I plotted a quick hike to the nearest spigot tomorrow, and hoped the stream was clean enough.","US 7 (Great Barrington)
",Stealth site near Tyringham mile 1543.9,"Aug 31, Mon",20.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630329,"I got a reasonably early start for me, driven by the need to get clean water. There is a motel nine miles out on route 20 that sells sodas to hikers, and probably has a spigot too. That should be enough to get me to Dalton tonight. And tomorrow I will pass a few miles from an outfitter in Cheshire to get a new filter.
A stream of SOBOs passed me halfway to the Upper Goose Pond shelter. Books, an orange-haired guy with glasses; Swat, a fit white-haired guy who started in Georgia May 4th then flipped at Duncannon, and many more. Also met Armadillo, who I had been following on Instagram (as Mediocre Mountaineer) for over a month since he burst out of the 100 Mile Wilderness in four days. He's relaxed a bit since, but was now sprinting to meet his mom in Great Barrington. A Connecticut native, he plans to hike all 52 miles of his home state in one day.
After rounding Upper Goose Pond I crossed the Mass Pike (Interstate 90) and at route 20 walked a short way to the Berkshire Lakeside Lodge. The owner let me fill up my bottle with clean water, sold me a few sodas, and gave me a delicious chocolate muffin. He goes on my trail angel list of people to thank later. This should be enough liquid to get me 19 more miles to Dalton.
Back in the woods, an Army helicopter buzzed me at close range a couple of times, then hovered over a beaver pond like it was practicing maneuvers. Incredibly loud. Wonder if there's a base nearby.
At October Mountain Shelter I crossed paths once again with the man who had been studying plants on the cliffs of Race Mountain two days ago. He was maintaining wildlife cameras near the shelter. There are bobcats, coyotes, bear, porcupines and fishers in these woods. But what really surprised me are the moose. I didn't know they ranged this far south. He showed me a tree where a moose had bitten and ripped off strips of bark last year. Apparently they are so tough they eat tree bark!  In any case I've been dying to see a moose for some time. Two trips through Maine and no sightings. Now I'll be scanning every pond and bog from here to Katahdin for one of these noble creatures.
The guy leads wildlife and ecology studies for the Berkshire chapter of the AMC. One thing he's noticed is a sharp drop-off in animal prints in an area near the AT between April and October. Should be prime activity months, but it's also prime hiking season. The animals seem to be avoiding hikers. Most of his wildlife footage also is triggered at night. Deer seem to be the only large mammals easily seen during the day. Well, at least it's not just me wondering where all the animals are!
Though a couple of miles later I did see a quail. It was only mildly perturbed by my presence and stayed close to the trail.
Six miles from Dalton on Warned Hill I popped my last soda. I was committed now. I needed to reach town for water. I was making excellent time. Better than any day in a long time. I'd end up hiking 28 miles, the most since Shenandoah.
On the way down I met another redhead named Skymall, a SOBO from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Said he'd seen some NOBOs on the other side of Greylock. They'd be the first I'd seen in many weeks. He fell behind his southbound bubble of friends when his girlfriend came up to hike the Presidentials with him. But he likes having shelters to himself just as much.
In Dalton I stopped at the home of Tom Levardi. Tom's been letting hikers tent in his yard for 41 years. At all times of year. He's had winter hikers come through. One girl refused to come inside because once warm she wouldn't want to go back out!  
Hanging out was a SOBO named Ratio, who looked like a young Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya. He took off to night hike a few more miles. Another hiker named Knoxville was headed south to Harpers Ferry, where he will then jump to some point in the south to head down to Springer. He'd done the middle section northbound starting in May as ""Forty"". He looked familiar but I couldn't place him.
Finally there was a kid just turned 18 from Lebanon, Pennsylvania. His father had kicked him out before he'd finished high school. He started hiking the AT, then got off and bought a bike, trying to follow the AT closely by back roads. His bike broke down in southern Massachusetts and he hiked up to Dalton. Tom's been letting him stay for two months, and now he helps out with the hikers. Tom has had long term guests before. Once a couple of teenagers from the Bronx made it up here and tented for months. If their mom hadn't come to get them he thinks they'd still be here.
Tom warned us before we went to our tents that a skunk often wanders into the yard. I've already seen what looks like a cat pass the tent several times.","Stealth site near Tyringham mile 1543.9

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630381,"Forgot to mention yesterday that Tom and neighbor Bible Bill (AT '99) fed us pasta, salad and more last night. I walked in at just the right time to make sure there were no leftovers.
FB, the kid from Lebanon, had coffee and donuts out on the porch by the time we got our tents down. It was already raining lightly. Forecasted to rain all day. And I'm aiming to get over Mount Greylock, the highest peak since Shenandoah, to Williamstown. Over 23 miles with some steep trail I'm told. Plus I need to find time to get to the outfitters for a water filter and bag.
FB found a Sawyer Mini filter in the hiker box, so in a pinch I can screw that on my bottle. It's not as durable or fast as the regular Sawyer, but it's an emergency patch. And I still need a water bag for longer water carries. 
It rained steadily but lightly as I hiked a long residential streets out of town and climbed up a ridge that would take me to Cheshire about ten miles away. A SOBO girl named Smiles passed. She wasn't smiling when I first saw her but seemed happy to meet someone.
Lots of red efts (salamanders) on trail. I had to watch my step. A clump of four at one point scattered as I approached. They must like the rain.
The trail led me down through the village of Cheshire, apparently known at one point for making giant wheels of cheese, and over to route 8 where a convenience store with a Dunkin Donuts provided a quick lunch. 
I called Bershire Outfitters up the road for a ride. It's three miles off trail and was still raining. Busy signal. Tried again. And again. For almost an hour I got nothing. Odd, I called yesterday to verify they had a filter and would pick me up. Were they closed? Power down? I didn't want to hitch up there (in the rain) to find them closed. I considered calling Tom for a ride. Finally I got through and was picked up and got my filter and returned to trail quickly. The outfitter was heavy on kayaks and bikes but had a workable selection of hiking gear. 
While waiting at the convenience store I met a man hiking Massachusetts with his teenage daughter. She, like my daughter, is in Scouts BSA (aka Boy Scouts) and just earned First Class. They left before my ride came. As I started up the trail later they were coming back down to the road. The father had hurt his knee. And they were only a day from finishing. They plan to rest up at a motel and see how he feels tomorrow. I wish them well. 
The fourteen mile climb over Greylock went by pretty bogs and ponds, over lots of bog boards, and some rocks. The ascent was stretched out. The summit, which one can drive to and is often crowded, was foggy, rainy, very windy, and deserted. Bascom Lodge was empty but for a desk clerk. Lunch service had ended. Nothing for me here except a quote by Thoreau engraved on a stone: 
""It were as well to be educated in the shadow of a mountain as in more classic shade. Some will remember no doubt, not only that they went to college but that they went to the mountain.""
The descent was fairly steep in places. Wet surfaces and encroaching darkness made it trickier. I finally had to break out the headlamp a mile or two from town. Hit the road at 8pm, well past sunset.
My brother and niece are vacationing in New England and stopped in Williamstown on their way to Vermont. They picked me up and took me to my motel. Tomorrow, when I'm clean and refreshed, we'll meet for breakfast before both heading into Vermont on separate paths.","Dalton
",Route 2 (Williamstown),"Sep 02, Wed",23.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630425,"My brother Chris and his daughter Grace are vacationing in New England and fortuitously were passing through Williamstown on their way to Vermont. They stopped for the night, gave me a ride to my motel and, after I got my chores done yesterday (including handwashing my disgusting socks and shirt in the sink), we caught up over breakfast at a local diner. It was heartwarming to see familiar faces so far from home. I've now seen my brother, sister, daughter, three sons, a nephew and a niece on trail. I'm very blessed they all took time to visit and, in my kids' case, hike with me.
Chris and Grace drove me back to the supermarket near the trail on route 2 where I did a light resupply to get me to Manchester. I didn't get back on trail until noon, so I decided to see how far I'd get and not push for a specific goal. But I still needed to lay down some miles. Katahdin will probably close in less than six weeks. And even more imminent, the Kennebec ferry stops running September 30th.
The Kennebec is the widest unbridged river on the AT. Maine has many rivers (often called ""streams"" or ""brooks"") that must be forded, but the Kennebec is far wider and deeper. Because there are unscheduled releases from the dam upriver that can raise the water level two feet within minutes, and the ford is already waist-deep, it's recommended that hikers not ford it. Although many have done so successfully, years ago a hiker died trying and the ATC began contracting a canoe ferryman to take hikers across one or two at a time. The canoe has a white blaze on it, indicating it's the official route, and the ATC warns against fording every chance it gets. The ferry only runs a few hours a day. If you miss it, you need to camp and wait until the next day. It stops entirely at the end of September. Last year and in years before, the ferry ran into mid-October because it's only 150 miles from Katahdin and some hikers are still on trail. Not this year. I contacted the ferryman, who not only didn't know why the ATC opted to end it early but didn't even offer an alternative after the 30th. The AT center in Monson also had no answer. So apparently this year it's not all that important to the ATC that hikers safely cross the Kennebec. 
There are supposedly private ferries. But I really don't need the drama, expense, or worry of arranging one. Nor do I particularly want to roll the dice on fording. Easiest just to get there before month end. All that just to say I couldn't simply hike a few miles today and call it a day. I have a deadline. And any slack time I want to save for the Whites.
Had some rock scrambling to reach the first ridgeline. Since there will be plenty of this in New Hampshire and Maine I took a few minutes to figure out a way to securely stow my trekking poles out of the way of my arms and legs. The yellow bungees that have been uselessly dangling from my ULA pack since Damascus finally came in handy. I'm now ready for the Whites. Bring 'em on!
The AT in Vermont is coextant with the Long Trail for the first hundred miles. The Long Trail is even older than the AT, having begun in 1909 and been the model for trail artifacts like shelters and blazes. In fact both trails are blazed white. Many people thruhike the Long Trail, which runs 272 miles from Massachusetts to Canada over the Green Mountains, and September is the prime season due to fewer bugs and less mud. Vermont is often called Vermud thanks to the truly awful conditions that persist from spring thaw well into summer. When I LASHed this section three years ago in early July after a storm, the mud was so bad I practically had a mental breakdown trying to keep my feet dry, stumbling into Bennington an emotional wreck. The trail was nearly one long mud puddle, wider than the trail in many places. I learned an important lesson then about not fighting the inevitable - namely wet feet - if you want to keep your sanity. It was probably my worst day ever on trail, and that's including some incredibly nasty storms and a brush with hypothermia.
The mud today, however, was barely noticeable. Most mud patches were squishy but not standing water. My foot might sink in a couple inches at worst but it wouldn't soak my socks. The patches were usually avoidable by stepping on stones, roots, or branches thrown over the mud, but they often weren't worth contorting to avoid. In fact Vermont is possibly the most pleasant hiking since southern Pennsylvania.
Before I even reached the Vermont border I met two girls who were attempting to thruhike the Long Trail (LT). One of them asked if I was dayhiking. I guess my small pack, recent shower, and trimmed hair and beard give that impression to the uninitiated. I imagine many dayhikers and maybe a few inattentive long-distance hikers think the same. I've been told more than once I'm too clean to be a thruhiker. Maybe that's a compliment, but it doesn't feel that way! My gear, beat-up Smartwater bottle, tattered shoes, worn shirt, quick pace, gaunt face, and steely gaze of chipped granite (I wish) are dead giveaways to those who know what to look for, not to mention the odor that resurfaces after mere minutes of sweating.   
Ran across more LT-ers as I climbed through beautiful spruce and pine forests, past ferns and beaver ponds. A kid sitting in the trail looking exhausted a mile or two past the border. Wants to lighten his pack by ditching heavy food. Another pausing at a pond, a Boston-accented guy named Chris pushing to meet friends at Stratton in a couple of day - an ambitious schedule for just starting. Most take 3-4 weeks to hike the LT, and most go north, though I did meet a SOBO at the Williamstown Stop 'n Shop just finishing his hike.
All had heavy, often enormous packs. Fresh faces, giddy about the hike and nervous they are doing everything wrong. Full of questions, which I was happy to answer if I could. It all reminds me of Georgia when I started a LASH there last March.
Suddenly the perfect cool, sunny day became overcast. A very light sprinkle began. But rather than strengthen, it soon disappeared and the sun returned for the remainder of the day.
In late afternoon at Congdon Shelter a young AT SOBO named Bunion looked like he was done for the day. He acted listless, not much for conversation, limply eating peanut butter. Tried to get him to open up, but it just wasn't his day. Maybe tomorrow will be better.
I still had daylight and headed for the next shelter six miles away. As the sun began setting I dropped steeply to cross route 9 and climbed up switchbacks to the shelter, passing through a split boulder the size of a van. 
Five Long Trail hikers were already cozy in the shelter. Brian from Burlington, Chloe and her boyfriend, and two other girls. The shelter was set up with three double-wide bunk beds, and one upper was still free. It was already hiker midnight so I kept conversation to a minimum, ate, hung my bag, and went to sleep.","Route 2 (Williamstown)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630426,"I felt pretty lazy this morning. I was up at my usual time and hiking by 8:30 but all the eager new Long Trailers left much earlier. I caught up with three of them at a shelter having lunch. One girl with a blue ponytail has been christened Smurf. She was fretting about food. She has a peanut sensitivity and wants light food she doesn't need to cook. I couldn't give her much advice. My own trail diet is granola bars, jerky, ham and cheese, and occasional fruit.
Glastonbury Mountain was covered in pines, but an open firetower afforded spectacular full-circle views of the Adirondacks, Green Mountains and probably Greylock and New Hampshire. The wind whipped up dramatically as I climbed the steps above the trees. Such a chill! Much more of this to come in the alpine areas ahead.
Two Williams College juniors were hanging out at the next shelter, hiking back to school for classes starting Tuesday. The girl, a theater major, is taking the semester off to avoid the partially virtual classes. Resting with them was a middle-aged woman hiking the Long Trail, full of conversation and trail advice.
I booked it 10.5 miles up and over Stratton Mountain to the next shelter so I could make tomorrow a short day into Manchester. In the Stratton firetower were a couple hiking the Long Trail making dinner. The guy, Brian, works at a river outfitter on the Kennebec in the Forks near the AT crossing in Caratunk. Told me to look him up if I need anything, like missing the ferry maybe?
I flew down the mountain as the sun was setting. Over three miles in fifty minutes. It was a surprisingly easy descent. Stratton Pond Shelter was bustling. It's a very large cabin that sleeps sixteen. There are eight other hikers, all doing the Long Trail, plus a couple of tenters. Since I rolled in near 8 and it was nearly dark I again unpacked and ate quietly. Second night in a row I'm pushing hiker midnight. A hiker had left out his glass Jim Beam bourbon bottle with a Sawyer filter screwed on the top.","Melville Nauheim Shelter
",Stratton Pond Shelter,"Sep 04, Fri",27.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630436,"Woke up to a temperature in the mid-40s, but I was still fairly cozy under my summer bag and silk liner. I fan out the bag like a quilt, putting my feet in the footbox. This provides more coverage so I can roll around. If half the sleeping bag is under you it provides no insulation anyway because it has no loft. My sleeping pad insulates me underneath. Soon I'll swap out the 45-degree bag for my 20-degree quilt.
Today I planned to take a Nero into Manchester Center to relax all afternoon. Just 11 miles to Vermont route 11. I arranged with Charlie G, a local trail angel whose name is all over shelters and Guthooks comments from here to the sign on Katahdin, for a noon pickup. Three LT Nobos at the shelter were also looking for a ride into town. 
Coming out of the shelter I passed beautiful Stratton Pond. The water was sparkling and so inviting I wanted to jump in. But it was far too cold! I'm afraid my swimming days are numbered up north thanks to the late season.
Brian and Willy, two of the LTers looking for a ride, are two young guys from Louisiana currently living in a cabin near Mt Washington owned by Willy's family where they are fixing it up. They've done a lot of hiking in the Whites recently and surprised me by mostly keeping up with my pace all morning. The trail rolled over the ridge with little vertical change and brought us to a view of Manchester and Equinox Mountain at Prospect Rock where dayhikers were already appearing. Little mud and comparatively few rocks made for a pleasant walk in the woods
The trailhead lot was packed on this gorgeous Saturday with cars mostly from out of state - New York, Massachusetts, and even Pennsylvania and Virginia. Charlie found us in the tumult of dayhikers and vehicles. As he drove us into town he said he's helped 1700 hikers in the past four months. Many of them stay on his property. He can no longer hike himself, and has trouble just walking around. Says most people in his condition would be in a wheelchair and taking heavy drugs by now but he refuses. He's friendly in a gruff way, and his booming voice sounds just like John Goodman on the old Roseanne show.
Charlie dropped Brian, Willy, and me in town. The others were going back to trail today, while I wanted to grab lunch and resupply. I had a burrito at a place called Cilantro, but it turned out to be much too small. A sundae from the must-stop Ben & Jerry's store didn't fill me either. So I got a Big Mac at McDonald's, first time I've eaten at one on this hike. It was underwhelming, but did the job for now. 
Manchester Center is a mix of year-round services for rural Vermont, like the McDonalds and the Price Chopper with the pathetic produce section, and high-end retailers for the out-of-state crowds that flock here in the fall for leaves and winter for skiing. Passing Armani as I walked the hundred yards from McDonalds to the outfitter was odd. At the outfitter I replaced a couple of tent stakes I had accidentally bent by hammering into rocks, and Charlie picked me up outside.
Charlie's modest property on route 7 backs to the national forest. I joined two other hikers in a pop-up trailer in the yard that serves as a bunkroom. A 29-year-old girl from Savannah doing the AT called Reeses (Pieces) has been here for a week recovering from injury. She started north from Pawling, NY intending to thruhike. She may have Charlie shuttle her to Katahdin soon and head south. She wishes she could have brought her dog, but all the traveling plus restrictions in Baxter and the Smokies made her decide against it.
Journey Man (AT '16), the other guest, is a 69-year-old retiree from Asheville and lifelong wood carver hiking the Long Trail north. His appearance and demeanor remind you of an older Bob Ross - full white beard and afro, glint in his eyes, and the same soft, calm, cheerful, unassuming voice and personality. His walking stick is a work of art with a shepherd, turtle, rattlesnake, and turquoise stones encircling it in high relief. The shepherd carrying a sheep represents love, the snake healing, and the turtle steadiness - the three keys to his hike. He's made one for every hike and countless others for grandchildren and friends. He dreamed of the AT for so long he carved the walking stick for it 30 years before he hiked. A Vietnam vet who served as an Army medic evacuating the wounded, he recently returned to Vietnam as part of a Habitat for Humanity crew to build a home for a local family and found the people very friendly. He wanted to change his relationship with the country, he said, to put some of the war behind him.
Charlie's daughter Becca, who helps out with hikers, also raises quail. After she and Charlie served us a sausage dinner, she showed us the chicks being raised inside. There are four day old chicks that look like fuzzballs and four week olds as big as pigeons. The grown hens outside produce eggs she sells. Rats have recently been getting into the pen and killing several hens so she's laid a network of traps. Becca also wants to hike the Long Trail, and Reeses has been helping her get prepped and in shape with practice hikes.
Another hiker called in after dinner so we waited up, playing games with Charlie's grown son Dylan, but the hiker was all the way up near Killington so it was nearly 11 before she arrived and we could sleep.","Stratton Pond Shelter
",Route 11 (Manchester Center),"Sep 05, Sat",10.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630458,"A fourth hiker joined us in the pop-up trailer late last night after getting picked up near Killington. Roo is just out of high school thruhiking southbound. She apparently came out with dozens of other grads and started in early July. But her close-knit tramily have since all left the trail, and she's well behind the others in her larger group. So she's debating whether to skip ahead to hike with them or find other SOBOs closer to her.
Charlie made a fantastic bacon and French toast breakfast, with Vermont maple syrup of course. It has to be northern Vermont syrup, according to Charlie. Due to the climate it's sweeter. He should know. He lugged 5 gallon pails and tended the boiling sap for hours at a time on his grandfather's farm when he was a boy.
Driving back to trail Charlie pointed out Mount Equinox, which has a road to the summit and a restaurant. Charlie was a fire volunteer and drove the firetruck up Mount Equinox once responding to a grease fire. It's so steep that when he drove down the brakes were overworked and he could barely control the truck. Never again, he said!
I hiked up to Mt. Bromley, a nice climb that emerges onto a grassy ski way that gently deposits you on the open grassy summit with a chair lift and ski patrol hut. Long Trail hikers Bowline and Chloe from my first night in Vermont caught up to me. They are moving fast for this early in their thruhike and are a day ahead of schedule. Hope they don't overdue it. The ski patrol warming hut is open for hikers to sleep in. Would have been an interesting stop, but I can't stay everywhere! Long views, including Killington in the distance. Said goodbye to Journey Man, who had set out with me this morning. A fascinating, kind man. Probably the first hiker I felt a real connection with in a very long time. Sorry that we are on different trails this year.
I sauntered (in the John Muir sense) over Peru and Styles peaks, through two wilderness areas, and past two lovely lakes - Griffith Lake and Little Rock Pond. Little Rock's shelter was bustling and lots of campers were enjoying the lake. I was tempted to stop, but had planned to go another five miles to the next shelter so I could get over Killington tomorrow. And I told myself I didn't really fit in with this crowd. The previous shelter at Big Branch was also an inviting location, perched over a roaring brook. If only I had all the time in the world.
The trail climbed over an unnamed mountain and the terrain moved into pine and spruce forest with needle-covered trail and jagged white rocks. In two areas littered with small rocks hikers had created rock gardens full of fanciful cairns.
I reached Greenwall Shelter around 7 with some daylight left. It was well off trail and empty. The water source was dry. It had been a long day, hiking almost constantly, and this felt like a very lonely end to the day. I suddenly and acutely missed my family and became overwhelmed by the long day, indeed all the long days and the ones to come, to the point of tears. There haven't been many times I just wanted to go home and give up the hike. This was one of them. Tomorrow will be better, I told myself. You're tired. Get some sleep. 
The air was perfectly calm and still. I could hear the distant rustling of small animals in the leaves. Leaves are already falling from some trees. Occasional fireworks or gun shots sounded in the distance. Labor Day is tomorrow.","Route 11 (Manchester Center)
",Greenwall Shelter,"Sep 06, Sun",24.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630459,"Happy Labor Day! Felt better with a solid night's rest. The air is now cool enough in the morning I'm reluctant to get out from under my sleeping bag. I finally hit the trail about 8:30. I really need to start earlier. I'm burning daylight, and there's less of it each day. Every minute I spend in camp is one less minute I can rest during the day.
Passed a few SOBOs in the morning. A couple of them barely acknowledged me. One with earbuds, who I stepped aside for and greeted, hiked by without a word, without even turning his head. Don't be that guy! But one was very talkative, downright excited. He was Lando, a very young kid who only started August 3rd. He's on a deadline to finish and is happy to be in easier terrain and able to do bigger miles.
The trail dipped sharply into Clarendon Gorge where it passes over a narrow suspension footbridge. But I noticed directly below was the clearest, most pristine, boulder-lined swimming hole I've yet seen. So I scrambled ten yards down the steep bank and jumped in. It was cool, but so refreshing after eight miles of breaking a sweat. After drying off I hopped the boulders to the other side and clambored up the far bank. This is the kind of spur-of-the-moment diversion I want to have time for during the shortening days.
I pounded out a few more miles over no notable climbs, until I happened on a small wooden sign on a tree: ""Katahdin - 500 miles"". That's it, less than a quarter to go. It's gone by so fast, and yet I feel the weight of the miles - emotionally if not so much physically. It's exciting to know that I will see far more thruhikers in the last 500 miles than the all the trail behind me.
And speaking of which, I stumbled on a clutch of SOBOs getting water in the valley below. NatGeo from Harrisburg, who takes lots of wildlife video. He's seen 5 moose. I've seen zero! So jealous. Two others, The Hard Way and a Pittsburgh guy wearing a kilt named Whole Foods just bumped into each other for the first time since their first days in the 100 Mile Wilderness.
I met many Long Trail hikers as well. An older brother and sister - the sister working on completing the trail in sections and the brother, having done it twice, out to support her. A mother and grown daughter. A young guy bearing two homemade walking staffs. And many others.
As I climbed Killington, the first really substantial climb at over 2500 feet since Three Ridges back in Virginia, I crossed paths with Roo. So glad to see her back on trail. She asked about Whole Foods and the others, who fortuitously had told me they were all headed to a shelter just eight miles back. She'll be able to reach them tonight and have some company again.
Killington did a good job of whooping my butt. But it's baby steps compared to the Whites. I've got my work cut out for me. Where the trail crests there's a blue-blazed side trail to the actual summit, some 300 feet higher over a sadistically steep vein of rocks. Actually it wasn't that bad but it did test my lung capacity. The wind was gusting at the summit and it felt significantly cooler. Enough to remind me of the fickle weather ahead of me in the alpine regions. I went over the summit to the ski resort lodge and gondola lift, but both were closed for the day. They only operate on weekends, and serve mountain bikers wishing to ride down the trails. 
A number of hikers were setting up for the night at Cooper Lodge at the foot of the summit side trail, but I wanted to put down more miles and, hopefully, get a good meal and lodging tonight at the Inn at Long Trail. Killington was much rockier than Stratton and the descent was slower. A Long Trail hiker I passed told me the Inn was booked for the night. Well, second choice was to hitch into Rutland for food and a soft bed. It was late in the day, though. I hustled but didn't reach the road until after 7:30. It was already dusk. No cars stopped as my light waned. Finally it was too dark to expect anyone to stop. I was over 7 miles from town. Mentally committed to my plan, I tried Uber but no driver could be found. I called a taxi service but they didn't pick up. I called a trail angel but he was working and couldn't come. But he gave me another name - Flipakey. 
Flipakey answered immediately and not only picked me up but put me up in her home for the night. She does this frequently, especially since the one hostel in town, the Yellow Deli, is closed. She drove me around to get dinner (Five Guys, yum!) and resupply. Ironically, after I had called her a girl drove into the small condo parking lot I'd chosen to wait in and turned out to be an avid hiker. She would have given me a ride if I'd needed it. In fact she planned her own thruhike next year and was curious about my pack and tent. We chatted until Flipakey arrived.
So another long day ending at dusk, but not at an empty shelter. I have a feeling (a hope?) I won't be seeing too many of those anymore.","Greenwall Shelter
",Route 4 (Rutland),"Sep 07, Mon",25.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630495,"Restful night at Flipakey's. She is a very young-looking grandmother two or three times over. Shares the house with a tenant. Her trail name Flipakey was a childhood imaginary creature she created that was part unicorn and part fawn with rabbit feet. 
Rutland is best known in the AT community as the home of the Yellow Deli hostel, run by the Twelve Tribes church. Most hikers refer to them as a cult and circulate strange stories. I have no first-hand knowledge. Their hostel is closed this year. But Flipakey spent a year with them in the late 90s. She says they are not a cult, just a group recreating the early church intentional community described in the New Testament. A devout Catholic and lifelong Rutland resident, her perspective seems to deserve more weight than that of hikers who spent a night or ate a sandwich there. We even stopped at the Yellow Deli last night on the way back from the trail so she could pick up a dinner order.
Clever Man joined me as I started out at Rt 4. He had stayed at the Inn at Long Trail (which was in fact full). We walked the two miles together to Maine Junction where the Long Trail and AT split, and here we parted ways. His dad regularly section-hiked the AT and he joined him several times. He's now middle-aged himself. The LT is his first thruhike.
Met more LT-ers coming from the Inn via the AT. One was Bumblebee, a woman who thruhiked the AT in 2018.
Then, walking through the Gifford State Park campground, I encountered another NOBO! I haven't seen a true NOBO who started in Georgia since Virginia. Yard Sale started in May and knew some of the hikers I met in Virginia. I left him to take a side trail to Base Camp Outfitter. There I found a foursome of NOBOs. When it rains it pours!  These guys were all college-aged: Irish, Felix (German), Big Dog(?) and Stitch. I walked over to the deli and when I returned they were playing disc golf on the course behind the outfitter. I returned to the AT and circled Kent Pond. A dock stood where it crossed the lawn of the Mountain Meadow Lodge. Kayaks sat there and I could see a kayaker out fishing. The day was beautiful so I went up to two guys eating lunch outside the lodge, which they were renovating. I asked about renting a kayak and one told me just to take one owned by the lodge. So I tooled around Kent Pond for an hour, beaching in a little cove for a swim along the way. The sun was out, a light breeze blew, a perfect afternoon to be on the water.
Back on trail two SOBOs passed, including a girl named Bigfoot, looking for the deli. I was an expert at that and gave detailed directions.
I nearly hiked past Thundering Falls. Actually I did, then thought better of it. I can't be that blase, why am I out here otherwise? The falls weren't exactly thundering due to low flow, but I did get a nice picture of a red mill by the water.
Soon I met another NOBO, a flip-flopper who started in Harpers Ferry. Metalbath is a one-handed metal worker who was recently laid off and decided to hike. He exclaimed enthusiastically how he stops often because still loves to take pictures of everything. Talk about not being blase. 
Ran across southbounders Bonanza and his brother Rocky, who flipped to Katahdin from Glasgow. They knew Thor, Water Queen, Strider and Roam, Sunshine and Lone Wolf. In fact I probably met them down south. Rocky remembers hearing about me hiking with my son in Georgia. In fact he started the same day we left Springer Shelter.
I only hiked seventeen miles, though it was tiring over numerous hills in the heat and humidity, because I wanted to stay at the Lookout, a private cabin open to hikers. Had to carry in water three miles. It sits on a high ridge and has a roof deck with amazing views. The night sky was perfectly clear, the Milky Way visible for the first time in over a thousand miles. Stitch built a fire to cook his noodles. His three buddies rolled in after dark and set up on the porch of the enclosed cabin. 
Inside were three flip-floppers heading southbound to Harpers Ferry - Diane, Pepper, and Risotto. Risotto was tired of Vermont already - the rolling hills and pastures remind him of Virginia, but not in a good way. Seems like he had a bad day (week? month?). They and the NOBOs have blue ATC tags on their packs, with a number as low as 569, which would be from early March. The ATC stopped issuing tags around March 18th.","Route 4 (Rutland)
",The Lookout,"Sep 08, Tue",17.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630568,"I didn't wake up planning to hike my first thirty mile day, or to jump off a bridge. But life happened.
It started early. I woke before dawn thanks to others stirring. Stitch was still asleep on the roof deck when I climbed up. Felix the German joined us just as the sun peered over the mountains. He kicked Stitch, who mumbled and tried to go back to sleep. ""Just turn your head a bit,"" we urged. He did. ""That's the most amazing sunrise I've seen this hike,"" murmured Stitch. ""Actually, that's the most amazing sunrise I've ever seen."" 
Irish and Felix had cowboyed on the porch. They were talking until 10 or so last night and up early talking around 5:30. I had earplugs, but Risotto seemed pretty upset this morning with the disturbance. Of course he also doesn't like Vermont because it's like Virginia. And when I mentioned he would see Thundering Falls today, ready to make a joke about the lack of thundering, he stole my thunder with ""Each of these falls seems lamer than the last. If it's not Niagara I don't care anymore."" And then promptly dismissed summiting Killington since he got his full of 4000-footers in the Whites. I don't know why he's still out here. He seems a tad high-strung and unhappy. I doubt the middle states are going to change that.
Big Dog carries a kid's compound bow and arrows. He's not sure why. All four northbounders have huge packs and a week's food - they like their comfort. Big Dog snuck up to the roof to wake up Stitch again by bouncing an arrow off his bag.
I headed out and inauspiciously missed a turn early on and went a half mile downhill to a gravel parking area. Bonus mile! Anyone who says you can't get lost on the AT because there are 80,000 blazes has obviously never hiked the trail. It's a dense forest criss-crossed by old trails and tracks - of course it's easy to get lost. Why do you think they blazed it so much in the first place? It takes so many unexpected turns, crosses creeks where water trails give false leads, veers off dirt roads with limited signage, runs over rocks with no obvious path, and often has infrequent, faded, or poorly placed blazes. If you're not looking for a turn and are in any way distracted - talking, looking at a map, watching the rocks - you can easily miss it. Yes, the PCT has far fewer markers. But it also has far fewer trees. You can often see the next several miles of trail carved into the mountain ahead of you. 
Often I passed old fieldstone walls. Some were just long piles of rocks, others nicely stacked. I thought about the settlers and farmers that built them. Once, these mountains were largely deforested and covered with marginal farms before the occupants left in search of more fertile land in the Midwest. What a difficult life it must have been, digging out a field of rocks just to be able to plant. If they could do that, we can surely dig all the rocks out of the AT!
The AWOL guide promised farm stores near two of the road crossings in the first twelve miles. Both were closed, according to notes at the trailheads. Bummer! So hot today, so humid, so many climbs. I really wanted a cold drink. Over 7000 feet up, 9000 feet down, almost all steep, despite nearly all of it being below 2000 foot elevation. Nothing to do but press on. 
At a stream by one road a couple named Cobra and Mountain Cat were eating lunch. They thrued northbound a couple of years ago and love everything about the AT, so they're doing it southbound now. 
At another stream a hiker getting water pointed me to where the trail continued. I nearly took an unmarked side trail. See what I mean?
Most of the day was rollercoasting over low but steep hills, nearly all PUDs (pointless ups and downs with no views). At one of the few (and partially obscured) views I found section hiker Dell resting in the shade. He's LASHing to Grafton Notch just over the Maine border and was in no hurry. Why did I always feel so rushed when I sectioned?
Yard Sale reappeared and spent several hours leapfrogging with me. He still needs to finish Virginia once he reaches Katahdin. He's an unflappable kind of guy. Little seems to stir him up.
Twenty miles in I crossed the White River on an auto bridge into the tiny village of West Hartford. Comments in Guthooks say hikers often jump off the bridge. Like the James River footbridge in Virginia, but without the hefty fines. I considered it, but as I crossed I looked over the side - a long three stories down - at the exposed bedrock banks and decided it seemed a bit shallow this time of year. ""Nope. Nope, nope, nope. Not gonna happen,"" I thought.
Then I met Randy.
Randy owns the house across from the bridge. He's got a big AT symbol over his blue barn. He and his wife have been giving hikers cold drinks and coffee, and often putting them up in their barn, for many years. When I arrived a 55-year-old Bostonite sectioning Vermont named Copter and a 24-year-old southbounder were hanging out. The younger guy turned out to be from my home county, a few miles from my town. He took the name Wawa after our locally dominant convenience store chain, and was in Coatesville boy scout troop 117.
I asked if people really jump off the bridge. Randy said ""Sure. I've been doing it for thirty years."" Wawa piped in ""I just jumped an hour ago."" Randy has marked where to stand on the bridge to do it safely. He shows hikers all the time. So he led me over. I'm thinking he's going to point it out and let me sweat. But he just stepped over the railing and jumped right in. Wawa followed him as soon as Randy swam out of the way. Well, now or never I thought, setting my jaw as I swung over the railing. Don't think about it, you'll never do it. It's fine, you just watched them do it. Just let go. 
I had a fear of heights when I was younger. Later I realized it wasn't a fear of heights, but a fear of falling. I like the joke, but it's basically true. Recently someone went a step further and said it was really a fear of landing hard. Well, that's also true. But the fear of falling is real. Just thinking about skydiving makes me physically ill. And there I was, willing myself to step into the void. I knew it was safe. I knew I would land in deep water with people nearby if needed. But letting gravity take over completely...well, I've never done that beyond a few feet. 
All this swam through my head in a couple seconds. Get out of your comfort zone, I told myself. The only thing holding you back is you. This isn't about risk, it's about fear of the unfamiliar. You've never done it, so it's scary. Do it once, and the spell is broken. But you have to take the first step yourself. 
So in telling myself to do it quickly it wasn't because logic and reason were about to take over and prevent it. Quite the opposite. If I delayed, I knew my fear would take over. Panic would take hold and overwhelm reason and facts. Logic had brought me here. It'd been proven safe beyond any doubt. I had made a rational, conscious decision to try this new experience, like getting on a rollercoaster. But my lizard brain wanted to back out and flee at any cost. It was out of my comfort zone. Way out, in fact. But that didn't mean it was dangerous or wrong. Those were rationalizations for my fear. 
I do not consider myself particularly brave, but neither do I want to be hostage to my own perception of my limitations. I didn't start a months-long journey because it was comfortable, because it was familiar. I did it to get out of my own skin, to expand my conception of the possible. 
And before I could change my mind, I was falling. 
Time didn't slow down. It took 1.2 seconds to hit the water and it felt like that. My limbs flew wildly about, never having known freefall for so long. I hadn't even thought to take a breath. I hit the water as if it were just denser air, and was several feet under before instinct sent me upwards. I didn't even notice the temperature of the water.
I had to thank Randy for giving me the opportunity, and the example to follow. My rational side otherwise would have had no evidence to fight my phobia.
I still have a fear of landing hard. But I hope my fear of falling took a big hit today.
Randy offered to put me up in his barn, but I thanked him and booked out of West Hartford to get to Hanover. I saw an opportunity to have a full zero tomorrow. I'd made good time all day thanks to the farm stores being closed and having no views. The bridge jump had burned an hour, but it was more than worth it. Fortunately the ten miles to Hanover were easy, if hilly. The last three miles were all on the road. And that's how my thirty mile day just happened.
Around 7:15 I reached the bridge over the Connecticut River where New Hampshire begins. I wanted a good picture at the state line, so I asked a passerby if he'd do me a favor. He shrank like I'd pulled a gun on him, then said meekly ""From a distance..."".  I explained I just wanted a photo, if he didn't mind holding my camera. But it was too much for the poor man - he outright refused - and I told him it was no big deal. I took a selfie. I might add he was not wearing a mask when I first saw him.
So I entered Hanover, passing prominent signs that demanded everyone entering this protected enclave wear a mask. And nearly everyone was, even joggers, bikers, and people sitting by themselves far removed from others. It was surreal. In just the last few weeks I've been in cities like Great Barrington and Rutland, college towns like Williamstown, busy tourist attractions like Manchester and Bear Mountain, suburbs like Warwick, and countless small towns. All of which are getting along just fine without blanket mask mandates. Dartmouth and Hanover, I realized, hadn't really changed since I left them thirty years ago as an undergrad. They are still an island of provincial insanity masquerading as erudite and sophisticated. I longed for the normality of West Hartford, where jumping off a bridge is as crazy as it gets.
As I walked into town I smiled and greeted people who almost to a man were surprised to be spoken to on a public sidewalk. The one exception to masks is apparently when you are seated for dining. The sidewalks were jammed with outdoor diners, maskless, in animated conversations while waiting for their food. None of these tables were six feet apart. The rules we accept are strange indeed. If you stand up, you are a disease vector and must wear a mask. If you sit down, you enter an immunity zone. If you walk past someone for a second on a sidewalk or in a store you could kill them. If you eat next to them for an hour everyone will be fine. I slipped into the burrito place to satiate my hunger and was able to dine inside the empty restaurant. Beats sitting on a curb as I've often had to do. I worked my way over to the food market, already closed by 8, and was picked up by Evan from the Hanover Adventure hostel. 
At the hostel there were a couple of guys - Travis and Jason - who were LASHing Vermont to Katahdin and feeling beaten up by their first few days, an older guy named Bill just passing through, and a woman staying the week between houses. For such a large hostel it was a small crowd. Travis has a heart condition which caps how much blood his heart can pump, so climbing mountains is a long process for him. But he refuses to limit himself. He just adapts to what his body needs.
One of the employees was Calamity Jane, who turned out to be Bumblebee's sister. Bumblebee is the guy I hiked with in New Jersey and tented at Catfish firetower. He skipped a few hundred miles to Vermont and stayed here a few days. I just missed him by a day. He skipped again up to Moosilauke, but I'll catch him yet!","The Lookout

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630570,"My first zero since Pennsylvania. I was up early and made eggs and waffles in the hostel kitchen. The older guest, John, turned out to be en route to Maine to buy the Stratton motel, itself an AT hostel. I'll likely be one of his first customers.
Evan took me to town where at the post office I got my fourth - and hopefully final - pair of Altra Lone Peaks, a new screen protector for my phone, and all my winter gear from home. The forecast calls for a low in the 30s tomorrow night. Just in time!
A huge new building is going up on the outskirts of Dartmouth campus for the engineering school. But the core of campus seemed largely unchanged since my undergrad days, except for the large Berry library addition. Russell Sage (aka Sussell Rage), my old dorm, still has the same wooden bunks and Spartan accommodations in this age of glamping student housing. Dartmouth doesn't need perks to attract applicants. As a lark I went into the campus computer store to see what today's students are using. My freshman year, 1991, was the first to require students to buy a computer. Mac only. The most common unit was an all-in-one with a 7-inch black and white screen, 20MB hard drive, and 1MB RAM. And that seemed state-of-the-art. And the campus that made us use their proprietary email (Blitzmail) and instant message service now advertises their partnership with Google for office software.
After wandering around campus for an hour, not coming within ten feet of anyone, a woman yelled over to me that I needed a mask. I politely asked where I could get one. She pointed to a booth doling them out. When I asked the man there what the campus policy was, for instance did I need a mask if I was 50 feet away from you, he was friendly and said I needed to wear it in any public area, including the four acre college green. And yes, even if I'm 50 feet from everyone. So glad we have Ivy League schools to lead the way towards reason and common sense. I took note though that many of the college employees on break seemed to be exercising their civil disobedience.
Back at the hostel I talked with the long-term guest, Hannah. She is a Covid refugee from Chicago, waiting to get into an apartment in the area. She didn't know this was a hiker hostel until she started seeing smelly guys with huge packs coming in. 
Owner Bill hooked me up with an inner tube and pointed me to a popular spot on the Connecticut River called Patchem's Point. I tubed and swam in the warm river, watching some scullers from the college. When I got back I talked with my kids over Zoom for the first time in awhile, which made me happy. 
Drove into town to pick up Indian food with Bill, a fifty-something New Jersey retiree doing sections to finish up New Hampshire. He cut his mileage short today and still has a few miles to finish tomorrow. He has a busy vacation schedule between a vacation home, skiing, and traveling with his wife to the Virgin Islands, Cape Code and elsewhere that prevents longer hikes.
Declan came in - a tall lanky kid who worked at the Notch Hostel most of the season before starting a southbound hike. He turned 21 in Monson, but doesn't like the name he got: Mimosa.
Yard Sale rolled in later, and then Stitch and Big Dog. They got separated from Irish and Felix.
Sunrise came in after dark. A squarely-built young ex-Marine, he left Georgia April 28th. It was he who had pointed me in the right direction at the stream crossing yesterday. Friendly guy, I hope to see him again. 
We vegged and watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and a mismatched buddy comedy called Due Date. I ate so much I almost felt full. So good to just relax.","Hanover Co-op

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630578,"I took the first shuttle back to trail, leaving Sunrise, Yard Sale, Stitch, Big Dog, Travis and Jason. Stopped at the post office to mail a couple more things home I don't need, like my summer silk sleeping bag liner. Then headed to the Hanover Co-op to resupply. 
The Co-op has bulk food dispensers. A lot of them. Hanover has some interesting contrasts with my suburban Pennsylvania home town. There, the supermarkets removed bulk dispensers, because of Covid they said. And our schools are all virtual. But I walked by Hanover High School several times and it is swarming with kids. Yet you must wear a mask everywhere, even if you're the only person on the Green.
Hiking out of town I passed Bill, who I'd gotten Indian food with. He was finishing a few miles southbound that he'd missed yesterday. He's headed north to Moosilauke to do more sections so we may cross paths again. Seems to have a busy vacation schedule in his early retirement. He needs to meet his wife in Cape Cod for a couple of days first.
Easy trail the first eight miles, then some 1000-1500 foot climbs up Moose Mountain and Holt's Ledge.  Cool weather and low humidity made it easier than the Vermont rollercoaster.
Numerous road crossings like the last part of Vermont, but no nearby stores or delis. (sad face)
More stone walls, and long abandoned dirt roads. Some were named by wooden signs as if some old farmer were going to direct you down them (""ya con't get theah from heah"").  Passed a track signed ""Logging Road"" that looked narrower than the AT.
Pines, firs, and spruces dominated, with maples and oaks still plentiful. A few maples are beginning to turn, with fluffs of red dotting the hillsides.
I came across three sixtyish guys lunching on boulders. They had just started a section to Moosilauke. At the Moose Mountain summit a lady asked if I was dayhiking or thruhiking. I smiled. My pack is bigger and heavier with my winter quilt, clothes, and stove, but I guess it doesn't look quite big enough.
Two women resting there were southbounding. Water Worm and Bambi took two months to get here. Bambi thrued NOBO three years ago. They marveled that I might get to Katahdin before it closes in a month. I said the Kennebec ferry shutting down September 30th is my more pressing deadline. They think the Kennebec is easily fordable.
I stopped at Trapper John Shelter for dinner, not realizing it was a quarter mile off trail. Felix and Irish were there, having camped near Hanover last night. They already had a fire going. Irish had lugged the equivalent of four bottles of wine from town in a 3L water bag, intending to celebrate with his buddies. A father and son came in looking for a tent spot. Irish was blasting music, which he told me was to deter them from using the shelter, but turned it off a few minutes later. I mentioned Big Dog and Stitch weren't on the morning shuttle so might not make it here. This seemed to throw a wrench in their plans, but Irish was intent on getting a little crazy. I asked him to be considerate of the nearby tenters. Felix got the message without being asked. On the way out I chatted with the father and son. They were doing several sections of Vermont and New Hampshire, currently headed to Kinsman Notch north of Moosilauke. With his 12-year-old son I identified closely with them, and suggested they may want to choose a spot further from the shelter if they wanted a quiet night. Later I passed a SOBO headed to that shelter. I hope he helped keep things contained.
I hiked over six miles into the evening, including a 2100 foot climb up Smarts Mountain, to reach the old fire warden cabin now used as a shelter. It was already dusk and at first I couldn't find the cabin, only the summit's firetower. A SOBO walked past, hadn't seen any cabin, and went looking for a tentsite. But with my map and compass I found the cabin in the dark by dead reckoning. It was just fifty yards due east of the firetower. I was the only one there. But I had plenty of water, it was enclosed and out of the wind, and I was just happy to have made it this far. It was a good day. Before I turned in I climbed the firetower to catch a rainbow of fading light on the western horizon and the first stars making an appearance.","Hanover Co-op
",Smarts Mountain Fire Wardens Cabin,"Sep 11, Fri",22.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630645,"Very cold last night. Wore the gloves and long johns I had picked up in Hanover, along with the 20° quilt and fleece liner. Protected from the wind in the fire wardens cabin this setup was very comfortable. I was so comfy I rolled back over in the morning and didn't really wake up until 9. With the sun shining it was warmer on the porch than in the cabin so I went out to eat. Before waking I heard dayhikers walking by very early to catch the sunrise from the firetower.
In the cabin's log were entries from Water Queen, Roam, and Strider, hikers I last saw near Bland, Virginia. They had skipped up to hike the north before Katahdin closes. The entries were from 12 days ago. Don't know if I'll catch them again. 
Smarts Mountain felt like the first of the White Mountains. Technically it's part of the White Mountain National Forest. Though at 3200 feet it's a minor peak. Still, that was tall enough to require a four mile long descent. By the time I started climbing the next peak, Mount Cube, I felt tired and out of sorts. Maybe thirsty or low on calories? I'd had a substantial breakfast: peanut butter, an apple, and half a bag of veggie chips. I sat near a creek, filled up the water bottle, and tried drinking more. Ultimately I think the five minute rest did more good. I don't often just sit during the day. 
Mount Cube felt even more like a White Mountain with boulders and bedrock climbs. Though it topped off at only 2900 feet. The upper reaches are primarily evergreen, but deciduous trees dominate most of the mountain. From the peak I could see blotches of red across the canvas of green hills.
Another long descent, then over much smaller Ore Hill. There I looked in vain for the privy at Ore Hill Campsite. I am always amazed at how well hidden the privies are and how poor the signage. How about a specially blazed trail to help out hikers in an emergency - maybe brown? :P
The afternoon was fading as I reached route 25C. I was still six miles from the shelter. But there was a restaurant just a quarter mile up the road, the first convenient amenity in forty miles, that I was not going to pass up. 
The Greenhouse Restaurant has the feel of an English pub with a central bar surrounded by tables, some with families. A band was setting up for live music. A bunch of locals came and went, while the Merlin-bearded owner cum bartender held court, entertained, and bantered with his guests. In sharp contrast to Hanover, and more like everywhere else along the AT, rural New Hampshire seems to be indifferent to masks and the anxiety that still grips urban areas. In fact of all the dayhikers I passed today not one fumbled around trying to put on a mask when they saw someone coming. Contrast to northern Virginia, backyard of the DC suburbs, where dayhikers would not only walk around in masks but step off trail and turn their back to you without a word of greeting, like some sort of shunning. Anyway, these locals were my kind of people, friendly and down-to-earth.
I put away a quesadilla and a small pizza before returning to the trail. I was barely over Mount Mist before darkness overcame the forest. I hiked the last four miles by headlamp. Night hiking has been another activity outside my comfort zone. But I've been doing more of it during this thruhike. Although with rough trail it requires more attention, it's also quite peaceful and absorbing. The evening was dry and cool, perfect weather for hiking. 
The stars were blazing as I crossed route 25 and then carefully rockhopped over Oliverian Brook. Some dayhikers (nighthikers?) passed headed for the road. Must have caught the sunset on Moosilauke. Some uphill brought me along Jeffers Brook to the shelter which, fortunately, was empty. No fear of disturbing anyone at this hour. I could see lights from a tent in the trees. After I was settled in a new hiker came around with a headlamp but apparently opted to tent.","Smarts Mountain Fire Wardens Cabin
",Jeffers Brook Shelter,"Sep 12, Sat",21
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630662,"Woke early and chatted with the tenter who arrived late. He had left his home in Ithaca, New York and followed the Finger Lakes Trail to the Catskills. Through a series of other trails he made his way to the AT and headed north. I had more questions but just then the occupant of the tent I saw as I came in last night walked up. 
It was Rooster! I haven't seen him since the  Lickskillet hostel in Virginia 1200 miles ago. Wow, what a long time that seems, but it was only two months ago. He seems to be holding up well after Maine and the Whites. He's headed to Harpers Ferry to finish.
I headed up Mt. Moosilauke. It's over four miles of nearly continuous climbing ranging up to 1800 feet per mile of elevation gain.  It's not as technical a climb as some of the other Whites. Just steep. But it's not to be taken lightly. In all it's 3800 feet from road to summit, compared to Katahdin's 4200 foot gain. I passed a few dayhikers on the way up, but for a beautiful Sunday it didn't seem that busy.
At the summit I met southbounder Mail Man, napping behind a stone wall out of the high winds that buffeted the hikers. He was waiting for his buddy Hoot Owl, who I ran into later. Hoot Owl started in Georgia on June 29th and flipped up from Erwin, Tennessee. 
I called a shuttler from the summit then scrambled down boulders, ledges, and steep bedrock with wooden steps driven in. On a dry day this was all a bit fun if jarring to the joints. On a wet day it would be a slog. I have to say my knees and ankles are holding up really well. Perhaps I've strengthened them, or at least the muscles around them. I've heard young guys complain about their knees, but other than an occasional twinge I haven't felt any pain or discomfort.
My shuttler met me early at the road and took me to the Notch Hostel. It was early for check-in, an unusual rule for a hiker hostel, but Mike booked me into a bunk. He did give me a hard time at first, apparently because I couldn't find my buff and they are a bit Covid crazy here. I found it stuffed in my stove to quiet some rattling. 
After showering I borrowed a bike and rode the two miles to Lincoln for a Mexican dinner and resupply. When I returned Dabs, Copper and another southbounder had rolled in. Trash, the section hiker from Hanover, had also checked in, having returned from his Cape Cod weekend with the wife. He's planning several sections in the Whites. We arranged to hike Kinsman ridge together tomorrow as a slackpack. It's a tough but doable day.
In the evening I put on my real world hat for awhile to host a committee meeting for my son's Cub Scout pack over Zoom. It's a challenging time to run a youth group, and especially so remotely. Town is really the only time I can catch up on responsibilities like this.","Jeffers Brook Shelter
",Kinsman Notch (North Woodstock),"Sep 13, Sun",8.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630722,"Slackpacked the Kinsman Ridge with Trash today. Trash (Bill) is a retired corporate treasurer turned Treasury agent and fraud investigator. He now divides his time between skiing in Utah, diving in St. Croix, and hiking AT sections. Guy doesn't know how to slow down!  I met him in Hanover before he took off for a weekend in Cape Cod with his wife and friends. Now he's back to finish up New Hampshire. He'd planned to start with the Moosilauke section I did yesterday, but flipped his schedule so we could hike together today. I haven't had a hiking partner since my daughter Snickers came out for a couple days in Pennsylvania so I was happy to have company. I remembered Kinsman as a very challenging stretch. When I section-hiked the north I'd gone over Moosilauke and straight into the Kinsman ridge thinking I'd finish it the same day. Big mistake. Hours later I struggled into Eliza Brook Shelter at dusk, having only done half - the easier half - of the ridge. I Nero-ed the next day.
Trash drove us to Franconia Notch in his Audi TT where Marlene of Ali's Taxi (named after her grandchildren) met us at 7 and took us over to Kinsman Notch. Marlene charges only $5 per person for trips I wouldn't be surprised to pay $20 for in other areas. Don't know how she does it. She, like Roger in Waynesboro and others I've met, also drives locals to work and errands, not just hikers.
The ridge started out with a climb as they always do, and Trash soon decided he was holding me back. But I was actually enjoying slowing my pace. It would take longer, but I had the whole day. And it was much less taxing. The climb wasn't bad at all. In fact all morning I kept wondering what had been so bad about Kinsman. Sure it had lots of rocks and boulders and sharp ups and downs, but that was becoming my new normal in NH and Maine.
The weather was chilly and windy, my first real taste of winter this year.
We passed some tranquil and scenic ponds, and the ridge started to seem downright pleasant. Had lunch at Eliza Brook Shelter, situated by a crystal clear stream. The shelter itself looked almost brand new, despite being a decade old. Not a mark of graphitti or carving on it. The logs were expertedly cut to join perfectly at the corners. All of it apparently done on site, and some of the logs weighing over 400 pounds. A simple note in the shelter asked occupants to respect the labor that went into it, and they have.
Halfway in we started climbing South Kinsman Mountain. It was pretty brutal. I hadn't encountered anything as unremitting as this climb on the hike before. The boulders just didn't stop. I had my trekking poles stowed away the entire day because the moment I was tempted to take them out I needed my hands again to clamber up some bedrock or ledges. They are now just dead weight on my pack, necessary only to erect my tent.
Near the summit we met flip-floppers Mountain Goat and Miles-A-Foot. I recognized them immediately, either from Instagram photos or from meeting them in Virginia. None of us could remember. They had both just reached their personal AT halfway point. I made them promise to eat their half gallon of ice cream in the next town. Ironically it was cold enough that we'd all started donning jackets from standing around too long, so off we hurried to warm up again.
Further on we passed Dabs and Copper, who'd stayed at the hostel, heading south. But more surprising was a family of four, with two teenage girls, dayhiking and already over North Kinsman but heading further from the road. With over seven miles to get back and already past mid-afternoon I wondered how far they planned to go. They must have as well, as we heard them arguing in Chinese after we passed. Their string backpacks didn't look prepared for bad weather, darkness, or running short of water.
The terrain remained strenuous and tiring. I remembered now why it ground me down last time. On one summit, North Kinsman I think, a giant cairn of stones was formed into a throne. A momentary lull in the march. Then we descended North Kinsman at literally 1 mph thanks to endless boulder scrambles. Trash thought he was slowing me down. But it wasn't him, it was me adapting to my new reality and practicing my rock hopping for much more to come. 
The trail relented a bit at Lonesome Lake Hut. The hut was open and the croo cook inside fried me up a large quesadilla and poured me a hot cocoa. I'd had a good-sized pastrami sandwich for lunch but I scarfed the quesadilla down like I hadn't eaten for days. After that it was a relatively (relatively) easy several miles to the road, and a mile walk down a paved bike path to reach the Flume visitors center where we'd left the car.
All told it took 10 1/2 hours to go 17 miles, a definite hit to my usual 3 mph. Again, primarily due to the terrain. 
Once back at the hostel and showered Trash offered to drive us to town to eat at the Woodstock Inn. There was a long wait for an inside table as even in the valley it was quite chilly in the evening. Had a huge open-faced meatloaf and mashed potatoes ""sandwich"" and a flight of local microbrews. That was enough to put me to sleep nice and early.","Kinsman Notch (North Woodstock)
",Franconia Notch,"Sep 14, Mon",16.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630753,"I slept like a baby for about ten hours, recovering from the Kinsman Ridge (and a flight of microbrews). Trash left for another slackpack and Marlene dropped me off in Franconia Notch. Normally you have to walk a mile up a bike path to reach the trailhead from the nearest parking lot but Marlene took me up I-93 and pulled off where I could bushwhack a hundred yards to the trail. She urged me to hustle as the state troopers apparently don't like this tactic.
The climb up Liberty Springs Trail is as aerobic as Moosilauke and not very technical. Very few hikers started as late (9 am) as I did, but I ran into several dozen once up on the ridge. Many were backpacking the Pemi Loop, which is a 30-ish mile circumambulation of the magnificent Pemigewasset Wilderness. It's typically done as a 3-4 day hike. Of course most of the hikers were out for the day, enjoying the perfect fall weather, and these all disappeared once I passed Mount Lafayette.
I've hiked Franconia Ridge twice before but it always takes my breath away. Today was absolutely gorgeous. Not a cloud in the sky, ideal temperature for hiking and, amazingly, no wind. Lafayette is notoriously gusty, but it was eerily calm on top. I could see the Kinsmans and Cannon Mountain on one side, including the bare cliffs that once hosted New Hampshire's iconic profile of the Old Man. On the other side the Presidential Range was crystal clear, with Washington rising like a volcanic wasteland .
The alpine zone here was treeless, but not devoid of life. Amongst the low-growing plants and lichen I watched a chipmunk poke around, perhaps looking for hiker food scraps.
I hadn't committed to a hiking plan when I started out today, but after making decent time I decided to push for a 16-17 mile day. That would get me past the most challenging climbs in this section, and position me to cross both Franconia and the Presidentials in three days so I could reach Gorham, where I hope to stay for both a zero and a day of slackpacking. 
Town is attractive partly because the nights are getting much colder more quickly than I expected. The last few nights at elevation have been 40 or below. It's a bit unseasonal. Temps probably won't drop below the 30s even in Maine in early October based on the last few years. During the day the high at elevation seems to be below 50. Without wind and in the sun that's pleasant hiking. But when the wind is blowing like yesterday it's quite cold.
The trail became much rougher after Lafayette. The seven miles down and over Garfield and South Twin were full of boulders, hand-over-hand scrambling, sharp ups and down, and were generally pretty exhausting. A lot like Kinsman ridge, in fact. South Twin was an 1100 foot climb that is the steepest yet, possibly one of the steepest on the trail, with vertical gain up to 2100 feet per mile. 
I reached the summit of South Twin around 5 to find a hiker eating dinner. His rock commanded s striking view of Mount Washington. He was doing the Pemi Loop and had thruhiked the AT in 2007. I was cooling down quickly in the wind and had to get moving again.
Following South Twin the trail became relatively easy, though still studded with rocks, several miles to Mount Guyot. 
On the down slope I found a stealth spot. The tent barely fit between several rocks and still had roots under it, but it was the best available. I had almost an hour until sunset, unusually early for me to stop, but it was already getting cold and I wanted to be set up and in my sleeping bag by dark. I boiled water for tea, using my stove for the first time, and ate hummus I'd not gotten around to eating in town. It packs quite a lot of calories, and I love it, but it's not at all weight-efficient.
Several hikers went by after I turned in. Not for me. I might be fine with a little night-hiking now, but not when the trail is a river of boulders, and not when the temperature is plunging into the 30s. I'm toasty warm under my quilt. Though these knit gloves leave a lot to be desired.","Franconia Notch
",Stealth site on Mt. Guyot mile 1836.1,"Sep 15, Tue",16.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630760,"Cold but calm in the morning. Though not as cold as forecast, even here at 4500 feet. I got moving early and ate breakfast while hiking - an apple and a couple blueberry breakfast bars.
The first few miles went along the Zealand Ridge, passing some great views of Whitewall Slide, an exposed cliff. I met several dayhiking couples who came up early by the Zealand side trail. Also out were a backpacking couple in their sixties, and SOBOs Zan and Skipper, who started from Katahdin in the first half of August. 
There was no water until Zealand Falls Hut, a steep climb down from the ridge. The hut was still operating but didn't open until 11 so I missed a lunch opportunity. Oh well! Had to keep moving if I didn't want to climb Webster Cliffs in the dark.
After Zealand Falls the trail turned to a level dirt path for several miles. I crossed paths with Trash once again. He was on his last section to finish New Hampshire, heading south to Franconia Notch. Congrats Trash!
The trail followed a wide river valley with an unusually open view, including a traverse of a boulder field through Whitewall Slide. It was dirt trail with only occasional rocky sections all the way down to Crawford Notch.
There I decided against hitching to a gas station or deli for lunch. The nearest was 8 miles away and it would likely take over an hour with hitching. Better to start the climb, get done early, wake up early, and get to town tomorrow evening. Be a day ahead of plan and give me some flexibility if I need it later.
The climb up to Webster Cliffs was mostly a rock staircase but not too technical. However the last thousand feet up to Mt. Webster threw in many tricky ledge scrambles. Very slow going. Was barely doing a mile an hour in places. Glad I didn't hitch out for lunch. 
On Mt. Webster I met a soft-spoken hiker named, appropriately, Speak Up. He and his girlfriend are hiking Moosilauke to Katahdin using two vehicles to slackpack themselves along the way. He thruhiked in 2017.
After calm air yesterday, overnight, and this morning, the wind picked up in Crawford Notch. On the cliffs they were quite strong. I stopped in a protected stretch to use cell service to reserve entry to the Mt. Washington visitor center tomorrow. Without a reservation I can't get into the building, and I can't get lunch! 
The three mile walk from Webster over Mt. Jackson to Nauman Campsite went quickly, though there were many boulders to climb. There the Mizpah Springs Hut was shuttered and the water turned off. The only water between Crawford Notch and Mt. Washington is a puddle by the campsite. 
The campsite caretaker was gone for the season. A couple from Connecticut was setting up on one of the tent platforms. They were here for their anniversary. They try to get up here every year around this time, after the crowds and heat have gone. They offered me their map to photograph, as there are so many trails in this area. 
A hiker from Vermont popped in - he thruhiked the AT in '15 and did most of the PCT in '17 until he developed a stress fracture. Currently he's poking around the Presidentials and plans to hike the Long Trail in a few weeks. Gave us a trip report of what we'll see tomorrow.
I pitched my tent on one of the precious few dirt patches. The campsite has seven wooden platforms but my trekking pole tent needs to be well staked and tying the lines to boards doesn't hold up well. Cooked up a hot noodle dinner with some chicken thrown in, and ate most of what was in my dinner bag. I'm burning the ship for tomorrow - no food means it's town or bust!
The wind is really whipping up this evening. The temperature should be about the same as last night, but it will feel colder. At least, outside of my cozy quilt.","Stealth site on Mt. Guyot mile 1836.1
",Nauman Campsite,"Sep 16, Wed",17.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630761,"I was up earlier than ever for a long day over one of the most difficult and scenic stretches of trail - the Presidential Range.
The last two days had been crystal clear. But a mass of clouds moved in overnight and hung at 5000 feet. Consequently I spent most of the day in or just under the clouds. Mist swirled around, or flew rapidly over the cols between the summits. The wind was furious on the western side of the ridge. But drop a few feet below the eastern side and all was calm. 
The trail was as challenging as any section, especially climbing over Pierce and up to Franklin. Once above treeline there was less climbing, but the path was never straightforward. I took side trails to summit Eisenhower and Monroe, which the AT bypasses. The fog and wind were all-encompassing at the peaks. I felt like a mountaineer more than a hiker. These were summits worth conquering. 
I saw only one pair of hikers in the first six miles. More than I expected, frankly, given I'd seen no others camping at treeline and it was too far and too early for dayhikers.
The hut at Lakes of the Clouds was not yet open when I passed. I would have been disappointed if not for Mt. Washington coming up. That climb was surprisingly less steep than it looked on the profile. But it was nothing but boulders. In fact the entire hike from Lakes until I dipped back below treeline beyond Madison was nothing but rocks and boulders. Some smooth and worn, some raw and rough. Some laid like pavers, most left in their natural state pointing in every direction. Blazes were almost non-existent. Stone cairns marked the path.  
I passed several groups of hikers ascending Washington. Droplets fell as I neared the summit. More from condensation than outright precipitation. I was, after all, walking in a cloud. A girl passed carrying a wooden rack on her back like a backpack, stacked with boxes. She was resupplying the Lakes of the Clouds hut. A croo member typically carries in fresh supplies whenever they start their ten day stint. 
Although the wind was whipping and visibility was nil there was still a line to get a summit picture. In the few minutes I waited the sun started to come out, then rain and sleet returned. The couple ahead of me asked if I'd hiked up the mountain. Yes, I did. Where did I start? Georgia. Really, Georgia? Yes, Georgia. I walked here from Georgia. 
I walked here from Georgia. It echoed in my head. I could hardly believe it myself.
Though I had made a reservation to enter the building, which is currently limited to 75 occupants, there were so few people I didn't need it. Most had come by cog train rather than car. A very kind lady at the information desk gave me change for the penny machine - my son collects them - as well as a binoculars souvenir, and stamped my AT passport. Then it was on to the snack bar. Unfortunately the kitchen was closed, so no hot food. But I made do with what there was.
I shared a table with the only other backpackers in the cafeteria. T-Bone (AT '13) was hiking with his brother and friend. All are retired Air Force in their late forties or fifties, and hiking Kinsman to Gorham. They aim to get out for two adventures a year. Patagonia, the Sierras, and Colorado came up. 
Back out into the fierce winds and rain. The gusts were forecasted to be 75 mph and that felt about right. They subsided somewhat as I dropped below 6000 feet again. The fog was total. Visibility was fifty yards. I could hear the cog train but could not see it. In fact even miles away on Mt. Madison I continued to hear its occasional whistle.
The trail remained all rocks. Once I got closer to 5000 feet it cleared up around me. I took a side trail over Mt. Jefferson but not Adams. I did Adams two years again with my son Big E. It is literally a huge pile of sharp boulders and exhausting to climb. There was nothing to see at either peak in any case. Unsurprisingly there were few hikers on this stretch.
Madison Springs Hut was closed for the season. But thankfully the water spigot was still running. I headed up Mt. Madison. 
On the way up I met Speak Up and his girlfriend Lana again. They broke the Presis into two dayhikes using a side trail off Mt.  Jefferson. One of their vehicles is a converted van they sleep in each night.
At Madison's windy summit I found a family of four. They had just completed the NH 48 - that's the 48 peaks that are 4000 feet or higher. The two daughters were around eight or nine years old. Quite an achievement!
The climb down Madison was stunning, but unrelenting. For over a mile it roller-coastered over rocky promontories, each one hidden by the previous one. Then it dropped steeply below tree level. Nearly 3000 feet down in two and a half miles.
Once on relatively flat ground I crushed the last five miles to Pinkham Notch. I saw no one between Madison and the Notch. I grabbed a soda and postcards at the visitors center which, amazingly, was still open. Even more amazing I had enough cell service to call Paul at the Barn Hostel for a pickup. He drove me the 11 miles to Gorham along a stretch of road notorious for nocturnal moose activity. Locals avoid driving it after dark. Paul told me four people he knew had died in collisions with the 1600-pound beasts in just the last few years. 
While Gorham is known by hikers, it's also a Mecca for ATV enthusiasts. Paul gave me some lowdown on the strain between the boost to the local economy and the loutish behavior of some of the drivers that has local property owners trying to shut down the ATV trails. 
In downtown Gorham, Paul runs the Barn Hostel in the Libby House B&B in a beautifully restored Victorian once owned by the lumber baron of that name. The hiker hostel is in the carriage house, with beds in the hayloft. He bought it ten years ago but the hostel goes back almost forty years, one of the oldest on trail. Paul went well out of his way for me. He had closed the hostel temporarily for a death in the family but insisted on bringing me in anyway. I am the only one here tonight. After a hot shower and some Italian food I feel ready to tackle the 21 mile Wildcat section tomorrow.","Nauman Campsite
",Pinkham Notch,"Sep 17, Thu",19.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630802,"Today I planned a slackpack of the Wildcat-Carter-Moriah range east of Mt. Washington. It's 21 miles and tough. But commonly done in a day. Last time I came through it took ten hours. I'm figuring more like eleven this time. 
Two thruhikers drove in to the hostel early to join me on the shuttle to Pinkham Notch. Poncho (AT '18, '19, '20) and Won't Get Up (AT '19, '20) are both multiple thruhikers. This year they started in March and eventually flipped to Katahdin. They missed this section and are back to fill it in. Both are very energetic and free-spirited, and both appear to be pushing fifty. I could hardly get a word in edgewise with Won't Get Up. She's a mile a minute and seems to say whatever crosses her mind. Poncho is of fewer words but always has a broad grin.
Driving down Rt 16 I could see the fall colors now unmistakably creeping across the lower slopes. It was a clear, cool, and sunny day, looking like perfect hiking weather. I'm not complaining, but yesterday's hike over Washington was the only day in the last four or five that it wasn't in the clear. Instead I got a far more interesting - and less crowded - experience.
The day started with a huge, steep boulder scramble up to the Wildcats. No surprise - this is my new normal. Not the first or the last or the worst climb. Soon my sweat was dripping on the boulders like rain drops. I took it nice and easy. 
Eventually I heard someone with a trekking pole gaining on me. Crazy! I haven't been passed by anyone - not a soul - since Sunshine back in Virginia. When he caught up we hiked together over the four Wildcat peaks. It turned out to be a thruhiker named Muck Fichigan who I recognized from Instagram. He's attempting to yo-yo the trail in a loose definition of the term. He's been more or less on trail since a year ago September flipping around to hike the entire AT both north- and southbound. His name comes from being an Ohio State fan. Once he reaches Katahdin he still has 1100 miles in the middle to hike northbound. He's had more than his share of bad weather. He hiked through January, took February off, and by April was hiking in Vermont. What he didn't expect was for it to be still covered in deep snow. He had to posthole through it. At one point he ran out of food, was cold and wet, and had nearly a dead phone battery, but couldn't get to a motel or hostel because the governor had shuttered all the businesses. He gave in and called his brother for help. Muck is forty-nine.
7 miles in to the hike I met Hercules going southbound. Paul had mentioned him, that he was doing this section in two days and coming back to the hostel tonight. So I'll catch up with him later. He hikes in sandals, hence the name. Though he also beard a passing resemblance to the Disney version, with wild curly locks.
In a random stretch of forest I noticed a critter jumping between the trees. It was the size of a small fox, gray/brown with a yellow neck with dark flecks. It made ""rmmf rmmf"" noises. Maybe a pine marten?
Of all the dozen or so peaks in this section Mt. Hight offered the best 360 view. On such a clear day I was probably able to see a hundred miles in all directions. Except to the west, which was blocked by the Presidentials. Incredible that Mt. Washington is now behind me. I'd been gazing at it on the horizon for days, and now it will be receding in my rear view mirror.
For the third time I crossed paths with Speak Up and Lana, this time near Mt. Moriah. They've been slackpacking themselves with two vehicles, and have moved north from the Presidentials. We'll likely meet again in the Gorham to Grafton Notch section in a couple days. 
Muck Fichigan took off ahead of me to make a 6pm shuttle at Rattle River hostel. I stopped to take a short but steep side trail to the summit of Mt. Moriah, then flew down trail after him. The last two or three miles I was doing 4 mph or better as the terrain was dirt trail with a slight downslope that followed the valley of the Rattle River.
At the trailhead on route 2 an Asian lady eating spaghetti in her car called out to me asking about trail conditions. I finagled a ride to town from her. Her hiking friends call her Crazy Kim. She's hiking Maine with a large group and planning next to hike the Mahoosucs just to the north. The other 11 hikers are staying in Rattle River hostel while she sleeps in her car. Incredibly she's bagged all of the 115 4000-footers in the Northeast (46 in the Adirondacks, 48 in NH, 5 in Vermont, 14 in Maine), all on weekend trips from New York. Pretty impressive to squeeze all that peakbagging in. 
Back at the hostel I let myself in through the lower barn in the rear since Paul was still away. Hercules didn't get to Pinkham Notch until after dark. Paul was unhappy about driving down the moose corridor but picked him up anyway. He is very devoted to helping hikers. 
I spent the evening hanging out with Hercules, who's actually a flip-flopper who started out intending only to hike from Georgia for two weeks then kept on going. He started in mid-July, then flipped from Roan Mountain to Katahdin. A fellow software guy in real life, we had some common experiences. Ordered pizzas and binge-watched Cobra Kai on Netflix. I'm apparently a sucker for an 80s-homage series.","Pinkham Notch

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630863,"Cold night - the Barn, an old carriage house, is unheated so the 23 degree night seeped in. Wore my puffy while enjoying a lazy morning around the hostel. Walked over to the hardware store / outfitter to look for better gloves. Strolled up and down the town's main drag past a large park, a tourist center advertising moose tours, and a moose-themed mini golf. Lots of ATVs, Polaris, and other 4-wheel drives growled by on the road, heading for the local trails. 
Hung out with hostel mate Hercules, the accidental thruhiker. He's spent the better part of a week in Gorham, and hiking nearby, waiting on shipments of cold weather gear from home. He finally got them, plus more food than he can eat, and is hiking out tomorrow.
I talked with the family over zoom. It's been a month since I returned to the trail and I'll be back home in a few weeks. While I love seeing their faces and hearing their stories, it's hard not being able to reach out and hug them. 
A little diversion helped my home sickness. The town library hosted a bagpipe performance in the park as a fundraiser. The fellow was decked out like a highlander and was truly skilled. He played a variety of both classic Scottish tunes as well as some patriotic and popular melodies. I've never seen anything like it.
Paul took me over to Walmart where I amazingly found hiking pants - synthetic, breathable, and stretchable. From Wrangler no less. What a find! This cold snap has been too much for my strategy of wearing shorts all day. Gloves were a lesser success - they hadn't yet received their shipment of men's gloves - odd, since they usually start selling bathing suits in January and winter coats in July - so all I could find was a large pair of boys' ski gloves. Better than my knit gloves which sport multiple holes.
Back at the hostel an elderly couple dropped by to visit. They turned out to be the previous owners of the property and founders of the hostel. Maggie and her husband ""Dreamcatcher"" owned the house for over twenty years and opened the hostel in 1985. Maggie, a Boston radiologist, started it fortuitously by allowing a cold, wet young hiker to sleep in the barn one evening while they were restoring the house. Word spread and more hikers showed up each year. They had all kinds of stories. There was the hiker who wouldn't leave - always had one excuse or another - until after three weeks they had to give him the boot. They'd frequently host 40 or more tents in the yard, until the town told them the front yard was off-limits. They eventually moved south for work - Dreamcatcher is a teacher - and haven't been back for fifteen years. I'm lucky to have been there today to hear a bit of trail lore and history.
Two new hikers came in for the night. Amazing is a highly energetic middle-aged woman who seems about to burst with enthusiasm. She has a complicated hike she calls a triple flop which seems to have started in New York. Recently she ran out of food in Vermont, was given vegetables by a farmer, and slept in someone's barn. She got a ride from Hanover to Gorham in Odie's school bus (the Hiker Yearbook guy). She's had eleven surgeries and wants to help other hikers learn self-care, both physically and spiritually. 
Paul also brought in a girl named Ryan who's been hiking south from Monson through the Whites with a friend. Her hiking buddy is visiting Burlington for a couple days. She was fairly quiet but hungry, went to bed early, and was still sleeping when I left the next day. Thanks to the new arrivals Paul lost a bet with his cousin (who runs the B&B side) that there wouldn't be any more hikers this season.
Tonight is going to be another unseasonably cold night, and tomorrow morning promises to be freezing. But I'll be hiking out regardless.","US 2 (Gorham)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630879,"Got up early and cooked eggs and bacon I'd picked up at Walmart for Hercules, Amazing, and myself. Amazing was characteristically jubilant to have eggs for the first time in apparently a long time. Paul drove me to the trail about 7:30. Walked a mile on back roads, passing a hydroelectric power plant on the Androscoggin River.
Met several backpackers sectioning the Mahoosucs. There's a traverse, as well as several loop trails that use the AT. A guy named Matt is hiking New Hampshire southbound, having gotten on at the Maine border using a side trail. He asked how bad the next climb is. What climb, I asked? I hadn't even noticed it was descending. 
The trail was pretty easy for most of the day. A few sharp ups and downs and the ubiquitous rocks, of course. But also long stretches of dirt trail. I passed a few ponds full of lilypads. Much of the higher ground was bedrock. Several mostly open summits with spectacular views back to Mt. Washington and other ranges in the Whites as well as ranges to the east and north in Maine.
Crossed paths with an older thruhiker named Fossil. He hiked from Gorham to Virginia and is now doing Grafton Notch to Gorham. Then he'll flip up to Katahdin. So I should see him again in a week or two. At this point in the season everyone's trying to finish Katahdin before it's too late.
I stopped at a sunny bedrock summit and perched on a rock, cleaning out my peanut butter jar. A girl came by who's been out hiking for 9 days through Maine. Her pack was huge, but she was happy it was so much lighter than when she started.
Crossed into Maine a half mile before the shelter turnoff. Soon after the border the trail dipped into the col down a seriously steep jumble of boulders.
The Carlo Col Shelter was empty. It's mostly enclosed but for a small doorway. It's a double decker. Hopefully it holds the heat well. 
The water source was just puddles. I froze my hands scooping out a liter for cooking dinner. Knorr's cheese and broccoli rice, Earl Grey tea, and peanut butter M&Ms. The sun set over the mountains behind the trees surrounding the shelter. It must have already been in the thirties, so I hustled under my quilt for an early night.
An older guy named Wild and Muck Fichigan stumbled in (literally) well after dark. Both had wanted to cross into Maine before the day ended.","US 2 (Gorham)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630889,"Wild, my shelter mate, just got back on trail after DJ-ing a couple of weddings back home in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania. He'd committed to them before he had to get off trail in March and got back on in May. He's wanted to hike the AT since getting lost on a church group outing and discovering, after some initial fear, peace in the woods.
We hiked most of the day together, over three peaks of Goose Eye Mountain and through Mahoosuc Notch. I figured it was best to have a hiking buddy going through that mess of boulders.
We met Danventure, a retired cop from State College, Pennsylvania. He was a rookie when I attended Penn State. Glad we didn't have a reason to meet then! Also saw Speak Up and Lana for the fourth time going southbound. They are bouncing north several more times to Katahdin so I am sure to see them again. 
Mahoosuc Notch was more of a puzzle than a physical challenge. Sometimes just finding the right path took a minute. We had to squeeze under the boulders a couple of times. Wild, who vlogs on YouTube as Wild on the Trail, had me film him squeezing out of a narrow gap and joked that it looked like Mahoosuc Notch was giving birth to its newest thruhiker.
We had a bite after the Notch before tackling the stiff Mahoosuc Arm climb. It was already mid-afternoon and I had another seven tough miles to reach Grafton Notch so I could be picked up by The Cabin hostel. So I said goodbye to Wild and took off. The Arm was tough but not worse than other big climbs. At the top, Speck Pond sparkled in the sunlight. I climbed further to the top of Old Speck, then flew downhill on an empty trail to Grafton Notch to meet my shuttle.
Hopper from The Cabin met me. I stayed there in 2017 and she remembered me. Among other mishaps I'd lost my hiking shirt the day I arrived. It was so hot I'd taken it off and strung it on the backpack to dry out. During some descent I must have scooted down on my butt and lost the shirt to the boulders. Hopper had given me one of the hostel's loaner shirts, a Celestial Seasonings ""Tea"" shirt, with a Lao Tze quote ""Nature does not hurry, yet everything is done.""
At the hostel, a rambling wood-sided home outside of Andover with a basement bunkhouse, we had the ample leftovers of a meatloaf dinner. Honey, the hostel owner, is 88 and a lifelong Mainer, hiker, and trail maintainer. She still goes for a hike in the White Mountains every July for her birthday. There are several trailers on the property including one with a tenant. Two former thruhikers who met on trail also live on site in a large tent.
Soon after dinner I was overcome by fatigue and turned in early. Tomorrow I slackpack.","Carlo Col Shelter
",Grafton Notch,"Sep 21, Mon",14.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630899,"Hopper made a large breakfast of pancakes, sausage, potatoes, and eggs to send me off on my unambitious ten mile slackpack. She dropped me off at Grafton Notch then went to nearby Screw Augur Falls to photograph the fall colors. Screw Augur Falls is a popular spot that gets its name from the pits that have been carved by rocks swirling around in eddys, as if gouged by an augur.
The trail was fairly easy heading towards Baldpate, especially so with a light pack. I met Spurs coming out of West Bethel. A Texan, he sports a Spurs cap and shirt. He started hiking in February, got off in March, returned in May, and needs to finish some of TN/NC after Katahdin. He's lost over 100 pounds on the trail. But he was dragging today under the weight of a resupply.
West Baldpate was mostly wooded. Descending into the saddle, with autumnal beauty spread across the valleys below, I passed a SOBO couple busy in conversation. ""Where you headed?"" I called. ""Georgia!"" was the terse reply. ""Give my regards!"" They kept hiking without missing a beat, but began singing ""Georgia on my Mind"".
East Baldpate is covered in sheer bedrock and requires climbing at an improbable slope. Thankfully it's been dry. In fact there have been none of the damp rocks or mud I remember covering the Maine trail. A dreadlocked kid named Lionheart passed going south. Outside his pack hung a reusable grocery bag filled with gear, looking more tramp than hiker. He apologized that he had to keep moving because he was chilled. The wind had indeed risen as I neared the summit, and the ambient temperature was probably still in the 40s.
The views continued to be absolutely gorgeous as I rounded and descended Baldpate. Truly a perfect day to be out for a hike in this magnificent area.
Down at the next shelter I stopped to eat the breakfast leftovers Hopper had sent out with me and chatted with a northbounders named What's Left. He hiked 1400 miles of the AT in 1978 before going home after a very cold and wet ascent of Katahdin. He didn't return to the trail for over forty years. Then last year he came back to finish it, popped a knee in Massachusetts, got surgery, and came back again this year to finish it up. He has only 130 miles left. 
The forest critters are back to busily preparing for winter now that the cold snap is over. Red squirrels and chipmunks scampered about all day.
Hopper met me at East B Hill road after ten miles. I rolled in at exactly two, the time I'd arranged when I was dropped off. There's a bit of adjustment throughout the day, but it's scary how accurate I can be with my hiking time. Yesterday I'd told her I'd be in Grafton Notch before 6:30, probably 6:15. It was 6:14 when I arrived.
We returned to the hostel via Mills Market, the only food establishment in Andover, where I got lunch. Sure, dinner was in three hours, but I would easily be hungry again by then. 
The tenting couple are Swan and Rusty. They hiked most of the trail last year, meeting along the way and marrying afterwards. Swan, a Georgian, plays guitar Andy Griffith-style. He broke his foot in New Hampshire and had to get off trail. That left Rusty, from Michigan, to finish on her own as the weather turned cold and nasty. Eventually she stopped a few dozen miles short. She finished those miles this year. They moved briefly to New Orleans, then Georgia, but decided they loved Maine. Rusty is a talented artist who's painted a mural at Boots Off hostel and works on oil landscapes of Maine.
The RV tenant is Malcolm, who thruhiked the AT in 1977. He longs to return to hiking, planning to hit the PCT in 2022 and the Florida Trail this winter, but developed plantar fasciitis while hiking Katahdin in August and is trying to work through that.
Also wandering around are Honey's new dog Paloma, a two-year-old rescue still being trained, and Leila, Rusty's older dog.
At family dinner, which also included Honey's stepson Don, we feasted on corned beef, potatoes, and cabbage, and plenty of it. And brownies for dessert. The dining room is filled with photos and memorabilia of hikers. Earl Schaffer, who stayed here in 1998, various groups organized by Warren Doyle, numerous Wounded Warrior groups. Honey seems to know everyone in the hiking world.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630900,"Another slackpack today. Groggier waking up. It was much warmer this morning. Hopper made omelets for us. It was easy terrain gradually climbing Wyman Mountain. Tons of fall color. Even the steep climb later up Moody Mountain wasn't bad when taking it slow with a light pack. 
I met a young NOBO named Boomerang taking a break. He seemed a little preoccupied but friendly. But down at Sawyer Brook in a deep notch I ran across Spurs, Muck Fichigan, and Wild all hanging out. Hopper had again sent me out with leftovers, including lots of day-old pancakes in case I ran across hikers. When I asked if they were interested in food they all looked at me intently. And when I pulled out the pancakes they practically leapt on them. Wild was especially ecstatic over the sausages and potatoes. Seeing how thrilled they were over these simple but unlikely treats helps me understand why trail angels do what they do. 
Wild decided to go back to the hostel with me for the night. Though he seemed very conflicted over cutting back today's miles. He wanted to upload videos to his YouTube channel. He teased though that I'd be to the road way ahead of him. He recreated my departure yesterday at the bottom of Mahoosuc Arm: ""Nice hiking with ya Wild!""... <fist bump>...<cloud of dust>. But as we climbed over Moody Mountain I veered off at a viewpoint and didn't realize he'd snuck past me until I reached the road to find him and Hopper hanging out. Though, once again, it was almost exactly the time I said we'd get there. 
Mills Market again, but this time I grabbed three slices of pizza. Lazy afternoon at the hostel. A big rotisserie chicken family meal. We learned the dinner table was covered with hiker signatures below, including Earl Schaffer's, and added our own. Honey has promised it to the Appalachian Trail Museum.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630927,"A final breakfast feast at The Cabin - omelets, pancakes, bacon, skillet potatoes - courtesy of Hopper. Hopper, by the way, lives in Virginia and comes up for the summer to help Honey run the hostel. She's headed home in another week. She thruhiked years ago, but because she stopped in Andover during her hike to help out Honey and Bear for a few days she had to skip ahead forty miles to rejoin her group. So she refuses to call herself a thruhiker. 
At the South Arm trailhead Wild gave all the leftover pancakes to three SOBOs: Drainage (she drinks her dishwater), a guy named Viggie/Vigorosity, and an unnamed girl. At first they donned masks to approach but once they saw the pancakes they came off.
The day started with a very steep climb up to Old Blue. It dipped then climbed the Bemis range, which has multiple bedrock summits with the now familiar alpine plants. The fall colors continue to spread, with whole hillsides of birch now gleaming yellow, while orange and red maples and oaks dappled the valleys. 
The hiking was usually not difficult. I was able to maintain 2 mph without much effort, even with occasional breaks at views. In the middle of the day a very light rain sprinkled on and off, enough to wet a few trees and, more concerningly, a few rocks. I pulled out my trekking poles in case of a slip. The sun went in and out of the clouds, alternately warming or letting the cold wind have its way.
From Bemis Mountain I could see  Mooselookmeguntic Lake, largest of the Rangeley Lakes District. It spread below to the horizon and beyond, great forking arms running off for many miles, surrounded by painted hills. 
Several times I would see a small snake, always the same black with patterned back. And always it noticed me before I it, and it raced ahead of me until it could find a hole to slither in. I wondered why they were out today, as I'd not seen any before. Perhaps, like the squirrels, they were looking for food before winter sets in. 
A steep climb brought me up to Route 17 where a road turnoff provides a spectacular overlook of the lake. I rested and dug into the pancakes, cantaloupe, and brownies I'd packed out. A woman admiring the view asked me how the hiking was today, assuming I was out for the day. When it came out I'd been hiking since Georgia she was amazed, practically speechless. ""You hiked all the way from Georgia? Good for you! Good for you!"" she repeated 
The last four miles to the shelter were easy. I stopped at a beach on Long Pond and took a bracing dip in the cold water. The air was warmer, though not by much. Still, I can't expect it to get any warmer farther north. I wanted to get at least one swim in Maine.
At the shelter three older guys out for a long weekend were tenting on a platform. In the shelter was a flip-flopper originally from South Boston named Fenway. He started March 17, got off after two weeks, returned in May, and flipped from McAfee Knob. He fell behind his tramily when he injured his ankle. And recently he was hospitalized for a concussion from hitting his head on rocks. After resting a few days in Rangeley he's back on trail. He lives in San Diego these days, and hopes to hike the PCT next year if the AT doesn't kill him first.
Cooked up Ramen and threw in some rotisserie chicken I packed out from yesterday's dinner at the Cabin. Delicious! Not too cold this evening, forecast looks good for the next two or three days.","South Arm Rd

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630928,"Reasonably warm morning. Aside from last week's cold snap the weather has been exceptionally good throughout New Hampshire and Maine. I know it can't last, but I'll enjoy it while it does. 
The flip side of no rain is that many of the streams have run dry and most of the rest are just puddles. Now that I'm cooking again, I have to plan my water carefully before I reach the shelter each evening.
Spurs was tenting at the shelter, though I didn't see him last night. I caught up with him near the campsite at Little Swift River Pond. But there I stopped, because someone had brought canoes up to the pond. I took one out for a spin on the secluded little lake. The shoreline was hemmed in by stately firs and showy maples and oaks, flaming red and orange. The sun moved in and out from behind the clouds. 
Another five miles down to Route 4 were uneventful. A garter snake darted away. I flushed grouse - this usually happens several times a day. There is a sudden thunder of beating wings and a crash through the bushes that at first makes you think a bear or moose is charging you. I've learned not to overreact to their furious flight. One particular grouse, a male judging by the red neck, didn't flee, but stood around watching me and slowly stalking off the trail. Maybe mating season? I've seen groups of wild turkeys near roads recently as well. The males in one group, females in another. 
At the road I walked a quarter mile west to the Hiker Hut, run by Steve and Catherine since 2012. Spurs was there resupplying. They have a hostel which consists of a handful of small cabins but are off the grid - no electricity, no plumbing, no cell service. Many hikers rave about it, and I'm sure it's a relaxing spot in the height of the season. But the couple had just stopped taking overnight guests and were busy insulating the A-frame cabin for winter. Although they offered to put me up, I hesitated and rethought my plan to Nero here, given it had no more amenities than a shelter. Instead I opted to run into town for a late lunch and small resupply then hike out to the next shelter. I waited an hour until Steve was ready to drive into town. He wanted to pick up Thai food for dinner and the place didn't open until 4. He dropped me at a pizza joint and went to the library to use their WiFi. On the way back we stopped briefly at the IGA, the last supermarket on the trail. Along the way I learned Steve has wintered in India for 23 years, once biking 2000 miles across that country. He bought the Maine property as a hermit retreat, but ended up opening the hostel for some extra income and constantly having guests. Ironic karma, he thought.  
He ended up charging me $20 for the trip, which I thought was a bit exorbitant considering I was basically tagging along on his errand. Should have just hitched, or hiked right through. Stopping in town was more psychological than anything. I didn't want to skip Rangeley and head right up Saddleback Mountain. I had a bad history with that mountain and needed to psych myself up.
It was only two miles up to the shelter. Passed two young guys early in their southbound thruhike, not even with trail names yet. I considered going another mile or two up to one of the ponds and tenting. Perhaps I'd see a moose. Steve said they were common around here. But I wanted an easy setup so I spread out in the empty shelter and called it an early night.","Sabbath Day Pond Lean-To

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631037,"Woke up to a loud trilling sound. I figured it was a bird. But later I saw a red squirrel cocking its head and letting out the same sound. I must have gotten twelve hours of sleep regardless. I was lazy and didn't get on trail until after nine. 
In the first mile, as I came to a small bog called Ethel Pond, I saw a cow moose bathing. My first moose! Excitedly I grabbed my camera. As I positioned to get a better view I heard a rustle near the trail to the north. It was a bull moose walking toward me along the edge of the pond, and next to the trail. Crap, what do I do? Stuck between two moose! And it's rutting season! The guidebooks don't tell you what to do in this situation. I moved slowly off trail and bushwhacked uphill a few yards to let the bull pass. He was following the cow.
The cow periodically let out a moo like a squeaky faucet. The bull would respond with a gruff exhalation through his nostrils. The bull watched me for a bit, then followed the cow. She swam around the shoreline and he followed through the water at a distance. They stopped, about forty feet apart, on the far side of the pond for about ten minutes. Maybe they still sensed me or maybe it was part of the mating/courting ritual. Finally the cow walked ahead and the bull followed, this time getting closer, breaking off into the trees, and both were lost from view in the foliage. Spurs later told me he saw both moose in the same area the night before, though separately.
I climbed the Saddleback range in splendid weather. It's as beautiful as Franconia Ridge - more so given the autumn colors. One can see dozens of mountains from the alpine summit, including the next two days' trek as well as non-AT peaks like Abraham, Sugarloaf, and Redington.
It felt hot today for the first time in many days. I shed my fleece early on. I'd chosen pants this morning rather than shorts and regretted it within the hour. Between the warmer weather, direct sun, and numerous climbs I was sweating profusely. It even felt a little humid.
I caught up with Spurs going down into the valley between the Saddleback range and the Sugarloaf range. He had seen the moose last evening before camping at another pond. He was taking it slow and easy, giving himself two more days to get to Stratton. 
3 more garter snakes on trail. I don't remember seeing these before the last several days.
Leaves are now covering the trail below 2500 feet. Makes for slippery footing sometimes. Thankfully it's been dry. Actually, too dry. At Orbeton Stream the Sluice Brook falls are described as roaring but were a mere trickle. There's been no rain in weeks.
I met three guys out for a long weekend heading to the same shelter as me. We were a little over three miles away. Told them I was taking a detour and would get in after dark.
So I climbed the AT up Lone Mountain then took a 1.7 mile (one way) blue blaze to Mt Abraham. I had decided spur-of-the-moment this morning I would hike all 8 of the 4000 footers in this range, even the ones the AT doesn't go near. Saddleback and The Horn on Saddleback were the first two, which the trail goes directly over. Abraham is interesting because it has the second largest alpine zone in Maine, after Katahdin. What that means in practice is it's a big pile of rocks, like Adams or Madison in the Whites. It was slow going and fairly windy, though not so much I had to add layers. The sun sinking low over the Saddlebacks turned the ranges into various shades of blue. A quarter moon hung over the summit.
I tried to hurry back to the AT but encroaching darkness and uneven terrain slowed me down. About a half mile before the shelter I caught up to the three weekenders. They'd gone less than three miles in the time I'd covered six and a half, and they seemed pretty beat. 
One of the hikers had hiked from Springer to Harpers Ferry in 2015. He went by Indy, short for Indecisive, a name you get when you wait too long to accept a name! He wants to try for a full thruhike, he said, as he collapsed on the shelter floor and complained of being out of shape. His buddies are content to section. They all seem like they had a long day. For that matter, my quads and calves really felt it today. So much climbing, and over twenty miles with the off-trail detour. I'll have to check the vertical gain. Tomorrow could be even more.","Piazza Rock Lean-To
",Spaulding Mountain Lean-To,"Sep 26, Sat",16.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631039,"I was up very early, planning to bag the remaining five of the eight 4000 footers in this section. Sugarloaf is a half mile off trail, but today's biggest challenge is Redington, a summit that has no official trail and requires 2.5 miles round-trip of navigation skills.
Very early on a short but steep climb up a side trail brought me to Spaulding's 4000+ foot summit. It was wooded with little view. #4 done!
Sugarloaf is over half a mile and six hundred vertical feet off the AT. The summit (#5!) was covered with antennae, ski lifts, huts, and a helicopter pad. And a huge pile of loose rocks.  But although the mountain itself wasn't much to look at it, Sugarloaf offered incredible views in all directions. Clouds rested in the valleys and fall colors spread everywhere. I could see the Saddlebacks to the southwest, the Crockers and Bigelows to the northeast. Three dayhikers in their sixties arrived having walked up the ski slopes.
Coming down Sugarloaf I felt a warm wind. Not what I expected this late in the season. For a half mile the descent became a steep boulder scramble. Several dayhikers were coming up, there being a dirt road access in the valley.
A southbounder named Abe Lincoln stopped to chat. Didn't get the story but his beard must've inspired the name. Told me he's trying to beat his previous thruhike time of three months. I later learned from other hikers that he has 12,000 miles on his feet and has done the AT two or three times.
I am continually astounded by the magnificent colors. They covered the hillsides and the banks of the Carrabassett River, itself strewn with large boulders. The climb up South Crocker became quite steep, but nothing new for this part of Maine. At the summit (#6!) I found an unmarked and unmaintained ""herd path"" that began a narrow route to Mount Redington. The tread was mostly dirt, better than the AT, but the trees were so close they constantly brushed and grabbed at me. I appreciate better now the value of clearing a proper trail. I thought I'd be alone on this stretch but, it being Saturday, I encountered a trio of girls out peakbagging. They pointed me in the right direction at an opportune time as I reached the saddle between Crocker and Redington. The summit (#7!) was wooded, like the Crockers, with only a limited view. But a 4000-footer is a 4000-footer! This side trip alone added over 1200 feet of vertical gain to the day.
Back on South Crocker I headed north. I rested going up North Crocker. My ankles and calves were exhausted from the constant climbs. I heard some coos or chirps nearby, and watched as four guinea hens or maybe grouse emerged onto the trail and pecked around for several minutes, mere feet from me. 
I passed the girls again as they left North Crocker on the way back to their car. Despite North Crocker being almost as high as Sugarloaf, it had no view. But I was now 8 for 8 with 4000 footers. As I descended I passed three young boys hiking up to North Crocker, their parents trailing well behind.
And just a minute later I crossed the 2000 mile mark. Someone had spelled out the number with stones. Over 90% done. Less than 200 miles to go. It hardly seems real. The enormity of it hasn't hit me yet. The last few miles went quickly, comparatively, over leafy if rooty and rocky downhill. 
Justin from The Hostel of Maine picked me up at the road. We onboarded four more hikers at the hostel and went to the Sugarloaf ski resort to do laundry and eat large burgers. They are open in the summer to serve hikers and mountain bikers.
Two of the hostel hikers, Equilibrium and  Donald, are young guys sectioning Maine. They were arranging transportation to end their hike a couple days early to avoid forecasted rain. Freight Train is a young flip-flopper who has hiked from NJ to Vermont and from Katahdin south and plans to finish this year.
Spruce (Bruce) is a retired electrical worker from West Virginia who is hiking Maine southbound. He hiked the southern half of the AT last fall and early this year. All four guys slackpacked the Bigelows together yesterday.
Justin and his wife own and run the Hostel of Maine. It is immaculately clean, like a high-end ski lodge. They have a new baby so we didn't see much of them in the evening!
It was another tiring day. The official milage doesn't do it justice. In addition to four bonus miles, the day was filled with steep climbs and descents. I appreciated the soft bed and I could easily have zeroed. But I have a deadline. The Kennebec ferry stops running on September 30th. If I don't want to wade across or charter a private ferry I need to hike the next two days.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-To
",Route 27 (Stratton),"Sep 27, Sun",13.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631041,"Justin drove Spruce and me back to trail at 9, stopping for breakfast sandwiches at the market. Freight Train was headed out later, while Equilibrium and Donald were headed home.
At the trailhead trail angels Gracie and Christie were out enjoying the autumn leaves. They wanted to meet us and take our pictures, and offered us water bottles. Spruce headed south and I crossed the road to enter the Bigelow range.
It was another scorcher today. Well, relative to a Maine autumn. I felt low on energy despite a good rest and plenty of calories. 
As I paused on trail I heard some creaking. I looked up to see a tall dead fir trunk leaning against another tree looking and sounding like it was going to fall any moment! I scurried ahead fifty yards to be clear of any misfortune.
Saw few other hikers today. One, an older woman named JJ, was hiking southbound from Abol Bridge for six weeks. She started in Georgia in March but got off and is now sectioning. Her kids worry about her - wear strong boots, Mom! Bring the right stove! She's looking forward to holing up in Stratton during the rain. Everyone seems to think a great flood is coming. 
It was a 2000 foot climb up to the Bigelow ridgeline, and that was before another 800 or so to the first of several summits. It's the largest climb left until Katahdin by far. The elevation profile looks positively tame in between. West Bigelow and Avery Peak are two more 4000 footers in my collection now. That makes 10 of Maine's 14. Three of the remaining summits are in Baxter State Park, two on Katahdin itself. The 14th is Old Speck, which the AT climbs but does not cross the summit. I passed over that side trail when I was in a hurry to reach Grafton Notch. I regret ""saving"" that twenty minutes now. It will take four hours to bag the peak on its own.
The Bigelow ridge is stunning in good weather. Flagstaff Lake (the dammed Dead River) stretches some thirty miles along one side and endless orange, yellow, and red forest covers the valley to the south. The ridge itself is stark, rocky and austere, again rivaling Franconia Ridge. It gets far less traffic, but is still quite popular in the summer. The wind roared on the southern side but was subdued, even calm, a few feet to the north. I sat for a long time eating lunch on one of the summits, looking over Flagstaff Lake.
My gear continues to wear and tear. My water bottle cap snapped yesterday, and the bottom third of one of my trekking poles disappeared. It was strapped to my pack but the bottom clip came open, allowing the tube to slide out. It may have been opened by a branch when I was bushwhacking to Redington. 
I caught up with a northbounder named Dutchman who started in Maryland. A Georgia native, he just earned a PhD in Physics, specifically quantum computing, from the University of Maryland. He was looking for a Hiker named Red Beard who was new to me.
Some weather was moving in and the clouds descended. I climbed over Little Bigelow ridge inside a cloud. Mist wet the rocks making for tricky footing. Dusk fell into darkness. Where had the day gone? The ridge bumped up and down constantly - what I ironically call ""Maine Easy"" terrain. There followed a slick descent over bare bedrock, roots and rocks with a headlamp that couldn't pierce more than a few feet into the fog. Dutchman followed, having given up on seeing his friend today. We finally made it to the shelter well after dark, having only done fifteen miles. Shows what dragging my feet will do.","Route 27 (Stratton)
",Little Bigelow Lean-To,"Sep 28, Mon",15.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631045,"Today's goal was to get close to Pierce Pond, where there's a fishing camp that offers a big breakfast for the next morning. That in turn is only a few miles to the Kennebec River. The ferry across this supposedly dangerous-to-ford river stops running tomorrow. I'll be coming in just under the wire.
The terrain around the eastern end of Flagstaff Lake was easy but I was not feeling particularly energetic. Any climb, even the smallest, was tiring. I've experienced this before, also in Maine after finishing days of tough hiking. I probably need a day off.
I filtered water at a slow moving stream. Leaves fell around me in batches when the breeze picked up. Leaves have been covering the trail, causing a slight hazard as they conceal rocks underneath. It forces me to be more careful placing each step.
I plugged in an audiobook and cruised slowly over a long hill. Caught up with Dutchman just as he was getting up from a slip with some choice words. He seems to be giving the trail a piece of his mind whenever I find him. 
On West Carry Pond I followed a rough bushwhack out to Arnold's Point. Didn't look like more than a handful of people had tried it recently. Took a dip in the cool, rock-bottomed water on the way back and dried out in the breezy sun.
The trail for the next couple of miles followed Benedict Arnold's portage path when his brigade launched an attack on British Quebec during the Revolution. It then wound around Middle and East Carry Ponds before shooting north to Pierce Pond. 
Other than Dutchman I saw only an old dayhiker and his dog. 
At Pierce Pond Lean-To I dropped my pack and took another swim while the sun was still out. Two fishing boats tooled by, having no luck. It was nearly five and the sun was low. I followed a quarter-mile blue blaze from the shelter to Harrison's fishing camp, where I found Dutchman. Tim Harrison has been running the camp for over forty years. He is very generous to hikers. He gave us lemonade while we chatted and looked through the old hiker logs. I found my entry from 2017. Tim lives here year-round. The temperature often doesn't get above 20 below for long stretches in the winter and the road is only kept open thanks to a logging company's operations. He told us how Maine's governor back in March had ordered fishing and hunting camps to close until June. Unfortunately May is the height of their season - the ice has melted but the water is still cold - and most of the camps couldn't survive that loss. The owners came up with a reopening plan, but the governor ignored it, he said. So most of the camps stayed closed and some will go out of business. Tim decided to reopen anyway, and the anglers came. 
Tim offers hikers a 12-pancake breakfast, which we eagerly signed up for tomorrow. From here it'll be a short three miles to the Kennebec River to catch the ferry. 
Back in the shelter, Dutchman and I spied two mice scurrying around. Dutchman decided the best defense is a good offense. He lugged in a large rock, baited a leaf with peanut butter, waited for a mouse to come out from under the sleeping platform, and crushed it. Cleaned it up, then it was the second mouse's turn. I guess it hadn't learned anything from its friends demise. Dutchman, the physics PhD, got philosophical and turned to me and asked if I knew what Robert Oppenheimer had said when the first atomic bomb was tested. Wondering how this was related, I replied without missing a beat ""We sure could kill a lot of mice with this thing!"" Which cracked us both up much more than it should have. (For the record Oppenheimer quoted ""I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"" from the Bhagavita.)
The rain started as dusk turned to dark, pattering away on the metal roof. Good timing.","Little Bigelow Lean-To
",Pierce Pond Lean-To,"Sep 29, Tue",17.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631048,"Dutchman and I were up early to hike the short distance to Harrison's camp in a light rain. It had come in waves through the night, and sounded more intimidating inside the shelter than out. We feared fording the brook that feeds Pierce Pond might be tough with the rising waters, but it was easy enough to rock hop across. 
At Harrison's we mingled with a half dozen fisherman guests and dug into a huge breakfast. A baker's dozen pancakes stuffed with apples, blueberries, and raspberries, Maine maple syrup, eggs, sausage, juice, and coffee. I polished it off without much effort. I am no longer surprised at my apparently bottomless appetite. Dutchman struggled for a time, but eventually finished. In fact I stepped away for a few minutes and returned to find him finishing off someone else's leftovers. 
I explored the lodge's great room, with a live edge Parcheesi board, a pool table, a moose head, big leather chairs, and scores of old books. A thick history of Pierce Pond - a nearly uninhabited area?  A huge two volume collection of AT thruhiker narratives - from 1975, when it was hardly a household name. I could have sat around all day and a week perusing Tim's treasures, but I had a ferry to catch. But before stepping out I studied a newspaper he'd saved from two years ago. They'd found the body of a woman who'd become lost on the trail several years earlier. It had happened in the area I'd been three days ago, north of Saddleback. She had been found near a stream that, had she followed it a quarter mile downstream, would have led to a larger stream and then across the trail. It is possible to lose the trail if you wander from it in dense vegetation, but any hiker should know how to stay found, carry the right navigation tools, and know how to use dead reckoning to regain their position. Failing that, they should hike with someone who does. 
Dutchman and I hiked slowly through rain and over wet rocks, roots, and leaves along the brook for over three miles. The rain turned into a downpour for ten or twenty minutes, removing any hope of staying partially dry. Near the end the trail climbed and dropped steeply on a slippery dirt track over a hill and led us to the confluence with the Kennebec River. 
After a few minutes the ferryman on the far side noticed us and paddled over. Greg was friendly and had us sign the usual waivers before giving Dutchman an oar and sitting us in his three-man canoe. The transit took all of three or four minutes to cross the 400 foot wide river. Upstream it looked shallow enough to ford without wetting your kneecaps. I decided I'd worried myself too much over possibly missing the ferry. 
On the way to the road we hauled out a bag of trash from a riverside campsite. In the village of Caratunk I asked at the forest service shed if I could dispose of it. The ranger thanked me, and asked where we'd found this bag full of beer cans and the like. It seemed clear it was not left by hikers. 
Eric from The Sterling Inn picked us up by the post office. At his hostel / B&B we found Red Beard, who had crossed after us but then walked down to the inn while we'd waited in town. Red Beard is a Southern boy, history buff, and HVAC guy by training who now lives out of an RV and moves around where he pleases taking odd jobs. He is flip-flopping, having started in Harpers Ferry. 
The Sterling Inn is a well-maintained, clean, and comfortable old home with all the comforts a hiker could want. Eric's son shuttled us out in the evening for dinner and snacks. Between the extra calories and low miles today I hope to regain my energy for the leg to Monson starting tomorrow.","Pierce Pond Lean-To
",US 201 (Caratunk),"Sep 30, Wed",4
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631175,"In the Sterling Inn bunkroom I was last to bed and first up this morning. Hard to sleep once daylight hits. I puttered around the inn attending to correspondence, organizing cub scout events for back home, updating my journal, posting pictures, and enjoying a leisurely breakfast of yogurt, fruit, and juice thanks to Eric of the Sterling Inn.
Yesterday I had what will probably be my last zoom call with the family before I summit Katahdin. I was excited to show them the videos of my moose encounter. They all seem well, but I know they miss me. I certainly miss them. Not much longer til I see them again.
I also got to talk with my parents. My dad and brother surprised me by offering to drive up from Pennsylvania to bring me home. It's a very long way and it's certainly not necessary to put them out - I've gotten home from Katahdin before. But it reminds me of the trip the three of us took to Maine when I was just nine. We camped and hiked along the coast and Acadia. The memory of standing atop a mountain, seeing the world laid out as if painted on a canvas, is seared in my mind. While I didn't appreciate it enough at the time, that trip likely contributed much to my love of hiking and the outdoors. And I never did properly thank my dad for taking us. So in a way this brings us full circle. 
Eventually I got my act together, packed up, and said goodbye to Red Beard and Dutchman. They were glorying in their deliberative pace, taking a zero today and likely another tomorrow due to a forecast of rain. Too many hikers are in a hurry they argued, don't even stop at the viewpoints. Very true, I agreed. I'm certainly guilty of skipping overlooks or blue blazes when I'm on a mission or feeling tired. Then again I sometimes go miles out of my way to climb 4000 footers or see a waterfall, or stop to take a swim, gaze at the horizon, identify wildflowers, or observe wildlife. I think I've been pretty good about smelling the roses on this hike. I just spend more hours on trail and hike faster between stops. 
Red Beard is also a bit proud of the prodigious weight of his pack. He knows he could easily save 5 pounds by casting off unnecessary items, but says he wouldn't notice the difference. Though he's made some concessions to weight: he showed me a full-size wooden hairbrush he carries to keep his long hair and beard from becoming dreadlocks - a brush he cut the handle off to save a few ounces. 
Eric's son dropped me back at the trailhead at 11:30, though he wasn't much for conversation on the way. This 37 mile section to Monson is supposed to be easy, with only two mountains and mostly level terrain. But it reminds me of why I came up with the term ""Maine easy"". Level doesn't mean smooth. It means roots, rocks, frequents small climbs and descents and, at this time of year, a deep covering of leaves to make you guess what you're stepping on. There are also a large number of fallen branches and trees - more than I've seen since New York. My pace was constrained by this difficult and sometimes slippery footing. 
The climb up Pleasant Pond Mountain was satisfying. If I'm going to work hard for each step let me at least get a view. And a gorgeous view it was, with mountains in the distance in every direction. In the middle ground were endless forests speckled by ponds and lakes with occasional hilltops. And all richly colored with pinkish hues.
Two women were summiting with me. They'd been shuttled to Caratunk and were hiking several days back to Monson. One then asked what I was up to - dayhiking? Heh, if I had a nickel for every time I've been mistaken for a dayhiker! But when they learned I'd come from Georgia they had lots of questions. I was happy to oblige, I like talking about my hike and helping others envision what it's like. In any case I saw no other hikers today and this was my social time.
She asked me what had been my worst day on trail. I paused, then said I tried to see the positive side each day. On the spot to come up with an answer I noted walking through Hurricane Isaiah back in Pennsylvania was rough. But afterwards, on further reflection, I realized my worst moments were when I felt truly alone. When my son flew home from Georgia, and I was driving back to Helen from the airport realizing that for the rest of the long hike ahead I was on my own. And when Sara picked up our daughter at Bake Oven Knob and I watched them drive off from the gravel lot, the miles ahead again seemed vast and cold. And the evening in Vermont when I hiked past happy groups camping by a lake only to reach a shelter that was way off trail, out of water, and empty. Just being alone doesn't make you lonely, but a long solo journey will have its lonely moments.
On the way down the trail passed under a huge cantilevered boulder. A narrow passage led through a crack in the supporting boulder. The trail went around, but I was tempted and tried the passage. It put New York's famous Lemon Squeezer and Virginia's Fat Man Squeeze to shame. It required shimmying up a fourteen inch gap at an angle to a higher plane, then scurrying sideways to the end. But it got my blood pumping.
The rest of the afternoon was undemanding. An occasional pond - which are always beautiful - some bogs, streams, lots of fall color, a climb over Moxie Bald with a lot of bedrock, a golden-red sky near sunset with row upon row of blue-tinted mountains. A scramble down the mountain in the gathering dusk by the light of my cell phone. 
At the shelter by Moxie Bald Mountain Pond I dropped my pack, walked to the shore, and stared agog at the full moon, ablaze in orange, rising above the pond. A loon wailed off in the distance, the call echoing over the lake. A moose (most likely) grunted from some dark unseen shore. I was truly in the wilderness here. Not a hint of traffic or neighbors or city lights or even another human being. Between the loon calls it was near silence, just the occasional splash of a trout or frog.
In the shelter I had company - two adorable little mice. I have a soft spot in my heart for mice, having raised a horde of them in college (long story). But they were highly active critters and very bold. Exploring my pack and scurrying around the sleeping platform checking out my food bag while I was preparing dinner. I grabbed a trekking pole and swatted at one to scare him off, but accidentally hit and seriously injured him. He was down and twitching horribly. I had to finish him off. It was the only humane thing to do. I felt terrible. I had come out to live at peace with nature and here I was taking a little life. I know many hikers would cheer me ridding the shelter of a mouse, but I'd rather just deny them food and encourage them to return to natural habits. Perhaps that is just naive. The surviving mouse continued to boldly explore but, after finding nothing in my pack pockets and after hanging my food out of his reach, he seems to have retired for now. Thwacking the floor with my pole may have had something to do with it too.
Tomorrow it's a supposedly easy 18 more miles to Monson, the last town before Katahdin. I'm expecting rain, but hoping it's intermittent. I'm looking forward to the hike nonetheless.","US 201 (Caratunk)
",Moxie Bald Mountain Lean-To,"Oct 01, Thu",18.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631176,"Early in the morning I heard footsteps approaching the shelter. Expecting to see an early-bird hiker coming in for water I peeked my head out from under the quilt. But it wasn't a hiker - it was a bull moose! He was slowly treading past the firepit, just five yards from my feet. He didn't acknowledge my presence, and was gone before I could recover from shock and grab my camera. I could hardly have been more surprised if a T-Rex had walked by.
A light rain started tapping on the shelter roof around 7:30. I headed out an hour later, stopping to gaze over the pond first on the chance I might see the moose again.  
The trail was more Maine Easy, meaning it had no large, steep, technical climbs. But I still had to work for almost every step. There are no gimme miles in Maine. Roots, rocks, twists and turns, small ups and downs. And everything covered in leaves. Oh, and everything thoroughly wet. One rash step and my leg would slide out from underneath me. This is terrain where two trekking poles would have come in handy, but I have only one now.
I passed only one other hiker, a thirtyish bearded southbounder who looked ultralight. Strange to be seeing hikers starting out this late in the year. No dayhikers in this stretch.
I had to ford the Piscataquis River and its branches three times, soaking my shoes. Thanks to multiple footpaths I went the wrong way after one crossing. The rain, which ebbed in and out through the morning, gained strength and became steady in the afternoon. The temperature dropped. I felt a chill that was only held at bay by continued hiking. The cold and wet began to wear on me and my mood soured. I just wanted to reach Monson now. 
I called from the last hill to arrange a pickup from Shaw's hostel. Other than there I haven't had service since the Bigelows, and I wouldn't have service at the road or in Monson. I reached route 15 and stood under a tree in the hiker parking lot as the rain intensified, trying to keep warm. The rain was as strong as ever. My rainjacket had long ago wet through, my pants were wet, and my body was starting to chill. My fingers were too numb to work the clasps on my backpack. 
Captain, an AT hiker turned hostel helper, arrived from Shaw's hostel to give me a thankfully heated ride in. First order of business was a hot shower, then some hot food - a grilled reuben, haddock chowder, and hot tea. I felt my body temperature normalize.
There are more hikers here than I've seen anywhere else. By a lot. But apparently I just missed a bubble that set out yesterday. Of the 15 or 20 hikers milling about most have been here a day or two or more and have been slackpacking into the 100 Mile Wilderness. Two even shuttled back from Abol Bridge at the far end of the Wilderness because all the camping in Baxter State Park is full. A bubble of thruhikers is finishing in the next day or two and taking all the spaces in the Birches, Baxter's thruhiker shelter.
Among the many hikers here is Barefoot, who I met between Hot Springs and Erwin 1700 miles ago. He now goes by Snorlax, a Pokemon character, due to his habit of taking naps right on the trail. Also here is Water Queen, who I last saw near Woods Hole hostel south of Pearisburg, Virginia. Having followed each other's hikes on Instagram for the last three months we feel like old pals.
A few of the other names I caught were Crunch, Tarzan, Sunset, and Colonel Clothesline but I missed many others.
Two long-haired, clean-shaven section hikers coming off their hike picked up guitars and played duets of country songs while we all caught up. This is the social scene that I've been missing for 2000 miles. Grateful to get a little taste, even if it's near the end.","Moxie Bald Mountain Lean-To

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631183,"Woke several times in the early morning. We had a few snorers in the bunkroom but that wasn't it. I couldn't decide whether to hike today or zero as planned. My body said zero. Laying there I could feel my tired limbs and sore feet. Plus the recent memory of being wet and cold made me not want to leave the warm bed.
But by the time breakfast was on the table and my muscles had warmed up I was ready to commit to a slackpack. It would be the first fifteen miles of the 100 Mile Wilderness, and I'd be going southbound due to the shuttle arrangements. At first I resisted the idea of flipping direction even for a short leg. My hike isn't purist, but I am following the principle of ""continuous footsteps"". But after a few minutes reflection I decided the only one who cares which direction I hike is me, and I was just throwing up artificial constraints. This hike will let me put miles on the board on a day I'd otherwise have zeroed, and split the cost of a shuttle with other slackpackers.
Water Queen and 5-Oh, a South Carolina boy, joined me in the shuttle. They are slackpacking north the second fifteen miles, having done my slack yesterday. We walked a nearly one mile long side trail from the parking lot to reach the AT, gaining a few hundred feet. This is the foot of Barren Mountain, part of the Chairback Range.
The trail went up and down over low but steep ledges, similar to New York, with several waterfalls and creek fords. Plus a lot more roots, rocks, and mud. The ledges are bedrock ridges turned 90 degrees making for some interesting descents.
The Little Wilson Falls cascades over an Escher-like series of square-edged ledges into a narrow bedrock canyon. These waterfalls are the first I've seen in many weeks with any flow.
Ran across thruhikers Colonel Clothesline and Sunset with friend Joanna having lunch by Mud Pond. They opted to hike into the Wilderness with full packs, though they may be getting a food drop halfway through. Also saw Cowboy, a sixtyish leathery guy carefully toeing down slick rocks toward the first shelter. And two small groups of backpackers doing the Wilderness, in various stages of struggle with the difficult terrain.
When I got back to the road to Monson I had some time before my shuttle came, so I tried to dry my socks in the sun to little effect. Two days of fording rivers gave them no time to dry.
Back at the hostel Snorlax and I hit the gas station for a hot lunch - yes, the gas station. It's the best quick order restaurant in town. 
Spurs, Wild, and Muck Fichigan piled into the hostel in late afternoon, surprising me since I thought they were just coming out of Caratunk today. But it was great to see familiar faces. Muck discovered he'd left his wallet behind at the Sterling Inn. Fortunately the owner Eric, whose son serves as Caratunk's postmaster, had already mailed it ahead to Shaw's.
We tried to get a table at the Pub, but they were full on a Saturday evening. So I ordered a pizza from the gas station. It had been nearly two hours since I last ate! I gave Muck half of it since he had no money to buy dinner.
5-Oh and Water Queen came in late and exhausted from slacking the Chairbacks. Must have been pretty brutal to dim Water Queen's usual ebullient mood.","Route 15 (Monson)
",Otter Pond,"Oct 03, Sat",15.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631191,"For the second day in a row I woke up thinking I would zero and ended up doing a slackpack. This time it was over the Chairback range.
Poet made sure we all had plenty of calories to start the day. All-you-can-eat blueberry pancakes plus eggs, skillet potatoes and bacon. To Poet and his wife Hippie Chick it's a quiet day, but to me having a dozen hikers around is a big and exciting event.
We left in a light rain. I shuttled out with Snorlax, who would be slacking the section I did yesterday. We talked about boy scouting as we headed up the connector trail to the AT. Snorlax is an eagle scout from Kansas City. I headed north up Barren Mountain while he headed south.
I shortly overtook a trio of dayhikers. Trail Snail is visiting the trail on her 60th birthday for the first time since her 1996 thruhike. She was joined by a friend with her 14-year-old son. The two wanted to hike the Wilderness this year but were unfortunately deterred by warnings from Baxter and the ATC. But they'll be out next season.
A thruhiker named Mighty Bones hiked down at the same time. He's on the flip side of a flip-flop hiking south to Maryland. He nearly died in a car accident two years ago and has had numerous surgeries and prosthetics to repair his arms, knees, and face. An amazing and inspiring story of overcoming adversity. Once again I'm reminded that whatever discomforts or privations I suffer out here it pales beside what others have gone through.
I had a gorgeous view from Barren Slide of cotton ball clouds drifting over Lake Onawa and the multi-colored valley. There are seven climbs in the Chairbacks: Barren Ledges, Barren Mountain, Fourth Mountain, Mount Three and a Half (unofficial), Third Mountain, Columbus Mountain, and Chairback Mountain. In between are bogs and streams. None of the climbs were outrageous, but everything was damp and slick. The trail was often muddy or flooded. Overall slow going, and I took my time to avoid any falls. I still slipped many times. Fortunately all were partially controlled - like when both feet straddled a boulder, starting slipping apart, and I nearly did a split.
I had plenty of time to reach my pickup point so I did some wildlife watching along the way. Plenty of red squirrels chattering and hoarding nuts. A pileated woodpecker flying between trees and making some interesting sounds. Fresh moose tracks in the mud. Bear clawings in a dead tree looking for insects.
I sauntered down the last stretch to Katahdin Ironworks Road near 5:30 where Mike was already waiting. He had two more hikers who had opportunistically come upon the truck and decided to head back to Shaw's. We waited a half hour for Water Queen and 5-Oh to finish the slackpack just north of here, another fifteen miles over Whitecap Mountain, who came in with freshly soaked shoes from fording the Pleasant River. It took an hour to get back to Monson and we hit the gas station for dinner. Already a long day, I hit the sack early. Tomorrow will definitely be a zero.","Otter Pond

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631192,"Zero-ed at Shaw's after two days of slackpacking. Rough life! Should be four more days to reach the foot of Katahdin, a day to summit, and a day for insurance, which I'll use to climb the last 4000-footer in Maine if I don't need it. Six days of food is more than I've carried at any point on this thruhike. With a frameless pack I'm expecting to feel it for the first day or two.
Another huge breakfast - I'm frontloading calories for the next week! Resupplied when I got to tag along with Hippie Chick to the grocery store in Greenville 15 miles away. Picked up a bottle of champagne to celebrate early with the hikers here. I'm not carrying it to Katahdin, that's for sure. 
Kitchen Sink, who zeroed the last two days, got a replacement backpack and spent the afternoon sorting through his gear, shipping some stuff home, and repacking. He's southbound and is early in his journey, however far it may take him. Snorlax also zeroed, while Muck, Spurs, and Wild slacked and Water Queen and 5-Oh headed back on trail. A flip-flopper named Fossil who I met in the Mahoosucs showed up last night and slacked the section south of Monson today. 
A girl helping out here has been doing work-for-stay for a few weeks. She hiked a little but plans to thruhike next year. Poet dubbed her Jabberwocky - as in the trail is her Jabberwocky to slay. Poet, a former high school teacher, can recite that and many other works from various authors from memory.
A foursome popped in last night from the middle of the Wilderness just for the night and to resupply - Shark Boy, Lava Girl, Bear Claw, and one I forget. And this afternoon Red Beard and Dutchman made it from Caratunk after zeroing two days at the Sterling Inn. Several section hikers also came through. Shaw's is the epicenter for hikers in northern Maine, and something of a vortex. It's almost impossible to stay less than two or three nights. 
Hippie Chick whipped up dinner for everyone because it's Monday - lasagna and plenty of it! I popped the champagne, which on top of some wine and mulled cider made everyone merrier than usual. 
Tomorrow, I hike. On into the Wilderness! On to Katahdin! The Long Cruise nears its end.","Katahdin Ironworks Road

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631278,"Everyone in the hostel is leaving today. Snorlax, Muck, Spurs, and Wild are all headed to Otter Pond to start up the Chairbacks. Fossil is headed south. Dutchman and Red Beard are headed into the Wilderness from town, without even taking a zero. Two women who finished their section are headed home. 5-Oh and Water Queen left yesterday, and the foursome of Shark Boy, Lava Girl, etc were shuttled back yesterday as well. Merik, who was born in Slovakia, and his girlfriend, who is hiking to New York, joined me on the shuttle to Katahdin Ironworks Road. They had come in yesterday from there for a night in the hostel. 
Poet shuttled us out. He and Hippie Chick have run Shaw's for six years or so. Before thruhiking they were both high school teachers, and bought the place when the previous owner, a woman who still lives on the block, wanted to retire. Business this year has been off about a third, but has been better than expected. They opened in June and have had no real issues. Their biggest challenge, as for many hostel owners, is finding reliable staff to lessen the burden during the hiking season so they can take a day or two off from time to time. It's a 24/7 job for five months a year. Later this month they'll close up and head down to Florida with their two young children where they've been slowly developing a small homestead near Ocala. 
Poet left me with a little haiku which he penned in my souvenir AT passport:
Drink your deepest now,For the richest stuffSettles in the final swig.
In other words, enjoy these last few days on trail.
Shortly into the day I forded the Pleasant River. I greeted Sunset, Colonel Clothesline and their friend Joanna again, who were already across, then searched fruitlessly for a way to rock hop. Finally I gave up and doffed my shoes and socks and waded across. The water was bracingly cold. It was worth it to keep my shoes dry, as tomorrow will bring rain and Thursday will be freezing. 
Shortly after fording I turned off the AT to take a six mile loop along Gulf Hagas, a granite gorge carved by the Pleasant River with multiple waterfalls and dramatic chasms. It's a national natural landmark and billed as the Grand Canyon of Maine. The Rim Trail out was rough and I was constantly taking spur trails down to the edge of the gorge for views, which were quite dramatic with sheer cliffs and a river squeezing through the narrow gap. The views had names like Screw Auger Falls, Hammond Street Pitch, The Jaws, Buttermilk Falls, Billings Falls, and Stair Falls. Even in a relatively dry season the falls are beautiful and the cliffs imposing. This is one of those places I'd return to with the kids.
The tote road back to the AT was much smoother. I'd passed a handful of dayhikers on the Rim Trail but saw almost no one the rest of the day. I passed two small groups of tenters who were already set up for tonight. And a girl backpacking who alerted me that someone had seen a moose up ahead. I saw plenty of fresh scat and some moose-friendly, boggy terrain but no actual moose. They're out there though. You can tell when you're in their backyard.
I climbed over the four peaks of the Whitecap range. This included the last 3000-footer until Katahdin. Unfortunately the peaks were fogged in so I couldn't get a view of the mother mountain in the distance. The climbs were steep but not overly long, and in many places a lot of work had been put in to build stone staircases. I'm used to the climbs now, I almost prefer them to flat terrain because at least all that work is to some purpose. This range didn't seem any easier than the Chairbacks, despite what everyone says. It may have had something to do with me carrying all my gear and six days of food versus slackpacking the Chairbacks.
Had to pull out the headlamp as light faded quickly after six o'clock, with a mile and a half still to go - steeply downhill over slick rocks and roots - to the shelter. One of the nice aspects of the Wilderness is how shelters tend to be right on trail. My first indication the shelter was near was seeing it loom into my headlamp beam. 
Two mice were scurrying around the platform as I arrived. They were the only occupants. They boldly investigated my Fritos bag as I cooked potatoes, salmon, and tea, despite my attempts to deter them with non-lethal force.
The temperature dropped quickly this evening as the sun went down. There were even snow flurries as I descended Whitecap. I expect it'll be in the thirties tonight.","Katahdin Ironworks Road
",Logan Brook Lean-To,"Oct 06, Tue",13.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631280,"It rained overnight, but stopped before dawn. Supposed to rain throughout the day. I discovered one of the mice had chewed into my toilet paper baggie, which I keep in the outside pocket of my pack, and moved some strips inside the pack as if creating a nest. Grrr! The toilet paper has no scent, so why did the mice get into it? I'll have to stow it with my food next time. These shelters in northern Maine all have serious mouse infestations. Which is no surprise - I see slovenly backpackers have left trash and food scraps at every one. I am beginning to rethink my aversion to declaring war on the mice.
Slippery leaves made for slow going downhill to Logan Brook Rd, one of the many points Shaw's shuttles to. The tread didn't improve once the trail leveled out. In fact the leaf bed thickened, hiding roots and rocks. Peak autumn is now passed and the trees are rapidly shedding their loads. Even worse, I was continually avoiding deadfall branches. I stopped often to remove several dozen large branches to the side. This low elevation forest trail is the worst. I've noticed that deadfall has littered all of the low-lying forest sections since Caratunk. Some of it is fairly recent, but much of it looks a year old or more. Often whole trees or branches far too large to move blocked the trail and I had to bushwhack around. But even the smaller branches are tripping hazards. I tend to catch them between my feet and trip myself. Especially if I'm also twisting to avoid slippery roots and rocks. I was able to maintain a faster pace, close to 2.5 mph, but the extra effort to avoid slips and falls was tiring. 
At East Branch Lean-To I rested, and watched a chipmunk run about, approaching me closely, running between my legs. He wouldn't pose, as he darted in circles around the shelter in seemingly random fashion. 
I passed only a lone backpacker all day. He greeted me with ""You're the only person I've seen all day!"" But that was all I could get out of him.
The sun teased me in the late morning as I wondered if the rain would come again. It felt almost warm, or at least not cold. Around noon I reached a sandy beach on Crawford Pond and stripped down to take a dip in the clear but frosty waters. The bottom was sandy well out from shore and would make for a relaxing summer afternoon. In October, it's good for a quick bath and cool down. The wind remained calm, allowing me to air dry in comfort. The pond (lake, really) was tranquil with a barely rippling surface and silent golden forests lining the shores. I conjectured there wasn't another human for at least two miles in any direction, and possibly far more.
I stopped by Cooper Brook Lean-To to check the log entries. What I found in addition was a lot of trash. Someone had hung a plastic bag full of trash from a rafter, and two peanut butter jars, one of them full, lay in the dirt under the platform. I gathered up everything I could find, including trash from the fire ring (if it's not paper, it probably won't burn entirely so pack it out). I hauled the bag out with me.
It started raining again in the early afternoon. A light but steady rain. The kind that gradually soaks everything and ruthlessly erodes your morale. My earbuds started acting up again. Between that, my pack weight, the trash bag, the rain, the deadfall, and the slippery terrain I could feel my mood souring. 
I reached Jo-Mary Road, a major shuttle and resupply point for many hikers. Some of the folks behind me will be getting food drops here and possibly returning to Shaw's for a night. I've had no cell service so couldn't arrange a pickup even if I wanted it. My pack still has five days of food and I've been feeling it. I had to rearrange how I pack it to lower the position of the food bag closer to my center of gravity. Keeping it at the top of my pack made it top heavy and put too much strain on my shoulders. 
I left the trash bag by the road with a note. I knew Shaw's would be by in the next 24 hours and could truck it out. Animals may get to it, but they could have reached it at the shelter too. 
My original goal was Antlers Campsite on Jo-Mary Lake, a scenic and popular spot and a reasonable twenty mile day. But the rain wasn't letting up. I had no desire to put up my tent in the rain and pack up a wet tent tomorrow. When I arrived at 5 pm I saw two tents back in the trees, and the pine forest provided fairly good cover. But since I had daylight I moved on, seeing no point in staying by a lake in lousy weather. No sunset or sunrise would be seen. And tonight is supposed to fall to freezing so I prefer to stay dry. 
Three and half miles later and just at sunset (if the sun had been out) I reached the empty Potaywadjo Spring Lean-To. The water source is an artesian spring that hikers compare to the nectar of the gods. It's good alright. Though it's just a clear pool to dip in, no flow. It was still raining, and the rain strengthened for a few minutes after I settled in, making me content with my decision not to tent back at Antlers. 
Two mice are resident here, though they largely stayed clear of me. Some thoughtless backpacker had left snack foods on one side of the shelter, including a tiny wax-wrapped wheel of cheese. The mice were greedily removing it from the wax, and cooperated in dragging it across the floor and down through a crack underneath the shelter. Well, at least they'll be fat and happy, and hopefully too full to come exploring for my food.
This is the two-thirds mark in the 100 Mile Wilderness. Two more days should bring me to the base of Katahdin.","Logan Brook Lean-To
",Potaywadjo Spring Lean-To,"Oct 07, Wed",23.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631281,"I woke around 4 and couldn't sleep for a time. The mice were scratching away at the Clif bar and cheese on the other side of the shelter. Eventually I dozed off and didn't wake until quarter of eight. Almost 11 hours of sleep! I probably needed it. It was chilly and windy, but not nearly freezing as the forecast had threatened. The worst part was pulling on yesterday's wet, and now cold and wet, socks. I grabbed water from the artesian spring on the way out. The pool was covered with leaves but crystal clear. It looked a bit unearthly, even mythical, like a place Narcissus would sit by to stare at his reflection.
A quarter mile down the trail I came to a dirt logging road. Normally these are deserted and not noteworthy in any way. But as I approached I saw a truck through the trees, and thought perhaps I'd lucked out to find Shaw's dropping off some hikers. Well, it was even better than that. It was trail magic!
Pat and Mike Holt, brothers and retired locals, had set up a table and were making hot coffee and, impressively, fresh donuts by deep frying them in a cast iron skillet - Fastnacht style. They had just arrived and I was customer number one. They did this a couple of years ago, and had no idea if they'd get any hikers today, so they seemed as thrilled to see me as I them. Mike leases property from the paper mill for a family camp down the road. He's been fishing up here for decades. He didn't realize the AT went through until one day while fishing he heard voices and saw people walking along the other side of the stream. Up til then he'd been bushwhacking in from the logging roads. Mike also served in the Army at the same base in Fairbanks, Alaska as my dad. Turns out some of the wild stories my dad told me actually happened there, like the guy who drank Wild Turkey that'd been left outside in -40 degrees and froze his insides.
Not only was trail magic totally unexpected this deep in the 100 Mile Wilderness, but this was my first traditional trail magic of the entire thruhike! And it only took 2145 miles! I've passed coolers with cold drinks and snacks a couple of times, and gotten a serendipitous drink from someone who happened to be sitting at a trailhead, but nothing like the rolling feast that I saw almost everyday in the South last year in March and April. I don't mind - I actually think trail magic is overdone and I'd rather these wonderful trail angels feed people far less fortunate than hikers - but it does feel good to see people care.
Pat and Mike kept cooking up donuts and I kept eating. Must have had 8 or 9 over the course of an hour, along with 3 or 4 cups of coffee. With the morning chill and cold wind they were just what the doctor ordered. Another truck came through at one point and we had to move the table. It was what Pat called a couple of ""heater hunters"", guys who look for grouse while they roll along in their heated truck and shoot them if they can. If they don't see anything, no big deal, they had a couple of beers and a relaxing day. Sounds a lot like fishermen. The truck returned about twenty minutes later to troll in the other direction.
No other hikers appeared, but Pat and Mike were planning to stay most of the day and come back tomorrow. I thanked them profusely and headed off, having done exactly 0.3 miles by 10:30.
The trail was generally easy, even compared to other states, for several miles. I got my first view of Katahdin across Lake Pemadumcook. She was in the clouds, but still massive. 
A few minutes later a trio of southbounders that looked familiar came by. It was Yard Sale, who I last saw at the hostel in Hanover, and Reese's Pieces, the girl who had been recovering from plantar fasciitis at Charlie's in Vermont. They had picked up a companion Jeremy who had thruhiked in 2013 and was sectioning now. I gave each of them one of the donuts Pat had packed up for me.
The wind turned ferocious as I approached a campsite right on Lake Nahmakanta. There were actual whitecaps on the swells as they crashed on the narrow beach. As the trail wound around the lake I passed a lone backpacker asking if there was a privy at the campsite. 
I reached Wadleigh Stream Lean-To, where the log had a note from 5-Oh and Water Queen saying they'd had lunch there today. I probably missed them by just two hours. They had been 17 miles ahead of me when I left Shaw's two days ago, but now they must be just a few miles away. I figured they'd stop at either the next shelter or the campsite beyond it. Either way I'd catch them today and could accompany them until we summit.
I followed the trail around Crescent Pond. Several canoes and rowboats had been left at the water's edge. There was a dirt access road close by. If the wind hadn't been so cold I might have gone out for a paddle. Instead I followed the AT over Nesuntabunt Mountain, which just barely touched 2000 feet. It too had a lovely view of Katahdin, which was now in the clear and looking majestically imposing.
A SOBO passed me who was just starting out on his thruhike. I thought he was a flip-flopper at first due to his long beard and focused stride. I was startled to hear he was starting this late. He said he had left Katahdin yesterday and was trying to get to Monson in 4 days.
I made it to Rainbow Stream Lean-To at 5:30 after several miles of a tediously winding and rooty climb along the stream valley. I was hoping to find 5-Oh and Water Queen here, 8 miles from their lunch spot. But I guess they pressed on, hoping to get to the base of Katahdin tomorrow. So I donned my windjacket, hat, and gloves and got out my headlamp for another hike at dusk to a campsite 3.6 miles further.
The miles were Maine Easy - no big climbs or descents, just the usual rocks, roots, erratic turns, blowdowns, and occasional ledges. In any other state a section like this would have some grand name like Jacob's Ladder, Fatman Squeeze, the Rollercoaster, or Clarendon Gorge. Here, it's just a ""flat stretch"". However my tolerance for uneven terrain had grown to the point I was able to bang out the distance in under an hour, and without turning on my headlamp. 
Rainbow Spring Campsite is a few flat spots set well back from Rainbow Lake, with another artesian spring for water. A tarp was already set up and two people greeted me without getting out. They were sectioning the Wilderness. No sign of 5-Oh and Water Queen. Either I missed their tents somewhere or they hiked even further, though that seems unlikely. I was already 12 miles from where they'd had lunch, a long distance for them. Given the early darkness and rough terrain, it was plenty long for me as well. I stepped out to relieve myself before bed to a sky that was studded with stars. The moon hadn't yet risen and the Milky Way was transcendent. The wind had cleared the sky for tonight.","Potaywadjo Spring Lean-To
",Rainbow Spring Campsite,"Oct 08, Thu",22
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631283,"I woke early again, listening to the wind, and probably mice scurrying around the tent, but rolled over and didn't stir until the sun was fully on the tent. My last full day on trail. I was reluctant to start, because that brought the end closer. 
I miss my family. I want to be with them. But neither do I want this journey to end. For all the discomforts and trials, it has been my life for four months. I've grown accustomed to its rhythms, its highs and lows. I am experienced, I know exactly what I'm doing. And there is always an underlying sense of purpose, a drive forward that is not stressful, but provides meaning and direction. It's hard to imagine anything similar in ""real life"", though maybe it's just a matter of perspective.
The other two tenters are a couple sectioning the Wilderness. I leapfrogged with them most of the morning before I crept ahead. They haven't seen my friends 5-Oh and Water Queen. I meandered along gorgeous Rainbow Lake, shimmering in an unearthly deep blue in the early morning sun. If not for the frigid temperature and wind (last night was the freezing night, not the previous night), I would have gladly dove in. I almost did anyway. I could die happily by a lake in Maine. 
The trail went over Rainbow Ledges, the last hill before Katahdin. It was sadly bereft of blueberries. I remembered fondly being waylaid for an hour picking these succulent fruits on my last trip through a year ago August. On previous trips I had felt a definite loss of energy climbing this middling hill. But today I must have had enough calories or sugar or salt. Or maybe the chill wind is a better energizer than humidity. Whatever the reason the climb was easy and pleasant. 
I didn't find Water Queen and 5-Oh at Hurd Brook Lean-To or at the Golden Road as I exited the Wilderness. I must have passed them somehow. I walked down the dirt highway as trucks occasionally passed in a dusty cloud. At Abol Bridge, Katahdin loomed almost near enough to touch. 
I found Jinx hanging out at the campstore near Abol Bridge. Unfortunately the store had closed for the winter. I first met Jinx when he wandered by Mike and I on Katahdin Ironworks Road looking to get a ride further up trail to a birthday party for Hippie, one of his tramily mates. He made it, but separated from the tramily again and has been hanging out here for the last day waiting for Walmart, Hippie, and the others. I assured him they were not behind him as I'd seen no one. We figured they either summited yesterday or today, though they weren't on the Birches list either day, or they went into Millinocket to wait. There's no service here to find out. I am similarly mystified as to where Water Queen and 5-Oh ended up. They didn't sign up for the Birches either. 
I hiked ten miles through Baxter State Park, up along Nesowadnehunk Stream. At one point I laid on a ledge next to the water as it dashed over in a waterfall. Last summer I'd relaxed here with UNICEF, Two Blades, Fresh Prints, and Silent Bob as I accompanied them on the completion of their thruhikes. I felt alone, yet strangely fulfilled, accompanied by ghosts of the past. The sun was warm. I didn't want to get up. 
But I did. I hiked past Big and Little Niagara Falls, Daicey and Grassy Ponds, in the shadow of Katahdin. At Daicey's trailhead I saw an updated weather forecast: 80% chance of showers on the summit tomorrow. Not good.  I decided that, with no one else summiting with me, tomorrow would be a mistake. At Katahdin Stream Campground I couldn't find the ranger responsible for checking in. Two rangers going over papers in the tailgate of a pickup truck had no interest in helping me. So I decided to hitch into town. At first I had no luck. Jinx, who'd hiked out ahead of me, had disappeared. It was almost sunset, and there was very little traffic leaving the park this late. I thumbed at a car but it blew by. Two other guys who'd also tried to hitch called out to me. Turned out they were walking toward their car at another trailhead just two miles away. Town was twenty miles. They offered to drive me in once they got their car. Finally a break!
Eventually a car stopped and ferried one of them, Austin, to their car and he came back to pick up me and his friend Brian. As we're driving off he casually mentioned that the couple in the other car knew me. Austin had told them I was a thruhiker from Pennsylvania but couldn't remember my name. They asked if it was Valley Forge. It was Speak Up and Lana! They had just finished the last leg of their trip and were driving back to their van in Monson. Bummer that I missed them, but what a fantastic coincidence that they came by just as we needed help. The trail really does provide. Austin and Brian are from Syracuse. They'd just climbed Katahdin today, their first excursion to Maine. Austin has considered a thruhike before, while Brian has young kids, and both were interested in my experience. One question, how was I going to celebrate finishing, stumped me. I popped champagne back in Monson, but that was more for show than anything meaningful. I don't know if celebration is the right word. Marking the end of the journey is enough. I got out of it what I can. It will take time to process it all. What I know is that seeing that sign at the summit won't bring the closure I've been seeking since I started hiking. Because there is no closure. Hiking is just a metaphor for life. And life is a journey, not a destination. There is no closure, until it's all over. Until then you learn what you can, and you do your best for yourself and the people around you.
Austin and I also shared a fascination with political economy and geopolitical strategy. They were interesting guys and I feel lucky to have met them. They dropped me in the middle of Millinocket, near a boarding house, having gone ten miles out of their way. 
The boarding house owner, Susan, was not in town and directed me to the Blue Ox Saloon where the bartender Tom situated me. I ended up spending most of the evening in the saloon enjoying company and some calzone from Scootic's across the street. Tomorrow I will zero to wait out the rain. By then I hope some of my friends will be ready to summit with me. Sunday looks like a beautiful day to climb a mountain.","Rainbow Spring Campsite
",Katahdin Stream Campground (Millinocket),"Oct 09, Fri",21.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631353,"The bed at Sweet Lillian's was as comfortable as advertised. It took an effort to get up this morning. I had a slight hangover from two draft beers and some sort of whiskey Tom had gifted me - perhaps in recognition he'd shorted me on change. Anyway, yes, I am a lightweight when it comes to alcohol. A hot shower cleared things up nicely. 
I was headed out to get breakfast at the Appalachian Trail Cafe when the two third-floor tenants - a father and son - cornered me and were in a chatty mood. The 62-year-old dad regaled me on the day he jogged 90 miles in his Indiana hometown, right after telling me he might be too old to hike the trail. His grown son, whom dad seemed to have little patience for, got on the topic of gangs in his childhood home of Worcester, Mass. My stomach was becoming almost as vocal as these two so I excused myself politely. 
The Appalachian Trail Cafe as recently as last summer was a great breakfast joint owned by Ole Man, who also runs the well-known AT Lodge hostel in town. Last week he closed the hostel for the season, and rumour has it he wants to sell, being tired of hosting hikers. I remember him telling me last year how NOBOs completing thruhikes act very entitled. Well, the cafe has apparently already gotten new management because it now sports a Mexican menu and is only open three days a week (and Saturday mornings to pick up pre-ordered donuts...??) So much for breakfast. Downtown Millinocket had no other open restaurants. In fact the main street was deserted on a Saturday morning, nothing at all was open, and half the store fronts are in various states of collapse.
So I walked a mile and a half out to the highway strip where there's fast food and a supermarket. I ate at a Chester Chicken franchise, where the woman runs it as a breakfast diner before the fast food chicken menu kicks in at lunchtime. Apparently this is a very flexible franchise. I topped off breakfast with a double cheeseburger and sweet tea from McDonalds, walked by the Baxter State Park Headquarters, currently closed to the public but at least I got a map, and on to the Hannaford's supermarket to load up on drinks and snacks for the day. The local paper had a story of a helicopter evacuation of a 13-year-old boy from Katahdin a few days ago who had an unspecified medical emergency. There have also been two deaths on the mountain in the last week - one found frozen who they've not been able to identify, and another who was caught on the mountain with a friend overnight and fell 50 feet. Quite a bad week, and a powerful lesson never to underestimate the mountain.
Ironically, as I walked the mile and a half back to town, I had a good view of Katahdin and it was perfectly in the clear. The forecast had been way off. Those certain showers and thunderstorms had pushed off into the evening. Not only was there no storm, or even clouds, it was the warmest day on the summit in weeks. It would have been a fantastic day to summit. Ah, well.
Back at the hostel, the owner Susan showed up to tell me I'd taken the wrong room. Susan is pretty abrasive and foul-mouthed with a veneer of charm, a lot like Tom, though there seems to be no love lost between them. When I called her last evening at 7 about a room she was not shy about letting me know she was three sheets to the wind, so sent me to Tom to let me into the place. Tom, the Blue Ox Saloon owner and bartender, showed off the rooms like it was the Taj Mahal and urged me to take any that I wanted. I took the first one he showed me. That was to go to a new tenant of Susan's arriving this afternoon. The tenant pulled up as she was scolding me. Susan has no filter, so had to tell me her low view of the fact that the new tenant was a 19-year-old mom with a 3-year-old boy (an adorable kid, I might add). They were driven in by a middle-aged woman, maybe the grandmom, who provoked some shockingly profane responses from Susan with innocuous banter.
""Hi Susan! What've you been up to?""""Working! That's what I've been $#@* up to!""""Ah, well you've gotta work harder then!""""You know what?  [long pause...]  #@&%* you!!""
The conversation ended awkwardly there, as the young mom and her son gathered their things and were welcomed with a smile. My own smile, frozen on my face, covered my thoughts that maybe I should get back into the park today and prepare to summit in the morning.
Thus began a series of calls with local shuttlers and a Baxter Park staffer. I couldn't just drive back to Katahdin Stream Campground where I'd left last night. I had no camping reservation or parking pass. The shuttlers said it didn't matter if they were just dropping me off, I needed a pass - the shuttlers don't have one. Parking passes and camping spots sold out long ago. You have to arrive at 5 am (or earlier) and wait to see if a pass is freed up by a no-show, then if you're lucky get in after 7. I played the thruhiker card, for what it's worth at Baxter, which seems to wish we didn't exist. No dice. By leaving the park, I was no longer a ""long distance hiker"". So I couldn't use the Birches shelter. Therefore I needed a camping reservation. When I asked whether someone could drive me into the park this afternoon the question was ""Then what's your plan? Where will you camp?"" Hikers often find a place with other campers, or reserve a spot left by a no-show, but none of this was good enough. I was persona non grata unless I had a reservation.
I thought about this. Where did I go wrong? I left the park because the rangers' forecast said it was dangerous to climb Katahdin. Had I stayed to climb I could have used the Birches, but I would have been creating a risky situation for me and possibly rescuers. If I chose not to climb their regs wouldn't let me camp in the park - all the sites were booked and stealth camping is illegal. So I did the only thing they allow - I left the park. Now the next day I wanted to return and pick up exactly where I left off. I didn't run off to Vegas for a week. I got off their land for one night to follow their rules. In hindsight staying inside the park was the best option - I would have found a spot somewhere, probably with a ranger's help. My mistake was leaving the park, thus empowering the gatekeepers. Imagine if every state park had convoluted regs like this. Thruhiking legally would be impossible. It's not that the Baxter leaders don't like thruhikers - they don't like people of any kind coming through what they see as a wilderness preserve, not as a park for people to enjoy. The Kafkaesque rules are mostly to discourage use, not to channel it in manageable ways. I wanted to channel my inner Susan and tell them what I thought of their policies.
In the end I had several options: 
1) go back to Georgia, or at least Monson,  start again, and do it right this time!
2) get a shuttle at 4 am to the gate and wait for a parking pass to free up.
3) get a ride to Abol Bridge, just south of the park, walk in like I did yesterday and sign up for The Birches shelter (illegally since in Baxter's eyes I'm no longer a long-distance hiker - sigh)
4) get a ride to the park gate, sneak around the entrance on foot, and hitch up to the campground and register at the Birches. Really illegal and risking some fines. Not to mention finding a driver willing to help me. Chutzpah factor: 10 out of 10
5) hitch into the park with a party that has a reservation, then either camp with them or try for the Birches
6) get a shuttle into the park and pretend we're there to pick up a thruhiker. Baxter allows pickups late in the day without a parking pass. Obviously unethical and what shuttler would help me do this?
#5 was the most attractive option, so I went to Susan to explain I wouldn't be staying another night. I thought perhaps freeing up the room for her tenant would be welcome in exchange for a ride or at least a refund. But I didn't have a chance to ask because she immediately exclaimed she wouldn't drive me anywhere. She was far too busy (sitting on a chair drinking) and the roads were awful, you needed a special high-clearance vehicle. I didn't bother mentioning the VW Golf that brought me to town last night. When it occurred to her I might be looking for a refund she put the kibosh on that too: You paid in advance, right? You'll have to find Tom. Suddenly it occurred to her that she may be coming across poorly: ""Oh, wait! You're not gonna leave a bad review?"" Her tone mellowed as she confided to me her issues with Tom, and how the vibe in the house was better when it was full of hikers. She then disappeared in the few minutes it took me to pack up. When I called to say the room was vacant she seemed to be in full damage control, offering I could come back tomorrow night or grab a shower. Well, that's thoughtful, but I didn't expect to take her up on it. I'd had enough drama.
I walked out of town a mile and a half along the road to Baxter to where I could hitch with confidence that nearly everyone was headed to the park. Traffic was light but after twenty minutes a couple dozen vehicles had passed, enough to tell me hitching was unlikely to work. I gave in and called a shuttler, ponied up 40 bucks and took option #3. I would go back to Abol Bridge, and hike in. I would get around the gatekeepers by coming through the back door. It was nearly 3 and I was burning daylight.
Chris from Pamola Motor Lodge drove me up. In addition to running the motel and tending its bar, he does painting jobs and acts as the town's taxi. He also hosts pool tournaments and well-known professional players. He dropped me as close to the Baxter Park boundary as the road could go. 
I walked over the same ground as yesterday to the kiosk at the park border. A young ranger was there and helped me sign up for the Birches. I didn't mention this was my second try. Then I hiked four and half miles - making nine miles for the day - over the Blueberry Ledges Trail to Katahdin Stream Campground. This was not the AT. The AT follows a circuitous 9 mile route along Nesowadnehunk Stream to reach the same spot. This was a shortcut, and I would probably not have taken this option if I had to follow the same AT path I took yesterday. 
The path led directly through the Birches. There I found Water Queen and 5-Oh at last! We were all thrilled to see each other. They'd seen my name on the board yesterday and assumed I'd summited. I had passed them in the Wilderness without realizing it. Turns out the evening I thought I would catch them at Rainbow Stream Lean-To I actually did catch them. They were tenting just out of sight over the hill. I had considered at the time calling out to see if anyone was around, but thought better of it, embarrassed to be yelling in the woods and seeing no likely spots for them to hide. I'd ended up hiking another 3.6 miles past dusk to Rainbow Spring Campsite. Could have saved myself a lot of aggravation the last two days if I'd just called out.
I went out searching for the campground ranger to register for the Birches, but he wasn't at his station at 5:20, only a sign saying he'd be back at 5. Nor was he anywhere in the campground. So I hiked back to the Birches where a truck was parked. But it wasn't a ranger's truck - it belonged to a local named Dana who had brought trail magic to our little camp! He had a cooler full of sodas and beer, chips, cookies, and three pizzas! Fortunately there was also a trio hiking the 100 Mile Wilderness staying here to help us make a dent in this feast. 
A ranger eventually appeared to fill out my paperwork - in triplicate - and assign me NOBO permit #310. My first official recognition of a thruhike. He'd just come from a debriefing on one of the week's search and rescue operations. I asked about the possibility of ice on the climb in the morning, but he didn't seem concerned.
The shelters at the Birches are boarded up, because Covid, so everyone tented. Which made the powerful thunderstorms that rolled through between 8 and 10 pretty exciting. I haven't had the tent up in anything that fierce before. I think it was hailing for a time. I haven't seen a thunderstorm at all since the one that spun off tornadoes in Connecticut. Tomorrow's high on the summit is expected to be 32, so I'm expecting a bit of ice, sleet, or rime up there.","Katahdin Stream Campground (Millinocket)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631354,"It poured on and off for hours overnight, then rained and sleeted steadily. By morning it was still sprinkling on and off. Not good. The heavy rain had spattered off the gravelly ground and wet much of my gear. So much for Zpacks bathtub tent floor.
We didn't bother getting up until the rain had stopped and the sun was up. We headed down to the ranger station, put some heavy stuff in storage, and saw the weather forecast for the summit: a high of 28, winds around 25mph, and a warning: Dangerous icing conditions. Not good.
We met two rangers as we went through the campground toward the trailhead. We could see the mountain, or at least the part that wasn't in a cloud, and it looked like pictures of Mt. Everest. There was clearly a lot of snow and ice up there. We asked the ranger if we should summit today. He hesitated, trying to break the news to us gently. The advice was no, it's very icy and dangerous. From what we could see, we agreed. A real letdown. Yesterday was a fantastic day to summit but the forecast had said otherwise. Today was forecast to be a good day, but reality was far different. Frustrating! 
The question was what to do. We couldn't wait a few hours for the sun to melt the ice and hike later. There wouldn't be enough time to get down before dark. We had to try again tomorrow. The rangers, particularly the senior one named Bruce, were kind enough to let us stay at the Birches a second night. But it was a cold day, nowhere to warm up, and Water Queen and 5-Oh were low on food and very grungy from a week without a shower. Plus my dad and brother were coming to town today. We opted to go into town for the day, and ranger Steve was nice enough to call a shuttle for us. We set up our tents at the Birches again while the shuttle made its way in. 
In town we bought crampons at Katahdin General Store on the advice of the rangers, hit the supermarket, and lunched at House of Pizza. Dana, our trail angel from last night, apparently owns or delivers for them and we thanked them for his kindness.
My brother and father made it to town after a ten hour drive from Pennsylvania. It's the first time I've seen my dad in many months. I am so happy they could be here. And I regretted asking them to wait another day so I could summit tomorrow. We took 5-Oh and Water Queen to Sweet Lillian's where Susan had offered me a shower if I came back to town. She was very pleasant and happily took in the two of them for a few hours for showers and a rest in a warm room while my dad, brother and I went for a late lunch. 
My brother Chris found a surprisingly nice place called the River Driver's Restaurant at the NEOC (New England Outdoor Center) on Lake Millinocket with a view of Katahdin,  where I had my fill of lobster bisque. We found them a motel room for the night then picked up Water Queen and 5-Oh to re-enter Baxter State Park. It's a 24 mile trip from town to the Birches, and we only got into the park thanks to a camping reservation form that ranger Steve had given us for that purpose. 
At the Birches we found Spurs, Wild, Muck Fichigan, Colonel Clothesline, Sunset, and Brightside. Another happy reunion. They'd been wondering whose tents these were, thinking I'd summited two days ago. My dad brought lots of snack foods which the hikers fell upon and devoured. Muck was down to a package of Ramen and nothing else and was particularly grateful for the calorie infusion. 
We built a fire and enjoyed a couple cold but happy hours swapping stories and telling jokes before hitting our tents to rest up for the big day. Third time's the charm!","Katahdin Stream Campground

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631508,"After two strikes due to weather, today was my third shot at summiting Katahdin. Whether I made it or not today, my family would have to drive home due to another commitment. The weather didn't look likely to improve this week thanks to the remnants of Hurricane Delta, so I could be stuck for awhile. 
It's been a bad week on Katahdin. Last Sunday a boy was helicoptered out due to a medical emergency. Then Thursday a body was found on Katahdin's Baxter Peak near the sign. A hiker had climbed up overnight with insufficient gear for the single digit temperature and high winds and literally froze. A group of thruhikers had tried to summit on Thursday but turned back just a half mile from the summit when the body was found. In a separate incident a man and his grown nephew got lost in fog on the Knife Edge. The man fell 50 feet, and died after being transported out the following morning.
It didn't look promising around 5 am when I woke to find frozen condensation on the inside of the tent. Outside, the water bottles were frozen. If it's freezing down here, how much ice is up there?
We took our time getting ready. Let the sun melt what it could before we got there. Around 6:30 two hikers walked quickly through the Birches camp from the Blueberry Ledges Trail I'd come up two days ago. I figured they had stealth camped to avoid the rangers.
Wild and Spurs were the first ones out, then Colonel Clothesline, Sunset and Brightside. Water Queen, 5-Oh!, and I headed out, leaving Muck finishing a large breakfast of oranges and snacks my dad had left last night. We dropped some of our gear at the ranger station to lighten the packs. Only Wild carried all his gear, on principle. I kept all my clothes (for warmth), quilt (to bulk up the pack), snacks, water, first aid, headlamp, spare battery, and trekking poles. The tent, sleeping pad, and extra food stayed behind.
The forecast posted at the ranger station (keep in mind there's no cell service in Baxter) was only marginally better than yesterday: high of 34, wind chill of 16, clear skies. If there was ice up there, it was hard to imagine it melting this morning. However, we could see that the peak was already in the clear and didn't appear to have much snow or ice. We would have to climb to find out for sure. Expecting a frigid summit, I'd put on every layer I own: T-shirt, long-sleeved fleece, puffy, windjacket, long johns, pants, hat, buff, gloves, and even glove liners. Even so, my fingers felt numb from the time I got up until two miles into the hike. 
In the campground parking lot a group of thruhikers I'd never seen were milling around a car preparing to climb:  Caveman, Hippie, Noah, Tags (all guys), Faith, Hanna, and Peach (girls). Peach (AT '18) wasn't thruhiking but supporting this group with her car. She hoped to summit just for fun. Several of them had stayed in the campground with a reservation last night. Hippie and Caveman had been dropped off at Abol Bridge early this morning and hiked 4.5 miles here. Peach and Tags had driven to the entrance gate at 5 am and waited for a parking pass, which despite all warnings had been easy to get at 7 am. Most of this group had been among those who turned back on Thursday due to snow, ice, and the frozen hiker. Only a handful, including Walmart, Shark Boi and Lava Girl, had made it. This group has been waiting out the weather in Millinocket, with a short excursion to Acadia.
We started up at quarter of 8. The climb began easily enough through spruce forest with minimal rocks and moderate grade, across a bridge over Katahdin Stream. A mile and a half in the climb steepened, with rock staircases yielding to boulder scrambles with trees for handholds. Some of the scrambles were difficult enough that hikers had worn alternate routes around.
Once above treeline the view opened up to a panoramic landscape of yellow birch forests enclosing countless lakes and ponds dotted by small islands. The horizon swelled with distant blue mountains to the south and west, while impressive vertical cliffs and rockslides loomed on the nearby Brothers and Cox mountains. 
The boulder scramble turned into a seemingly-vertical version of Mahoosuc Notch. Car- and bus-sized boulders make up the Spur along the steep spiny ridge to the summit. The diciest spots have metal rods driven into the rock to prevent you sliding off the mountain. Many spots were multiple choice, with the blazes being suggestions but not necessarily the easiest or safest path. Though the trail seemed insanely steep, the drop-off on either side was far steeper. This was the most difficult but most exhilarating section, perhaps of the entire trail. Yet tens of thousands of hikers of all ages and experience levels make it through each year. It's amazing there aren't more rescues.
There was a small bit of ice below tree line, especially where a spring ran down the trail, and I slipped once or twice, proving what I feared, that Altras are useless on ice. I would never have made it yesterday with all that ice. Above tree line it was dry thanks to no water source and a day of sun yesterday. Only once I reached the Tableland did I see any more ice or rime. 
The weather turned out to be not only better than expected, but nearly perfect. There was no wind. At all. Complete silence when I stopped to listen. The sun was on me the whole time above treeline and I quickly stripped off my puffy, windjacket, hat, gloves, buff and even my fleece, continuing in just a T-shirt and remaining quite comfortable until late in the day. I regretted having left my long johns on under my pants. Today was a shorts kind of day. 
I started up with 5-Oh! and Water Queen, but 5-Oh! soon disappeared as Hippie passed and he pushed to keep pace. After laughing at my suggestion it would take 3.5 hours to summit as far too aggressive, he ended taking only 2.5 hours and was one of the first thruhikers at the summit. 
Water Queen urged me to hike ahead, telling me she would be taking it nice and easy. I was in no rush, and I didn't want to leave her alone to face the boulders, but she got this far on her own and didn't need a babysitter. I headed up, catching up with Peach. She turned out to be a fellow Philly suburbanite, from the Main Line not far from me. She'd been laid off from her bartender job due to Governor Wolf shutting down businesses and decided to get out and hike a bit and help fellow hikers. Caveman and the others were not far behind.
On the Spur I caught Wild and Spurs. Wild was filming copiously for the final chapter of his YouTube series. Spurs was trucking ahead, belying his normally easy pace. We hiked up to the Gateway together, and across the Tableland, spattered with frost, frozen puddles, and ice rime on the krumholtz. Muck passed, the last one to start but still one of the first to summit. He can lay on the speed when he wants. ""Time to go to the whip!"" he told me once, like he was a race horse. He still has a thousand miles or so to finish the northbound half of his yo-yo hike. Spurs has a few hundred miles south of Damascus to finish. 
Spurs and I approached Baxter Peak over a rocky landscape with only the hardiest of low-lying alpine plants, reminiscent of Mt. Washington. We could see people on the ridge above. If not for them we would have thought the summit was a mile further - the perspective makes East Peak look higher than Baxter. 
I'd been thinking about this moment for days. I didn't let myself dwell on it earlier than that, it was too far off and I wanted to focus on where I was, not where I'd be. Now here I was, and my emotions were far from clear. I didn't feel pride or joy at walking 2200 miles. Right now this felt like a dayhike. The magnitude of what I'd done simply hadn't sunk in. I felt a twinge of sadness knowing, in my head if not yet my heart, that my time out here was over. I was strong, I was prepared, I was good at this. I'd come through dark moments and made it all the way - what could stop me now? But that regret was more than offset knowing I would soon see my family, and that my ""job"" of hiking was nearly done. With winter approaching it made leaving more palatable. 
I'd have plenty of time for reflection once I got home. Today - now - it was time to enjoy the moment. 
Spurs walked up to the sign marking the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. I followed at a distance, walking slowly until I could place my hand on the weathered wood and barely legible lettering. It was dry and warm. The Long Cruise was over.
I spent two hours on the summit. It felt like a summer day. I could have stayed there forever, a moment frozen in time. Thruhikers kept coming. Each of us got our pictures. The solemn, the joyful, the triumphant, the silly. Eighteen thruhikers in all, including the handful with flips still to flop. Jinx, the kid I'd found at the Abol Bridge campstore Friday waiting for his tramily, eventually appeared. He'd managed to summit with his tramily after all - Hippie, Faith, Peach, and the rest - though Walmart, his oldest friend, had already finished on that unfortunate Thursday. 
Water Queen was one of the last to arrive, shortly after noon. She had many friends here. I walked down to shout encouragement and escort her up. When I turned to follow her I saw the hikers had formed a honor guard in two lines with their arms raised to form a tunnel for her to walk through, the Katahdin sign at the far end. She was the only one to have that honor bestowed. 
A number of dayhikers came and went, including a couple of large groups. A mom and her two sons, one of them about eight years old, came up the Saddle Trail from Chimney Pond, seven miles one way. There are no easy ways up Katahdin. Several headed over the Knife Edge, a perfect day for this exposed but stunning route. I hiked it last year, but today I needed no more excitement. 
Hikers began drifting away, many headed down the alternate Abol Trail. 5-Oh!, Water Queen and I headed back down Hunt trail, the AT. If we'd hit this descent at any other point it probably would have been downright frightening. But having just climbed it, and having great weather, we laughed at the difficulty, the steepness, the sheer insanity of it. We'd just thruhiked the Appalachian Trail, what was another rock scramble?
I must have gotten a little cocky. I wasn't in a rush, but I let my shoelace catch on a root below treeline. I was several feet above where my next step would have gone. I couldn't get my leg in front of me. I was going doooowwn! Whether luck or experience or a bit of both, I managed to slow the fall. I couldn't stop my body but my muscles tensed and I was able to get my arms in front as I gradually toppled toward the rocks below. My hands hit first and my arms absorbed the momentum, bringing my head to an awkward stop, inches from the rocks. Well, that was close! 5-Oh looked worried, unable to help me in time and watching my slow-motion disaster unfold. I'd spent weeks reminding myself that any bad step could be my last. Don't be the guy that ends his hike climbing Katahdin! But descending it after a successful finish? Fortunately I wouldn't be making any ironic headlines today. I was unhurt, just shaken. No thanks to the ridiculously long laces on these Altras.
Nearing the campground I passed Peach walking down with Tags. He'd hurt his eye somehow and needed her guiding hand. 
Back at the ranger station Muck was relaxing in the shade. He was talking to Cowboy, who'd just walked in. I'd met him in the first few miles of the 100 Mile Wilderness when I was slackpacking. This was his tenth day since leaving Monson and he was nearly out of food. We offered him all that we had. I took his trash, and even gave him my unused pair of crampons, in case tomorrow's weather was less favorable. 
Another thruhiker named Guardian was tenting in the campground. He'd flipped up from Virginia, having only started in July and taken time off. This odd year continues, with hikers departing Maine even in October with months of travel still ahead of them. 
Mike from Shaw's appeared to pick up Muck, Spurs, and several others. We found my father and brother waiting for us and drove the eight bumpy miles out of the park - the third time in three days for me - and another eighteen to Millinocket for some post-summit calories at Dunkin Donuts. We shuttled Water Queen and 5-Oh! to a Holiday Inn in Bangor an hour south, where tomorrow they'll rent a car and take Water Queen to Hanover. She'll hike south from there to her Katahdin at a road crossing in Maryland. 5-Oh! is headed home to South Carolina. Being a cop, most recently a training instructor, he took his name from the slang ""5-0"" for police. The ""Oh!"" came from a hiker's exclamation when offering him weed and then learning he was a cop. He is very humble and funny, and a genuinely nice guy. Despite knowing Water Queen since early July, I only learned her full story today. She started in Georgia in March with her daughter, who had asked her mom to join her on a thruhike. They got off in Georgia when the ATC started pushing hikers to go home. Her daughter decided not to come back, but Water Queen got back on trail on her own. She hiked from Georgia to Maryland before jumping to Hanover. She knew some of the folks we summited with today from the early days in Georgia. And her name comes from sitting in streams to cool off. Good luck to her in finishing her hike!
My father, brother, and I headed down to Portland for the night and for a seafood dinner. Unfortunately Andy's Old Port Pub was fresh out of lobster (really? in Maine?), but we enjoyed ourselves anyway. The next day we made it home to Pennsylvania after over ten hours of driving. I can't thank my brother Chris and my dad enough for coming to Maine to get me, and for cooling their heels an extra day so I could climb Katahdin. I am a lucky guy to have a family like this.
I was pretty wiped out by the end of the day and the thoughts were still swirling around. Once they settle I hope to have a few final observations on my thruhike, and how it has affected me.","Katahdin Stream Campground
",Baxter Peak,"Oct 12, Mon",5.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632626,"A month has passed since I summited Katahdin, a good time to look back and reflect on the thruhike. Perhaps surprisingly the month has flown by. I was fortunate not to have to dive back into work, but have rather enjoyed the simple pleasures of spending time with my family, taking up running again, and going on three weekend camping trips with the scouts. Not to mention sleeping in a warm bed and having easy access to ""town food"" almost every day.
The dreaded post-trail depression has been fairly mild. It hit harder after my first long section hike a few years back. There are still moments when I feel a bit out of place, or long to be back out there. But there will be time for that again someday. God willing, I have a few more decades of hiking in me. It's hard to imagine this is my last long hike. So while I have no immediate plans, the mere possibility may be helping to tamp down my wanderlust.
Having now both thruhiked and section-hiked the AT, I'm in a rare position to compare the experiences. But before I do that, clearly my thruhike was unusual in several ways. I started in June, months later than the bubble. And Covid drove away hikers who would normally have started in late March and April. As a result I could count on two hands the number of thruhikers I met before Vermont. I had to cover twenty miles a day on average, so my meetings with those few thruhikers were always short-lived. I felt like the sweeper, knowing anyone I passed would have to flip up north or come up short. Unfortunatley that came true as one of the folks who didn't flip, Lucky Charms, reached Katahdin just days after me and found it closed for the season. 
The irony was that I was the slowest of the late starters. At least five others who started in early June - Slingshot, Dunda, Sunshine, Lone Wolf, and Danny - finished in under 100 days, a month before me. But that was not the kind of hike I wanted. I didn't want to feel rushed every day. I kept a steady pace that would get me to Maine on time, but still allow for fun and serendipity along the way. I logged only one day over 30 miles, and very few over 25. 
The reaction to Covid was another unusual factor. After all the ATC's drama in the spring, every section of trail was open by the time I reached it. The main effect on trail was to reduce the number of section hikers but to increase the number of dayhikers looking to get out of the house. I missed the section hikers. And while I'm always friendly with dayhikers (being one myself most of the time) it's hard to establish a rapport since they often haven't the faintest idea what I'm doing and don't care. In some areas like northern Virginia they would often mask up, step off trail, and turn away from me like I'm a leper. The upshot being that along most of the trail I saw very few hikers, but in popular areas I had to wade through hordes of anxious and sometimes unfriendly people. 
Hitchhiking didn't seem much affected. The same people who wouldn't pick me up in any other year wouldn't pick me up this year. But almost always a trail angel would come along eventually to help. As far as restaurants and stores, they were all open. In the South businesses were operating normally with the exception of fast food joints, leading to sometimes hilarious results like being told to go sit on the bike rack at the drive-in Dairy King in Waynesboro. In the North and especially New England there was much more street theater. Dartmouth students lying on the Green a hundred feet from anyone were required to mask up while dozens of al fresco diners congregated maskless on sidewalks a block away. Temperature checks at the grocery store in Salisbury. The Chinese takeout in Gorham that pushed our food through a kitty door.
While most of the hiker hostels were open and most were business-as-usual and as wonderful as ever, there were a handful that were either paranoid or simply self-righteous. The Notch in NH and the Hostel of Maine get special mention for the latter. Wherever masks were enforced the owners were also clearly political, displaying flags that supported fashionable causes, and would make sure you knew their view was the only acceptable one. Where masks weren't a thing, politics wasn't either. 
So while town visits were on the whole less pleasant and often surreal, Covid had no real impact on the hike itself. The views were still gorgeous, the humidity was still ungodly, and the long-distance hikers were just as friendly. Many shelters and privies were technically closed, but beyond the occasional sign at a trailhead they were the same as ever. Those who like shelters continued to use them. And everyone used the privies. As the trail maintainers in Massachusetts told me, they were exercising civil disobedience in asking us to use the shelters rather than stealth camp and damage the rare flora. Some portions of the trail were not as well maintained since many trail clubs were under orders from the ATC not to send out crews. But many did anyway, and few sections were in seriously bad shape. The worst was New York, but that was due to a storm not to deferred maintenance. My respect for the trail crews has only grown, having seen the amount of growth and deadfall that accumulates over just a single season.
Two other factors made this hike unusual. For one, there was relatively little rain. I got wet almost every day in the first month, but after Damascus rain was rare. From the day I left Connecticut til I reached the Kennebec in Maine it may have rained once. Though when it rained it poured - there were 3 or 4 days when I walked through the Appalachian Stream for hours. The lack of rain led to many water sources drying up in the mid-Atlantic and even in New England. Fortunately I'm a camel and can hike, absent extreme heat, 10-20 miles on a liter of water so this wasn't a major hurdle. 
The last unusual factor was a paucity of insects. The first night at Springer Mountain Shelter was the worst as far as bugs. After that I was rarely bothered. No gnats buzzing constantly around me, no skeeters waiting to attack the second I stopped for a break, no nasty flies biting me. Of course there were a few here and there, but not even close to the usual clouds of attackers that can drive one mad. 
The lack of rain and bugs meant that once I got past the humidity the hiking was as pleasant as could be. The autumn colors in Maine were the icing on the cake. There was a cold snap a couple weeks before the end that scared me, but the mercury soon rose and it was milder than I expected. 
So it was a lonely, dry, pleasant, and occasionally surreal hike. Contrast that to my section hikes which were often crowded, wet, and challenging. But putting aside the factors that made my thruhike unusual, how was it different than section-hiking over several years? 
Some section hikers complain it takes too long to get their hiker legs. I've not had that problem. Yes, I gained speed later in the thruhike, but I found the biggest determinant of speed was energy. If I wasn't eating, drinking, or sleeping enough I would feel sluggish. If the heat or humidity was too much, likewise. In any case, most of my sections were done within months of another, and I ran regularly in between so physically I was always ready to tackle the next section.  
Motivation was a big differentiator. My sections typically ranged from a week to 3 weeks. I rarely took a zero. I would have a definite destination and time frame and fairly firm schedule. If I was behind I had to catch up to finish on time. Motivation wasn't a concern since the end was always relatively close. I hypothesized that motivation would be the biggest challenge on a thruhike. In the end I think loneliness was the bigger psychological challenge, but motivation certainly loomed large at times. I addressed it by not thinking too directly about the enormity of the task ahead. It was enough to calculate the pace necessary to finish on time, then apply that pace to a near-term goal like the next town or state. But if all I did was follow a series of short-term distance goals I would have burned out. The true motivation was simply to appreciate being out there at all. How many of us get to do this, and how often in my life will that be the case? This was a rare opportunity, and I reminded myself everyday how lucky I was to be there at all. Getting to Katahdin wasn't the focus. It was finding joy somewhere in that day. So even if it was pouring on me, I could still find humor in the absurdity of sloshing 24 miles through a stream, and appreciate when the trees stopping dripping on me late in the day. And always on even the most challenging days I knew I would look back and remember and smile at it. How many bad days do we have at work or home where we can say that? 
On sections I would push myself hard, and I could sustain that for a week or two. But that doesn't work on a thruhike. Soon you start questioning what you're pushing for. You lose the joy and it becomes a job. Yes, I could have done an extra five miles many days, and physically I would have been fine. But I would have lost many opportunities to enjoy the experience along the way, and the emotional energy that they bring. If I could do it again I would slow down even more. Take an hour or two to sit by a stream or at a viewpoint. Take more long lunches and more naps. Four months is still too fast, but it's better than three.
I had hoped to fall into a loose-knit group of hikers going roughly my pace for most of the hike. Not a tramily that has to be together every night, but hikers I would regularly see. That didn't happen until Maine. In its absence I looked to Instagram to follow hikers I had met but would likely never see again. This wasn't something I ever attempted during a section, where I often did see at least a few hikers regularly. Aside from keeping in touch with a good friend I don't think I would rely on it again. The electronic medium seems completely out of place on trail. Face-to-face interactions are natural and more fitting. It also pulls you away from the present and your surroundings into someone else's reality, perhaps somewhere you were at weeks ago or will be at in the future. Part of the joy of hiking is being immersed in the immediacy of the present and the proximate. 
I embraced the title of thruhiker after all those sections because it meant that I belonged in this place, that I was not just a visitor. My life, for those few months, was walking from town to town over mountain ranges to the point it became the natural thing to do. Not second nature, just nature. Which is why it was mildly jarring to so easily return to the ""real world"" and slip back into my old life. But perhaps that's a good thing. Learning to be comfortable in different worlds, to adapt to new circumstances, isn't that a big part of why we travel in the first place? 
This was an epic hike, but it won't be my last visit to a long trail. For many it's a once and done deal, a bucket list item to check off. For me, it's become a part of who I am. You can take the hiker out of the mountains, but you can't take the mountains out of the hiker.",,View Entry,"Nov 13, Fri",0
