JERMS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627803,"After the drop off and goodbyes at Kittattiny Visitor Center on the NJ side of Delaware Water Gap, me, Frank, and Tony walked just about a mile and we entered Pennsylvania. Couple quick pics at the border and onto the Village Farmer Bakery for some apple pie. After Tony ruined the port a pottie we were off into the woods. Some really nice views of the river for the first couple hours then onto the ridge for several hours of rocky trail. First spot for the night was a stealth site near Wolf Rocks.","Kittatinny Visitor Center

JERMS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627805,"Below freezing last night, froze our water. Took awhile to get to sleep then woke up every time I turned a little in the hammock. Packed up and started hiking. Filter froze so we couldn't treat water so H2O rationing was in play until we made it to the Wind Gap road crossing. My hiking App Guthooks said water could be had at the Gateway Motel about a half mile from the trail. Allison at the Gateway hooked us up with water and even offered some snacks or even equipment if we needed. Thanks Allison! Back to the trail for our climb out of Wind Gap. Day 2 was tough on the feet for us, and the weather became raw and windy. We found a semi-flat campsite and struggled maintaining a fire during dinner. We marveled over how pointy the rocks are on the trail. We believe that Trail Gnomes come out at night and file the rocks into little points and place them every so carefully to twist your ankles and poke into the bottoms of your feet with every step. Tony swore that he could hear them chant each night when they were done, ""Long Live the Trail"".","Stealth Site Near Wolf Rocks

JERMS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627818,"Last night was wet and windy. Horrible sleep in hammock, if it was sleep. Very warm and comfortable when starting then as soon as I turn left or right I lose the ""sweet spot"" of laying in a hammock and then its a struggle to get comfortable again sleeping primarily on my back. Did learn something last night when I shined my light into the woods. Apparently hunters will place these thumbtack size reflectors on trees to help guide them in the early morning, well these reflectors at 3am look like a thousand bear/wolverine/Silence of the Lambs Buffalo Bob eyes staring back at you. Woke up to some snow/ice on ground which melted away within hour of sunrise. Back out onto the foggy/rocky trail, although this day had more large pine areas with pine needles softening the path. Skirted the mountain side today and had views of Palmerton area for many miles. Steep descent with alot of hand work to get down to the parking lot. After Frank and Tony got back to their truck I was officially on my own to the George Outerbridge Shelter. Set up camp in the shelter, made a small fire, ate, and right to sleep.","Stealth Site Near Stempa Spring

JERMS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627832,"Up at sunrise with temps in low 30's. Weather was great until late afternoon. Went about 8 miles before I saw the first hiker near Bake Oven Knob. Stood near the edge on one graffiti ridden rock, battling my fear of heights or my fear of a sudden stop, and had my pic taken by a day hiker. Handful of people at Bake Oven Knob and then no more folks until I pull into camp much later. I was lucky to have dry rocks for the walks today to include Knife Edge. Stopped after 17 miles for water at Allentown Shelter and was able to load up from a stream about an inch and half deep. While filtering my water I checked the weather due to increasing clouds and dampness and saw it was supposed to rain pretty good throughout the night and saw the Eckville Shelter was a mere 7 more miles away and I had about 2 hours of daylight left. Although beat the temptation of an indoor shelter, one of a few along the trail, I decided to go for it. Past Dans Pulpit to find the iconic mailbox that has grown somewhat into a tree has been reclaimed by termites and gravity. Well I make it just at dusk to a misty-drizzly CLOSED Eckville Shelter. Closed Due to Virus said the sign. Well I set up my hammock across the street at the tenting area where two ""young ladies"" are busy smoking the Devils Lettuce at a picnic table while waiting for their ride. Apparently being one with nature and smoking her fine offerings doesn't mean you have to clean up your trash before you leave. Good Job Thelma and Louise. Anyway, camp was nice but the rain soon relinquished me to cook dinner under the tarp. No waking to hearing woodland creatures walking around tonight, just the sounds of steady rain on the tarp, until I roll right or left and the uncomfortable hammock kicks in. Great.","George Outerbridge Shelter

JERMS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627833,"Got moving around 7am to anything not under the tarp wet. Ankles are feeling the 24 mile day yesterday. Walked through the mist past some flowing streams with a goal of getting to Hamburg for resupply and a hotel stay(shower!). Past a group of people camping about a half mile from Eckville Shelter and that was it for the rest of the day for seeing people. With the exception of the first two nights with Frank and Tony I have seen no one else at shelters at night and only day hikers primarily near road crossings. Overcast day made for lots of fun on wet rocks and roots today. Nothing to see at any lookouts, which are not too frequent in Pa. Made it down to Route 61 in Port Clinton and walked over a mile to the Microtel in Hamburg for the night. Felt like a little kid getting the train engineer to hit the horn for me when I crossed the bridge(see video). Checked into my room, ordered a sandwich from local shop, then fifteen minutes later I ordered a pizza and ate all but one piece. I dried everything out all my gear in the room which looked like a garage sale. Decided I would resupply at WalMart and stop at Cabelas in the morning to switch to a tent and air mattress for better sleep.","Eckville Shelter

JERMS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627834,"Got my moneys worth at the hotel and stayed until 11am. Walked to Cabela's to find out the Commonwealth closed certain stores and Cabela's is one of them. Headed up to WalMart for resupply then to Wawa for one lunch hoagie and one for dinner. Walked back down busy Route 61 to go under bridge and back south. Noticed a broom on girder for bridge and then catch whiff of smoke under bridge. As my eyes adjust to darker area under the span I notice Mr. Down-On-His-Luck with all his worldly possessions near smoldering fire. He has got big backpack of mostly army surplus gear and is currently writing, hopefully not some manifesto on how out of shape middle aged hikers have ruined society. I say hello and he replies same in turn and makes mention of weather. Kinda say I have a long way to go to Georgia and continue on into Port Clinton. Now Port Clinton was one of the Trail Towns I wanted to experience; get a haircut, visit candy store, and break out my Life Member Volunteer Fireman card and mingle with other hose heads at the Port Clinton Fire Department. Ol' Covid-19 is having nothing to do with visitors. Well I meander through town, across tracks in front of approaching freight train, and up the steady climb out of town. I see two hikers right away and then no one else until I set up camp at the Eagles Nest Shelter. I read the shelter log and see Redbeard was here last year during the winter on his way to finish his ECT Thru Hike. Desperately I look for any Jim Beam he may have left behind but to no avail. Wind is up and temps are down. I get settled around 9pm and sleep pretty well until...Mr. Down-On-His-Luck shows up at 1:42am at the shelter. Even though its windy I am woken by the sound of approaching steps down the path and reach out to make sure the axe head left at shelter, and my nighttime sidekick, is still in reach. His headlamp shines on me, I say hello, and he asks if its okay he makes a fire. Well Mr. 6-04 with over a hundred pounds of gear, who just walked 9 miles in the dark and maintains residence currently under state highways, is told to have at it. I mention that I have the shelters axe next to me as more of sign I have something more than spraying fear like a skunk, and he replies no worries, ""I have a tomahawk"". He then walks off into the woods, chops away at some brush for 20 minutes, then makes the Great Chicago Fire. He talks for 2 minutes then starts snoring like he doesn't have a care in the world with this 10 foot high inferno raging. I stare at the ceiling until about 5:30 while Sasquatch chokes on air and backfires non-stop, and then break camp. Man I need a tent.","Hamburg

JERMS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627841,"Early start in the low 30's, some ice crystals in water bottle. Walked about an hour before I stopped for breakfast and instant Trader Joe's coffee. Stopped for a photo at the Fort Dietrich Snyder monument, and instead of going behind the monument and follow the white blaze south, I saw a white blaze to the right I guess for State Land Boundary and followed that for a wonderful one and a half mile loop in the wrong direction. Stopped by the Berks County High Point and took a snack break and ceremonial photo. Today was the busiest day for other hikers, especially near Route 501, probably 30-40 day hikers and with seeing ""Just Shawn(?)"" on the March 16th I have not met any other long distance hikers. Just Shawn(?) started from Georgia in mid January and was already finishing Pennsylvania when we saw him. His entire hike had to be frigid. Regan was meeting me today for a short hike and we met up near the Fisher Lookout, yelled at some dogs like a lunatic, and we made camp at the William Penn Shelter. After playing some double solitaire we called it a night until the 20 degree weather woke us up around 4:30am. After receiving notice from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy about leaving the trail a few days ago, and with many places closed, and a ride home with me, it was a good time to head home and hopefully be able to rejoin at a later date. We packed up in the dark and hiked the 2 miles back to her car. It was also going to be nice to rest my Achilles which had swollen after the 24 mile day a few days ago. Will keep you posted!","Eagles Nest Shelter

Parked at Swatara Gap and saw one car at parking area and swollen stream from recent rain. After walking under Interstate 81 bridge winding climb on path that was mostly a stream the first 1/4 mile. Drizzled off and on the entire day with temps around 50. Saw bear scat and one paw print. On high alert now. Mostly ridge walk with limited views during this stretch. Saw 1 day hiker in a kilt, three section hikers, and one thru, a flip flopper. The thru started in Shenandoahs but had to leave there due to closures. She reported the trail has been quiet but supportive by locals. Upon return to parking lot it was filled but everyone maintaining good distance. BTW, I hiked with my whole pack sans 4 day supply of food, taking her the whole way.","William Penn Shelter

Crossed first open field of trip and then up into woods. Snow flurries throughout the day with a couple squalls. Wind chills mostly in the high 20's. Made it to beaver dam crossing which put trail under foot plus of stanky water. Took socks off and crossed over 100 foot long dam in sneakers. Took a whole two steps before logs moved enough to send me over knee deep in 40 some degree water. Brisk baby. 3 minutes later I was on the other side with frozen feet. Put on fresh socks after quick wipe down and moved on. Saw maybe 2 dozen other hikers today before making camp next to a small stream. Babbling Brooks are great to mask the sounds of woodland creatures lurking in the night. Chilly 2nd first day.,"Swatara Gap

Day started off warmer than all of yesterday which apparently woke the local mosquito population. Very nicely maintained trail by the Susquehanna ATC. Decades of work must have been done to all the steps, islands, and stone bridges during this portion,  they are the standard when it comes to trail maintenance. Saw a couple day hikers after a few hours and met one LASHER(Long Ass Section Hiker) today. Saw several male Scarlet Tanagers today, one deer, and the tail end of a couple snakes going under rocks. Made camp at Peter's Mountain Shelter, which can probably hold 2 dozen campers between both floors. Getting water from downhill spring was perfectly described in shelter log as ""Walking down into Mordor"". Quarter mile of straight up and down stone steps. It must have taken years for the Susquehanna ATC to have constructed the steps. Warm and dry at 1174 feet.

Those dang Trail Gnomes were back at it sharpening the rocks for one last attack before I hit the Cumberland Valley. Slow going down into Duncannon. Saw first snake across trail, right after some teenage kid ran passed it and it never moved until I probably activated some unknown defense mechanism I wasn't aware of and it slithered away as I almost stepped on it. Regular garden type but still when you dont know it's there it's a King Cobra for a split second. Nice brisk breeze crossing the Susquehanna River into Duncannon. Local supermarket offered ride after I I resupplied back into town, actually they came looking for me as I approached saying someone saw me and they contacted staff a hiker was approaching. Duncannon is so hiker friendly with folks posting their phone numbers offering help. When the hostel in town didn't answer the phone I called Trail Angel Mary who gave me another number(personal cell of hostel owner), and even offered to let me stay at her house where another hiker had grabbed some space. Stayed at the Kind Of Outdoorsy Hostel and got a bunk, shower, and did laundry nearby. They have fresh linens, some shower supplies, and clothes to wear if you dont have spares while doing laundry. Stopped by the closed Doyle Hotel,  one of the icons of the trail and saw the readily identifiable BTPD patch dead center behind the bar. It was a couple years ago me and Bremmer paid a visit during cigar weekend and left the patch, man they treated us like family. Had hostel all to myself and snored to drown out the passing trains during the night. Saw one French Canadian thru hiker today, several day hikers.","Peter's Mountain Shelter

Still amazed at all the effort put into placing stone steps by trail volunteers. Couple nice views and the first field walking of the trip for me. Also awesome hiking weather, 40 to 50 degrees and mostly sunny. Passed a few thru hikers and all were in good spirits. Made it to Darlington Shelter after 11 or so miles by 1PM, my MPH are growing but I have to ease into the bigger miles or risk injury. A section hiking couple lay claim to the shelter with their dalmatian until the rocks cut one of the canines pads putting an end to their yearly hike. The rocks are wobbly, crooked, slippery, and jagged throughout and any one of them can bring down years of planning. I moved into the shelter and had one of my better nights sleeping even with wildlife waltzing about the brush. Enjoyed a cigar with some filtered creek water to celebrate my 54th year.","Duncannon

Then along Conodoquinet Creek and some long boardwalks through the marsh. Some more farm field walks and into Boiling Springs. Quick resupply at Karns and then I spent the night at Lisa's Hostel. 25 bucks for a bunk, shower, laundry, and All You Can Eat grilled cheese. Great host. My ""cell mate "" tonight was Light Walker, a section hiker. I learned where the Trail Gnomes go if they don't really contribute, like eat rocks instead of ruining hikers shoes. Apparently they go on light duty for a bit and if they don't get with the program they become Steelers garden gnomes. Go Browns!!","Darlington Shelter

Lots of dry stretches today with one good view from Chimney Rocks. End of the day Cousin John picked me up at Route 16 for an indoor stay, resupply, takeout, and music from Nick. Met 2 time Boston Marathoner Rocky Road and left a diddy in his head that wont leave mine the last couple days.

Todays disappointing realization was climbing a boulder strewn trail in rain to awesome view at High Rock, to learn a road takes you right to the foot of the lookout. Cheaters, I earned the view. Couple reprieves from stone path with farm field walks, beautiful views from Black Rock Cliff. 20 miles were a bit much on the feet, hiker hobble last mile or so.

Across busy I70 and up to the original Washington's Monument. Some decent views but pretty cloudy. Maryland State Parks opening slowly. State park crossings usually mean wide, soft, and level paths. With exception of Washington Monument only one other view.

Took off rain jacket and used umbrella and felt so much better, now I need to upgrade to nice lightweight hiking umbrella. Local picked me up while walking and gave me the 3 mile ride back to trailhead. Thanks my friend. Low clouds made for no views into Shenandoah until 3 or so.

Day hikers out in droves with their wonderful fresh laundry aromas contradicting my established thru hiker scent, which makes them moving from view points to my advantage. Many views today and at elevations up to 3837 feet, some plants just blooming. Nice weather coupled with spectacular views made the miles float by, until my feet reminded me to cool my jets.

As usual in the hills no cell service for my boy to come rescue me from Virginia Tech, so slowly start moving south.

She and her boyfriend are traveling east coast and she is a physical trainer. I love the reactions of those who are educated in health, see my injury, and instinctively give the ""not good"" wince. She inspects, then wraps my ankle, and he gives much needed water. When a stranger without hesitation tends to an injured thru hikers smelly foot, that my friend is true Trail Angel. I meander back along the trail and take in as many of the limited views that remain. I pass by the recently posted signs warning of bear activity in area and make a conscious effort to walk quietly in hope of running into one. Not lucky today but do walk along with a rabbit and a few deer. Due to no hunting they are not skittish around humans.

Few dozen day hikers on the 5 mile hike to Sunfish Pond then just me and the chipmunks. Taking a much slower pace and doing my best taking a break every hour or near a view. Elevations go just over 1500 feet today with nice ridge walking. Come across a copperhead snake with its main body arched on the trail which brings me to a sudden stop. I immediately step back with my right foot but my heel is against a tall rock and I go right onto my back while Mr. Copperhead quickly slithers between my right and the bushes making his getaway. Now that my heart rate in cresting 400 beats a minute I continue down the trail to find water. Of course the water source is named Rattlesnake Spring which does absolutely nothing to stop me from seeing every branch and root become a potential venomous reptile. Meet up with fellow thru hiker Cyborg at water source and make plans for camp. Meander past several less than inviting spots before setting up tents about a mile past a beaver pond, where the half dozen beavers like to slap their tails against water to warn you to keep moving.

Made it to camp by 5ish where Early Riser was the sole occupant. Had the place to ourselves until one hiker arrived at dusk. Coyotes about 100 feet away serenaded us and this was the first time hearing them so close and being at ease, Early Riser on the other hand...","Seth Warner Shelter

JERMS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644297,"Early Riser living up to her name and out before me. SOBO bubble is here and on the move. Lunch break at Glastenberry Tower had me only brave enough to make it to the 5th level which barely got me a view at tree top level. Snowmobile trails in the area and seeing the height of some of the boulders on the trails are a good indicator that Vermont may get a little bit more snow than Jersey. Some coyote music and a few deer made up the wildlife today. Made it to camp for a big 17 mile day. Some good camp talk with Torpedo, Firefly, Garlic, Early Riser, and couple others before retiring at dusk. Quite a few deer throughout the night to keep me company.","Melville Nauheim Shelter

JERMS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644298,"Out of camp and redirecting Torpedo onto his southbound course within a 100 feet of camp, making the same mistake we all have from time to time of heading the opposite way. Early Riser and I exchange responsibility on clearing the cobwebs the first couple miles until she leaves the trail for some R&R. Only mountain views are obtained today by climbing Stratton Tower if your don't have fear of heights, which for me means no views. Make it to Stratton Pond for lunch and take a dip to rinse some sweat. Water was clear and amazingly warm for a New England pond. I was in awe as one of the thru hikers swimming was howling with a coyote across the pond. The coyote comes to shore to investigate across from us for a moment before running off. Made it to William Douglas Shelter, a lengthy .4 miles off trail, where I have my first night of solitude this week.","Story Spring Shelter
