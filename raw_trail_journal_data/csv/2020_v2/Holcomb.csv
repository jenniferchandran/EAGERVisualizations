Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519624,"I have been resting my bones from my 2015 attempt of an AT thru hike. I knew the AT was going to be tough and challenging for a 70 year old, but I must say that it was much more difficult than I had anticipated! I started at Springer Mt on Feb. 26,2015. My first night out at Hawk Mt., it snowed 9 inches! Hiking 3 days through this wet snow to Neel Gap, my toes got frost bitten! Had to head back home for 3 weeks of therapy. Three weeks later (March 20), I returned to Neel Gap to continue my trek. The hiking went well all the way to Hot Springs (mile 274.5). The last hike into Hot Springs, however, was an ill advised fast 23 mile hike on a sunny day. I developed a stress fracture on my left shin. I rested 2 days and still could not walk on it. Home again, this time for 9 months. Since November 1st, I have been daily hiking the Anchorage hills and/or working out at a health club, getting in much better shape than last year. I hate not accomplishing something I set out to do, so yes, the AT mountains are calling me back!",,Summary of Beginning,"Jan 14, Thu",0
Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519786,"I grew up in the small town of Canisteo, New York. After graduating from college in 1967, I was offered a two year contract to teach school in Point Hope, Alaska.   I fell in love with Alaska and ended up teaching in Bush Alaska for 30 years. From 1982 to 1994, my wife and I raised and raced sled dogs in Nome, Alaska. We ran many short and middle distant races. In 1991 and 1992, I ran the 1049 mile Iditarod sled dog race. There were temperatures that reached -40 degrees during the race each year, but never got frostbite feet until I went to Georgia to hike the AT!! My wife of 40 years and I live in Anchorage now. I have always loved the outdoors and a challenge. The Appalachian Trail is calling again. Hope to be heading back to Hot Springs with much warmer foot gear in about a month, to continue my trek where I left off last year.",,A little history,"Jan 18, Mon",0
Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520246,"I have noticed that many hikers abruptly end their hike due to an injury. Unfortunately, I was one of those casualties last year! It has taken me nine months to fully recover from all of my injuries. The many rocks, roots and mountains to cross demand constant concentration on your next step. Falling hard is something everyone does, some more frequent than others. Many times, hikers get in a hurry to get to a shelter, make it to a town or to catch or stay up with another hiker, which greatly increases a risk of injury. Everyone has a different pace, but it is important to find a comfortable and safe pace. Happy hiking and stay safe!",,Injuries,"Jan 19, Tue",0
Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520459,"Some hikers average 5 to 8 miles a day, some average 18 or more miles a day and most AT hikers average something in between. I feel there are three main factors that determine how far a hiker usually travels a day. 1 - A hiker's physical condition. The better condition one is in, the easier the hike. Hiking up the 6 mile climb out of Nantahala Outdoor Center last March, a hiker went by me like a bullet (his trail name was appropriately Bullet)! It was about 25 degrees out and he had on gym shorts and running shoes. He was a thru hiker hiking with his Father (trail name Magnum). They were both pretty fast hikers, but Bullet flew up those mountains and obviously was in incredible physical condition. 2 - Another factor is how many hours a day, a person is on the trail. I would usually leave an hour before Bullet and Magnum, they would pass me in a few hours and I would usually arrive at a campsite a couple hours after them. By spending about 3 more hours on the trail than them, I was able to stay with them from Blue Mountain (Mile 50) to Fontana Dam (Mile 166). After a few 20 mile days, I had to take a 0 day and they flew on down the trail. 3 - The third main factor is how heavy one's backpack is. I camped on top of Wildcat Mountain (7 miles North of Neel Gap) with a couple guys just out of college the night of March 20th. They were having a great time averaging 5 miles a day. Their packs weighed 50 pounds each. They even were packing camp chairs! A heavier load usually slows hikers down, especially going up those mountains. Many items are sent home after a hiker takes advantage of the many free shakedowns that are available at most outfitters.",,Daily Mileage,"Jan 30, Sat",0
Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520790,"Those who post on Trailjournals.com are a very small fraction of all the section and thru hikers hiking on the AT. A hiker sees new hikers every day. Most of the time, hikers are very friendly. They respect one another for enduring the same strenuous hikes day after day and many times become instant friends. A hiker usually hikes alone, but often stops and takes a snack or lunch break with others. Campsites and shelters become popular gathering spots after 4 pm. Campfires are often started that draw hikers in to warm up and visit. Hikers are also busy at this time cooking, setting up camp and checking their AT guides, many times discussing the next day's hike. The AT provides a very special and unique social life that hikers enjoy and treasure. Just being out there creates a camaraderie amongst hikers. Advise: Take pictures to remember fellow hikers and special locations!",,AT Social Life,"Feb 06, Sat",0
Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522040,"The outdoors lures many people into hiking. Once a person starts appreciating the solitude and the nature that one experiences, the trail starts calling one back. Month long hiking adds a whole new dimension to this appreciation! Hiking long distances has its challenges. It is not only physically demanding, but the trail will reveal a person's resolve, their mental toughness and their true colors. The time and experiences on the trail provides an opportunity for a hiker to reflect, not only on one's character, but also on one's life. It can be a time of much soul searching. Priorities are clarified. Finishing a long distant hike gives one an incredible feeling of accomplishment, but many times reveals the direction the hiker should eventually go.""The world is round and the place which may seem like the end may also be the beginning."" - Ivy Baker Priest",,Reflection,"Feb 28, Sun",0
Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522277,"If I make all my plane and bus connections, I hope to be in Hot Springs, NC (Where I left off last year) by Saturday, March 5th. Many of my friends think I am crazy! This makes me sometimes question my sanity! I tell myself, 'I love the outdoors and I love a challenge, is this what is calling me back to the trail.' It does and in addition, I start remembering the spectacular views after climbing and hiking the ridge lines of the AT. I start remembering the calming effect of hiking along a quiet lake or the sound of hiking or camping next to a fast moving creek. I start remembering the peacefulness of hiking through the woods and being surrounded by nature. The flowers, the trees, the birds, the wildlife is everywhere. All these experiences become a part of me forever! Every day on this distant hike, I will be rewarded with new and interesting trails, scenery, and challenges. Yes, I will have to endure some very difficult days, but by doing so, the beauty and emotions I will experience will be more than worth the effort!! More than anything else, I hope that I can be an inspiration to the less active to become more active no matter one's age.",,WHY???,"Mar 02, Wed",63
Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522640,"After 8 hours on planes and 7 hours on the Greyhound buses, I finally arrived in Ashville, NC. I set up my backpack, and hiked 2 miles thru Ashville to route 25 and held up my sign for HOT SPRINGS. After an hour and a thousand cars zooming by, I called on my Guardian Angel for help. In just a couple minutes, a car honked and pulled over. James was his name and a former thru hiker who lives in Ashville. I ask him how far he was going and he said I 'm taking you the whole way! My first trail magic and I haven't even started hiking yet! He went over 60 miles out of his way for this very impressive gesture! Photo of James and his dog. Notice his license plate!

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523536,"Departed camp at 8 am - As I climbed Unaka, I started to create a poem about AT hikers:
Hikers in the woods,
They don't mind the pain.
Hikers in the woods,
Are they really sane?
Climbing up the mountains,
With their worn tired feet.
Moving very steady,
With a rhythmic beat,
Hikers in the Woods,
They don't mind the weather,
The journey is what brings them joy.
Miles and miles bring many smiles,
HIKERS IN THE WOODS!
Arrived at Clyd Smith shelter to find 2 brothers, Cameron and Dayton on a Spring break hike and 3 section hikers from Brooksville, Florida. Two camp fires going tonight. To bed at camper midnight! Picture is at the top of Unaka Mt (Foggy - thick evergreen - 5180 ft)","Campsite - Mile 355.4

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523546,"As I left Clyd Smith shelter at day break, it started raining. My goal was to get over Rohn Mt. Rohn Mountain is one of the highest Mountains on the AT! As I climbed, it started pouring and the wind started howling. The gusts were exceeding 40 knots as I neared the top (6212 ft). It was a little scary! Right at the top I met another hiker (Backtrack) going Southbound. He was a thru hiker last year and was doing a long section hike to Gatlinberg. The chill factor was in the 30s so we both needed to keep moving. When I reached Carver's Gap (Mile 379), there was a wind tunnel blowing at least 50 knots! It lasted for two miles over Jane Bald and beyond. A very challenging 15.5 mile hike in rain, thick fog and very cold wind. When I arrived at Over the Mountain Shelter, Peach, a Southbound thru hiker arrived at the very same time. Peach had encountered the same intense weather for 18 miles from Mountaineer Shelter. As we walked toward this very unique shelter (Barn turned into a shelter), the fog lifted and blue sky appeared. Also appearing was 'Moonpie' (A gal who helps maintains this part of the trail), with soda and delicious moonpies. She visited with us for an hour and we graciously thanked her over and over! I have been sleeping reasonably well in shelters or my tent. The only significant thing that has happened in my dreams is a nightmare that occurs occasionally in my tent. I wake up finding myself about tearing my tent down fighting some Appalachian creature that is attaching me. No other camper has seemed to notice this commotion in the middle of the night or at least hasn't mentioned it! Back to Peach. Peach is from near Dallas, Tx and we somehow got a campfire going with damp wood and talked non-stop for hours! Picture is ""Moonpie"" in front of the shelter. ??","Clyde Smith Shelter

He was going to do two 25 milers, putting him in Erwin in two days. No problem, he already has his hiking legs. Peach would be leaving the empty shelters and be heading into the masses hiking northward. I only had a 10 miler. I was anxious to get to Mt Harbour Hostel and get a subway, but decided to really slow down and take it all in. The robins and many other birds were singing away all morning. It turned out to be one of the most enjoyable hikes I have ever taken. Not a cloud in the sky, warm and a slight breeze. The climb up the Hump Mountains took me up to 5500 ft and a spectacular 360 degree view. It was breathtaking. The bald at the top went on for a good 3 miles. It was nice to be out of the woods for a while. What a contrast from yesterday!! I arrived at the hostel about 1pm. Shannon, the host has a nice hostel. Took a shower, did laundry and hitched a ride to Subway! Restful day and planning the hike ahead. There is another picture of the Mt Harbour Hostel under photos","Over the Mountain Shelter

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523750,"Five and a half miles into my hike, I saw a blue blaze for water. It was warm and after a long 1000 foot climb and about out of water, I turned and followed a very short distance to a spring with a nice little water fall to fill my water bottle. I drank about a pint of this ice cold water through my filter and filled my bottle again. Just as I turned and started back toward the trail, two retired couples were walking toward me. They said, ""aren't you going a little farther and see the waterfalls? It's only around the corner."" I was tired and said no thanks and started back to the trail. After getting back on the AT, I went about 100 yards and I remembered my wife reminding me to slow down and enjoy your hike! It brought me to a screeching halt! I did an about face and went back to Jones Fall and had my most cooling and enjoyable break so far. There were about 8 day hikers who had hiked for hours just to get up here and I was only 50 feet away on my AT hike! I had a pleasant conversation with Kim. Kim and her husband had lived and worked in Louisiana all their lives. When they retired, they said to themselves, 'Let's move to the Appalachian Mountains'. Now they have become day hikers with unlimited choices for their hikes and loving their new life styles. The millions of people that live near the Appalachian Trail are blessed with all the different trails and mountains to climb. I run into many day and section hikers every day, especially on the weekends. After a 14 mile hike today, I camped and set up my tent next to a large cascading stream. The sound of it was refreshing and I slept soundly all night.","Mt Harbor Hostel - Route 19E

I really want to get into Damascus before this cold front goes through. I moved along nicely for the first 10 miles until I hit Laurel Falls Park. It started with a beautiful groomed trail, then climbing down hundreds of huge stone steps really slowed me down. What a beautiful park and waterfalls. I was in awe of it all. The park was a welcome little adventure from walking in the woods. Thank you AT for taking us through this beautiful place. When I eventually made it to 427.1 (Route 321), I hitched a ride 2.6 miles into Hampton to stay at the Braemar Castle Hostel. Took a long hot shower, ate a fantastic prime rib sandwich at a local place down the street and resupplied at Brown's store. Dutton Brown, owner of the hostel, is a nice man and owns the grocery store across the street. I highly recommend this place. It is large, has a great history and very clean.

For the next 14 miles the trail followed this ridge line, straight North. The previous 350 miles, the AT would curve around mountains heading East - West - South and eventually North, making one wonder if little progress was being made, moving toward Maine! As I hiked along this welcomed straight line, many times I could look down on either side of this very high ridge and see lush valleys of green pastures, lakes and towns. It was sort of like flying in a small plane in super slow motion looking down at the terrain. At the same time, the trail going straight gave me a feeling that I was making real progress on my trek Northbound. It was a long, but very beautiful and most enjoyable 23 mile hike. Did not see a hiker all day! When I arrived at Double Springs Shelter, found out that this 30+ mile ridge line hiking trail from Hampton to Damascus is know to hikers as the 'Tenessee Turnpike'! Already at the shelter was thru hikers Crash and Seeker and Seeker's friend Adam (hiking a few days with Seeker), had all the wood collected for a campfire.

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523988,"Crash woke up at 6 AM and enthusiastically announced that it was 'hiker time'!! I crawled out of my bag (Temp 40) and meticulously started my routine of carefully putting on my toe sock liners, massaging the feet a bit, putting on the outer socks, then the insoles into the shoes that were drying out overnight in the sleeping bag. Once the shoes are on, then the light weight gators were put on very carefully. Climbing out of the shelter, I go into the woods a ways and find a tree to take care of nature. Next is retrieving the food bag from where it was hung from a tree branch (Discouraging any bear that might have food on his/her mind). The morning routine of stuffing the down bag away continues, placing it in the bottom of the backpack and then carefully placing each item into the backpack in the same order as every morning. I always have my snacks and water prepared the night before for the next day's hike. It is all a ritual that takes about 45 minutes. Crash and I leave with our headlamps on at 6:45am. We took a break at mile 4 where there was a piped spring and a picnic table and another snack break at the next shelter (mile 8). This experience of hiking with someone was new for me. Up to this point, I have been hiking virtually solo. The next 10 miles, we did not stop because we wanted to get to the PO before it closed. Crash is a little faster than I. He is 64 and from New Hampshire. He has done the AT about 4 times and has a wealth of info on where things are on the AT. I first ran into him 70 miles back in Erwin at Uncle Johnnys. He does a lot of slack packing. He hires a driver to take him 20+ miles North into the mountains, then hikes back South (Usually downhill) to the same hostel with a 5 to 8 pound pack. The next time I ran into Crash was 3 days ago going through Laurel Falls Park. He's heading downhill Southbound with a 5 pound pack and I am heading uphill with my 20 pound pack. I am thinking maybe I should get smart and start doing some slack packing!! I was happy to catch up with Crash at double springs shelter after my 23 miler two nights ago. He is the one that told me about this Hiker Inn where we are now staying and taking a zero day. Great place to stay! Very clean and Quiet. It is close to everything in Damascus.

Our shuttle (Woodchuck from Woodchuck Hostel) took us up to Around 5000 feet to mile 493.1. We started hiking at 7:45 am. The temperature was 30 and frost everywhere. We moved rather quickly because it was cold, it was downhill, our packs only weighed about 10 pounds and we wanted to get to MoJos to eat dinner before it closed at 5! After nine miles (about 11:30 am), we stopped at Lost Mountain Shelter just long enough to inhale our half subway sandwiches that we had bought the night before. We continued hiking through the woods and eventually hit the Creeper Trail. The Creeper Trail is an old railroad bed from 1900 that has been transformed into a beautiful bike and hiking trail (The Creeper is a total of 17 miles of gentle slope downhill with rapids that parallel it). It was an exhilarating experience, hiking along the roaring sound of this fast moving water. The last 10 miles of the Creeper Trail going into Damascus crosses 20 bridges over this cascading stream! We continued at a brisk pace and accomplished all of our goals for the day, including a great meal at MoJos! We have decided to take another zero in Damascus because tomorrow's chill factor on top of Mt Rodgers (Virgonia's highest peak) is suppose to be single digits so we will attempt Mt Rodgers on Tuesday when the temperature is forecast to be in the 40s.

The wind was blowing 25 knots and gusts up to 40 for most of the 19 mile hike. There was a 4 mile stretch that went down and out of the wind when I stopped and had my subway sandwich that I had purchased the night before. Back up on the ridge, the wind continued to blow, but the view looking down on either side of the ridge featured farms and lush green farmland far below. I arrived at Trent Grocery at 5 pm and Crash was there. They had a room with 2 beds, a bathroom and a washer and dryer for $ 45. that Crash and I split. The hot shower was great and we washed all our clothes. Trent Grocery is 12 miles away from the nearest town, had a gas pump, a fast food portion that served breakfast, lunch and dinner.

This morning Crash and I slack packed up the AT 2000 feet along side one of these mountain streams. It was a wonderful way to start our 20 mile hike. It also amazes me how much water can flow out of these springs at the top of these mountains. Once we reached the top of the ridge line, the wind was howling and gusting up to at least 50 knots. Thank goodness for gravity or we would have blown off this very high ridge. The views again were quite spectacular. Our light packs allowed us to move swiftly and we covered the 20 mile stretch in 7 hours. We attended the Thursday night feast and the live 'Ho Down' music at the MacArthur Inn lobby tonight!

Thick fog and cold winds to start with, then cold howling winds on the ridges. Next came the rain. The last two miles, loud thunder, lightning and pounding hail!!

Three more miles across corn fields, we arrived at Boiling Springs, a very popular fishing community. Fishermen everywhere! We stopped for breakfast at 10:30 am at a coffee shop close to the trail. After an hour rest, we continued eight more miles down the AT, over more flat farmland to Carlisle, Pa. We checked in at the Days Inn (Just a few hundred yards, west from the trail, down route 11). For hikers behind me, cross over route 11 then immediately go down a little bank to Route 11. We enjoyed an excellent meal at a very popular Middlesex Diner (Open 24 hours!) right next to the hotel. The restaurant has a large selection of food, serves large portions and has excellent service. We are definitely going back two more times tomorrow!! We are taking a well deserved zero tomorrow to rest our weary bodies and add calories. It's our first zero since Front Royal, about 160 miles back. It is forecast to rain all day tomorrow so we will be happy to be dry for a second day in a row. This valley that we are crossing is a flat 14 miles of lush green farmland that is the easiest hike on the AT. On Monday we have four more miles of flatness that will bring us up to the mountains.

I left the Day's Inn at 7 am after some continental oatmeal. All of today's 17 mile hike was in thick fog. There were a couple climbs, but a fairly easy hike. Pennsylvania's section of the AT is known for the zillion of rocks that cover the trail. I was introduced to a bit of this today.

The trail took me across a long bridge over the Susquehanna River. Crossing over made me think back to my Great Great Grandparents, William and Hannah Griffee Jack. For 3 months around 1820, with the help of two oxen and an Indian guide, they followed the trails along side the Susquehanna from Cecil County, Maryland to Steuben County in New York. They settled near Cameron, NY, where they built a home, farmed and raised 10 children. Steuben County is where my Mom and Dad, Grandpa and Grandma and Great Grandpa and Grandma, all raised their families as well. I continued to think that the toughness of hiking the Appalachian Trail is nothing compared to the many hardships they must have endured back then. It all makes me appreciate the luxuries we take for granted today. The trail is hard, but thinking about all of this helps me to keep going. After crossing the bridge, the trail immediately took me into the woods and up a steep 1000 foot climb. Once on top of the ridge line, I was not surprised to find another long Boulder maze to maneuver through. Eventually the trail became friendlier. An eleven mile hike put me at Peters Mountain Shelter at 2:30 pm. The next shelter is 18 miles away. Too far away to go any farther.

After twelve tough miles of steep ups and downs, we were rewarded at the top of Bear Mountain with soda and snack vending machines! Bear Mountain is a very popular Mountain to climb. Tourists may also drive up to the top on a paved road. There was a stone lookout tower with spectacular views in every direction. Crash, Bananas, Hap and I all relaxed on a bench and enjoyed conversation and a wonderful break. We had camped with Bananas and Hap the past two nights. Hap’s two week long hike would end here and his wife was soon picking him up.     Leaving the top of Bear Mountain, I was very impressed with very large stone steps that a company meticulously had positioned all the way down the mountain. Crash informed me that it had taken them three years to complete. We took our time going down admiring the incredible physical labor that had gone into this construction project. At the bottom, people were everywhere enjoying a day at Bear Mountain Park.     We continued to move slowly through this very massive park filled with picnic tables, benches and large trees. The AT not only went right through the park, but went right through the Bear Mountain Zoo as well. Compared to the climbing up and down mountains filled with rocks and boulders that we had spent the last couple months enduring, this was a most enjoyable stroll.        Near the end of the park, we were rewarded again to find an ice cream vending machine. My favorite ice cream bar is an ice cream sandwich. I was overjoyed to see that one of the choices was a jumbo ice cream sandwich! I could not put my $3. in fast enough! Instead, out comes a bright red and yellow sponge-bob pop cycle! Every time Crash and Bananas looked over at me eating this colorful delight, they would burst out laughing!     Feeling rested, we leisurely continued hiking over the Hudson River crossing the Bear Mountain Bridge. Far below we could see and hear trains coming and going on both sides of the river. After crossing, we had to shift gears for another steep climb. On top of the ridge, the trail became smooth and we covered the last six miles to US route 9 very quickly. There was a very busy 24 hour gas station and convenient store right next to the trail. Several hikers were there including Tenderfoot, who we had not seen for the past 660 miles!     We spent 30 festive minutes at the store reminiscing and chowing down. Crash’s son showed up who lives in the area. Crash was going to spend a few days with him. After introductions, it was time for Crash and I to say our goodbyes.

It had been a long 21 mile hike, but a most enjoyable one. For the past six days, I have decided that my AT section hike will end this year when I reach the train station in Pawling, New York.

For the next several miles, we enjoyed each other's company. We reminisced about the 1000+ miles we had hiked, camped, laughed and basically lived our AT experiences together for over two months. I would not have lasted this long without his companionship, his enthusiasm for hiking and his wealth of information about the AT. We also discussed, for the final time, my decision to leave the trail. He finally said to me, ""Whatever you decide, will be the right decision"". He could have made me feel guilty by talking me into staying, but chose to let it be my decision. Crash seems to love the challenges of the Appalachian Trail which has been proven by the many times he has thru hiked it. I on the other hand, am very satisfied and proud with enduring 2/3 of the AT. This includes 275 miles I logged in 2015. Thank you Crash for your friendship, the memories we will treasure and be with us forever. Twelve miles into our hike he reached his rental car and we shook hands for good. I rested at the RPH shelter for about an hour and then decided to hike 9 more miles to the next shelter.

The first challenge was a nice little steep rock climb up to the summit of Lions Head at mile 1502.1! At mile 5, a climb up popular Bear Mt., provided some incredible views of the surrounding countryside. I noticed most of today's hikers were found around Bear Mountain. It was a busy place. Coming down Bear Mt at mile 1506.4, I came to the Sages Ravine. The water was raging down this gorge and a rocky trail followed the ravine tor about a half mile. After eventually crossing over this cascading stream, there was a long gradual climb up Race Mountain. Hikers are rewarded with spectacular 360 degree views at the top of Race Mountain. A gradual descent off Race Mountain led me to a very long steep climb up Mount Everett. It was a very enjoyable, and at the same time, this hike tired this old boy out! BTW, my Fitbit recorded over 44,000 steps today! I guess there were many baby steps going up and coming down some of those steep slopes!","Salisbury

I looked closer and noticed this little mole had tiny legs. I had a tick embedded in me. The angle made it difficult to get out. My anxiety skyrocketed. I went downstairs to show Venessa. She pulled it right out. It was not a deer tick! I have been super careful, tucking my pant legs into my socks and the bottom of my shirt tucked into my pants. I will have to start putting more lavender and lemongrass oil on me, all my clothes and my backpack. I am thinking that I might have picked it up yesterday on my backpack, layed the backpack on my bed and the tick from there somehow found me. I am really paranoid now. I feel OK and there is no inflammation nor large circles developing. I think I am safe. Venessa shuttled me back to the trail. The hike was an easy eight mile hike. My dentist (retired now) was due to arrive in Sheffield at 12:30 pm by Peter Pan Bus from New York City. I arrived there just in time to watch him get off the bus. Doc had called me about a month ago and asked me if he could join me on the AT. He hiked 500 miles on the Camino last year so I said sure. We then hiked over to Jess Treat where we had reservations for the night. Great hospitality there. Doc and I went over to a the Marketplace Cafe for lunch and I experienced an incredible roast beef sandwich with carmalized onions and peppers and horseradish spread on multigrain bread. Doc ordered a chicken curry wrap. The sandwiches were so good that we both had them make duplicates, wrap them to go so we could take them with us for lunch on the AT tomorrow. They then put them in cute little brown paper bags. Jess allowed us to put them in her refrigerator to keep them fresh for tomorrow.

We could not believe we had not remembered to pack them. We scrounged some boring trail snacks and were on our way. The rain did not help our disgust! Two miles later we crossed Route 23. I pulled my cell phone out and called Kai and asked him if he could shuttle our sandwiches to route 23. He said he would be there in 15 minutes!

Also next to the Shamrock is an incredible eatery named Jacob's Pub that Doc and I have heard so much about.  Halfway into the hike we summitted Warner Hill.  There were large smooth rocks to sit on, a nice breeze and a 360 degree view.  A perfect place to relax and fuel up with some trail mix and cliff bars.  We also were respectfully admiring Mt Greylock (Mass highest peak), knowing we would be summiting it in a couple days.

I thought about it as I ate some granola, sausage, cheese and some almonds.  I first stuffed my sleeping bag in it's waterproof sac and pushed it to the bottom of my backpack.  Next into the backpack went everything else.  I placed my waterproof pack cover over my backpack and on went my raincoat.  The only thing left to put into my backpack was my tent.  It was time to crawl out and make quick work of dismantling it in the rain.  I shook as much water off the tent as I could, stuffing it into it's waterproof sac and then into the top of my backpack.  I soon found myself hiking!  The first challenge today was a very steep slippery two mile climb up Barren Mountain.  Then came a challenging four mile steep descent over slippery boulders, roots and mud.  At the bottom (Six miles into the hike), I came to a frightful cascading Long Pond Creek water crossing.  It was scary!  Three strong hikers from Kentucky who were also doing the 100 Mile Wilderness Southbound, had just finished crossing as I arrived.  I thought 'Great, someone to rescue me if I fall in'!  I did not hesitate.  My hiking shoes were already soaking wet, so I left them on as I slowly started across.  I moved one step at a time, trying to steady myself with my duct-taped poles.  The high water was raging and the noise of the moving water was deafening!  Half way across, the water was just above the top of my legs.  I was then facing upstream, lost my balance and momentarily fell in soaking myself to my shoulders!  I luckily was able to regain my balance and continued very slowly across without further trouble.  What a relief to get across!  Just as I finished crossing, the sun came out along with a slight warming breeze.  I started unpacking the entire contents of my backpack, hanging and spreading things out to dry.   The three hikers from Kentucky passed me, wished me luck and continued down the trail Southbound.  I was exhausted after a very stressful six miles of very challenging terrain.  I snacked, rested and let things dry out for two hours!  After packing up, I super appreciated the sunny conditions, especially after enduring two days and nights of miserable wet conditions.

SLOW to her meant 50 MPH through these zones! I was wondering if the dangerous hiking section we were skipping would have been safer than this  terrifying ride. After 25 miles, my knuckles were white, but we miraculously arrived at the Rattle River Hostel, which is located right on the AT. Today and tomorrow we will be allowing our bodies to recover from the brutal trails of Maine and the ride over from Andover! Funny thing happened today. I met this gal who is hiking Northbound named Charmin. As we chatted, she asked me my trailname. When I told her Holcomb, she said, I thought I recognized you. Last year near Falls Village, Connecticut, she was hiking Southbound as I was hiking Northbound, we had stopped and chatted for about fifteen minutes before going on our way. I did a journal piece on her and posted her picture on my April 19, 2017 page. Check it out. Crazy coincidence! This year she is doing a Northbound section as her goal is to eventually finish the AT.","South Arm Road - Andover

At our age, any more miles we complete, we are considering extra credit! The eight mile hike today took us eight hours! The terrain was steep and difficult, especially up and over 4000 foot Mount Moriah. The temperature was 90 and the high humidity made the climbs a lot more exhausting. The highlight today were some spectacular views of the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Tomorrow will be another very challenging hike to the Carter Notch Hut.

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601873,"Today marks 13 days without a fall and that breaks my record of 12! Hopefully, I can extend the record in the days ahead! Seeker and I knew we had a tough hike ahead of us today because it had taken two hikers at Imp Shelter, 8 hours yesterday, to hike the same 8 mile section we were about to tackle. We decided to get an early start and leave at daybreak at 6 am. A mile into the hike, we came to an incredibly steep, dangerous boulder climb up North Carter Mountain. To add to the challenge, it started raining, the wind started howling, and we were in thick fog. The steep wet, slippery boulder climbing was very scary at times, especially with our 20 pound packs. We were each carrying an extra 5 pounds of water since there were no water sources for this route. The climbs were tedious and nerve racking! There were three more climbs up Middle Carter Mt, Mt Hight and finally Carter Dome. The last mile today took us down a steep dangerous 1500 foot drop that took us an hour to descend! We were tired but so relieved to have arrived at the Hut. We checked in at 2 pm and immediately were served some delicious potato soup and coffee cake. We went to our bunkhouse and unpacked, cleaned up a bit and then collapsed on our bunks for a much needed rest. The Hut has a capacity for 40 guests, but tonight there was only six of us. Three of the guests were nurses from New York City that had just graduated from nursing school, doing some day hikes in the White Mountains. The all you can eat dinner was served at 6pm. First came some delicious tomato soup with fresh warm home made bread. The next course was an excellent salad. The third course was a delicious pasta dinner with cooked peas as a side. For dessert, peach pie and coffee. The three person staff waited on us non stop and provided us some after dinner entertainment as well! A wonderful ending to a tough day of hiking!Sent from my iPhone","Imp Lean-to

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601889,"My shoulders often ache after the day's hike. A couple ibuprofen in the evening eliminates the discomfort for about 12 hours. I was diagnosed with frozen shoulders about three months ago and my physical therapist brought them back to 80% normal. I am doing my exercises to keep them from worsening, but the rugged trail of the Appalachian Trail, demands a lot from them. After a great night's sleep at the Carter Notch Hut and an all you can eat breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon and pancakes, Seeker and I started hiking at 8am. The first climb was a steep 1200 foot climb up Wildcat Mountain A. After descending a bit, the next climb was up Wildcat Mountain C. There was another steep downhill, then the final steep climb up Wildcat Mountain D. There at the top was a large elevated deck with incredible views of Mount Washington and the Presidential Range. About a hundred feet below the observation deck, a gondola was loudly calling our names. To avoid killing ourselves hiking 2000 feet down the steep, dangerous trail, we did not hesitate to pay the $7.50 for a very enjoyable scenic ride!!","Carter Notch Hut

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601980,"It was chilly and there was thick fog at the top of Mt. Washington. To warm up, we stopped for a sandwich and some hot chocolate at the visitor's center. The immediate descent was steep and the trail was covered with large rocks everywhere! We were soon passed by Austen, a worker at the Lake of the Clouds Hut, carrying an 85 pound pack! We were amazed at her agility to move over the rocks so smoothly! The Hut is 1.2 miles from the top of Mt. Washington and has a Lodging capacity for 90 guests. Many more hikers stop for snacks and their very popular home made soup, that is always available. All the food supplies are hiked in every day by the workers from the top of Mt Washington! After about a mile and a half of hiking over these rocks, we arrived at the Lake of the Clouds Hut. Being Labor Day weekend, hikers were everywhere! At 12 noon Seeker and I departed for an incredible ridge walk to the Mizpah Hut. It was the most enjoyable hike I have had on the AT! The views were spectacular in every direction! Seeker and I were in awe of the vistas all around us and kept stopping to take it all in. I kept thinking that this hike would be an incredible ending of this three year AT adventure of mine!","Pinkham Notch

I was feeling pretty good after yesterday's hike and a good night's sleep in my tent. Seeker and I hit the trail at 8am. We had a gradual, 4 mile hike down the Crawford Path to the AMC Highland Center, a plush hotel for hikers. The large hotel was full and we were lucky to have made reservations a day in advance. The Crawford Path was a horse path to Mt. Washington from 1840 to 1870, then it became a path for only hiking. The two hours it took us to come down, we met over one hundred day hikers on their way up. It was a very enjoyable hike. It has been a relaxing day with a nice lunch and the all you can eat barbecue dinner at the hotel. Tomorrow we will be skipping some dangerous areas of the AT and plan a three day march to our finish line in Hanover, NH.","Mizpah Hut

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602324,"Our shuttle driver drove us back to the AT today. It was hot and humid, which made the climb up Mount Cube very difficult. I have never experienced such high humidity. The rocks were even sweating. I could have easily filled a cup with the sweat I wrung out of my shirt and hat! After a long climb, we were, however, rewarded at the summit with a nice breeze and incredible views. We lounged in the open breeze for over an hour, eating our lunch of deli sandwich, gatorade and a hershey bar for dessert, while visiting with some Northbound hikers also having lunch. We finally decided to start our descent. The rocks and boulders that were sweating in the shade made the climb down very slippery in certain areas. It was a very slow process finding foot placements. We finally reached the hexagon Hexacuba Shelter totally exhausted. Rain was in the forecast so no tenting tonight. We were later joined by only one other hiker named Indy, hiking Northbound. True to the forecast, it thundered and rained most of the night.Sent from my iPhone","AMC Highland Center

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602346,"Seeker and I left the Hexacuba Shelter at 6am with our headlamps on. We were hoping the cooler temperature would make the hike more bearable. After an hour descent to South Jacobs Brook, we took our first break and filled our water bottles for our four mile climb up Smarts Mountain. We notice that trail crews have been doing a lot of work as we climb. The picture shows how crews have carried and buried long logs along the trail to divert rain water away from the trail. This tremendously helps prevent trail erosion. All along the 2100 mile Appalachian Trail, hikers notice and appreciate these engineering feats that help to preserve the trail. In addition. These crews have been carrying a huge number of 8 foot long 4 inch thick planks up the mountain, to create plank walks over bogs and muddy areas near the top. Take notice Vermont! My streak of 17 days without falling ended today! I slipped on a large wet rock ledge, my feet went out from under me and I landed on my butt. Plenty of padding there so the only damage was to my ego! Our 12 mile hike today ended at the very nice Lyme Inn.

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602394,"The past week, Seeker and I have been doing a lot of reflecting about the AT journey that has taken us three years to complete. Today was our last ten mile hike into Hanover. As we hiked today, we laughed, reminisced and at the same time, tried to comprehend all that we were feeling. We were happy that the grueling ordeal of the difficult climbs and dangerous descents would be no more! On the other hand there was a sadness of leaving the incredible vistas we experienced and the quietness of hiking in the woods. We came to a nice place to sit on large rocks and enjoyed some sandwich wraps that we had bought the night before at a deli in Lyme, NH. Seeker asked me, ""What's next"". I immediately responded, ""Smoother walks with my golf clubs"". We talked about the transitions we were about to make from the routines of hiking everyday to the routines of daily life back home. As we threw our backpacks on for the last time, we slowed our pace and took some pictures of some old stone fences that had been standing there for hundreds of years. As we came close to Hanover, the trail zig zagged around these monster boulders covered with bright green moss known as the Velvet Rocks. The easier trail today took us through a lot of pine forest, with the trail covered in pine needles, which always seem to make the hike a little more enjoyable. The temperature had reached 90 degrees as we finally reached the outskirts of Hanover. We picked up our pace toward the unique college downtown area. We found a popular busy restaurant and luckily found two bar stools at the long counter. Seeker ordered a milkshake and I ordered an extra large root beer float. The air condition space seemed like heaven to our over heated and smelly bodies. We clicked glasses, congratulated one another and took our time quenching our thirst with the ice cream drinks. Tomorrow we get the Dartmouth Coach to the Boston Airport and fly home. 
I have met some wonderful people on the trail.  There were many that gave me refreshments, rides to and from the trail and others who just wanted to converse about what hiking the AT was like.  The hundreds of hikers I met along the trail were very pleasant people and anxious to share information as I was.  I felt blessed to have met Crash who was my mentor and hiking partner for over 1000 miles.  There were times I loved being on the trail, but hiking in the cold pouring down rain was not one of them!  During those times I would desperately ask myself, ‘What on earth am I doing out here’?  There were other times when the terrain made the hiking just plain tough going.  It took seven trips over a three year period for me to complete over 2000 miles of the Appalachian Trail!  Being in my 70s, it became a very difficult feat to accomplish.  Many times my mind said yes, but my body said NO!   As a teacher and coach for over forty years, I constantly preached; ‘be the best you can be’, ‘when the going gets tough, the tough get going’, ‘make the best of the situation’ and ‘when you don’t feel like showing up, put your hip boots on and wade through it’.  I had to remind myself many times to keep going because I was now the example for others, especially my grandchildren. There were hours and hours of alone time, day after day, as I walked through the quiet of the woods.  I spent a lot of time rehashing my life.  I thought about times I should have done things differently.  At the same time, I had plenty of time to remind myself of the blessings I have received as a husband, a parent and now the joys of watching 11 grandchildren grow.  Hiking the Appalachian Trail had a way of clarifying important things in my life.  As a whole, It was wonderful being away from the hectic traffic of the city and all the political drama that we are bombarded with today.  The contrast of hiking in the woods and nature was so welcoming.  I felt more alive, experiencing something new every day.  There were some lows, but there were many more emotional highs. Through it all, hiking the Appalachian Trail was an incredible experience and will be a part of me forever.","Lyme, NH

Holcomb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624923,"At age 75, I am planning a 6 to 8 day Appalachian Trail section hike in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. I will hike from the AMC Highland Center Southbound through Franconia Notch to Kinsman Notch and beyond. This is a difficult 50 to 60 mile section that I skipped when I completed 2000 miles of the trail in 2018. I will be staying in each of the 4 AMC huts through this section. I plan to do this in September 2020, soon after Labor Day when it will be much easier to make reservations at the AMC Huts. I am very excited about doing this very challenging and scenic hike.
