Heart rate was 170 for a minute and I felt horrible with sweat pouring into my eyes.  I made it to my destination. Then, then, my best friend rode back 3.5 miles to get the truck to come back for me and my bike because I was 'spent'. I am in horrible shape. 201 days to prepare physically. Mentally, I am on point.

Hopefully, this Florida heat will be preparation for the last half of the AT in July-September. Hiked through Wickham Park's trails that was full of the Devil's toilet paper aka saw palmetto, sugar sand, and pine needles. The paths taken were random but after reviewed the route resembles the outline of Italy. Bravissimo!  Saw the first pre-hike snake. The snake was black, skinny, & long. That description sums up my ability to identify snakes. It quickly slithered into the brackish water when he spotted me. Wonder if the wildlife keep track of their human sightings? My friend had a hitchhiking tick on her sock. Crazy thing is that we treated our hiking attire with Permethrin and then did not wear any of it (not even the socks). We have Injinji socks but they are not crew socks. It was so hot neither of us wanted to even wear the lighter weight liners.

Spinning is not something I would have ever seen myself doing, but since my friend has committed to the AT with me, I have committed to spinning as a training exercise. My lady part is not thrilled. On that note, yesterday, I realized that I was missing a key piece of gear for the trail. Purchased a GoGirl Pink Combo ($9.99 Amazon). I do not want to get up at night, walk 100 ft in the dark, away from my tent or hammock (still undecided) to urinate. Hopefully, this gear & a Gatorade bottle will make that activity unnecessary. Never used one, but the GoGirl Combo is arriving before 8 p.m. tomorrow. I am sure my product review will be anxiously awaited by  all :{
After spinning, I wanted to stretch my legs. My friend's knees were sore, so just me & my best friend, my friend's dog. He was excited. The pace was probably a bit slow for him. Wonder if his knees were sore. Do dogs have knees? They kind of have reverse ankles. Obviously, my day job is not a veterinarian (I even had to google how to spell veterinarian, ughhh, not a teacher, either). Half mile in 15 minutes which is maintaining the 2 mph, unfortunately, without a pack or PUDS ('pointless ups and downs').
The trail is roughly 2200 miles. By my calculations, again not a teacher, at our current physical condition, I estimate it would take a minimum of  7 months & 7 days with no Zero days (no miles hiked). We'd have to make Christmas presents on the trail and would miss the October 15th deadline to summit Khatadin without fear of inclement winter weather.

I think they are the are like the Nissan level trekking pole compared to the Lexus trekking poles out there. The Cascade poles are reasonably priced at Academy Sport for around 20 bucks.  
We hiked our normal 2 mph pace but it felt like we were going faster with the poles (apparently, just in our minds). I think we both felt the poles gave added confidence in  footing and reduced joint stress. We like them. Not sure why we had not used them until now as they have been in our AT gear for about 6 months. Ugghhh.
After our hike, we watched YouTube videos to learn all the things we did wrong. My friend had the wrong grip. I over tightened the screws. Neither one of us removed the plastic foot to expose the tip of the poles. It's a learning curve. Fun to being learning together. It really makes me believe the big adventure has already begun.

Today, we hiked 3 miles in the Enchanted Forest Sanctuary. We took Coquina trail. Oddly, we did not see any coquina shells, fairies or magical deer. The terrain was very diverse. Some of the path was boardwalk, sugar sand, dark muck, little and big rocks. A few stretches of the trail looked like hogs had been rooting. No signs of scat. The Florida I was born and raised in, is a land of flat ground and skinny trees. We actually had an elevation gain of 60 ft & saw some amazing thick oak tree trunks. Do you think trees get offended by being called ""thick""? or maybe they would prefer big boned oaks! 
We did see some brilliant clusters of purple beautyberries (https://plants.usda.gov/factsheet/pdf/fs_caam2.pdf) and red berries of the Yaupon Holly scattered about on the trail possibly from Hurricane Dorian's winds. Just learned, the beautyberry is a natural mosquito repellent and the Yaupon Holly is the only native North American plant that contains caffeine. If we experience caffeine withdraw or we are  attacked by those nasty little blood-sucking flies in the Georgia portion of the AT, we will rub the roots and stems of the beautyberry on us and brew the leaves and stems of Yaupon Holly into a tasty tea. 
Yaupon Holly sounds like a person's name, so I capitalized the shrub in accordance to proper noun etiquette. ""From the red corner. weighing just under a pound... she hails from Titusville, Florida.

Holy mackerel, I hope I am a better hiker then writer. Again, then or than? Honestly, I feel either could work as I am comparing relating to time as I am writing now and will be hiking later.
Update:

Only have a few key pieces of gear left. 
Need sleeping pads. There are so many options. Of course, my priority is light weight then comfort. Noise of the pads gets a lot of chatter when I recon my options. I do not want to be rolling up into camp with a loud Ford GT when I could have the soft purr of a Tesla Model S. Ironic, my name is Carr and I am using low NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) levels for cars as my standard for buying my sleep pad. Don’t even get me started on if I am a side sleeper or back sleeper. Apparently, I need a sleep study to do the trail! I do have the back up hammock (I know, overkill). I can see mailing the tent or the hammock home at Fontana Dam, however, it does leave room for family/friends to have trail sleep overs without having to buy gear. Golly gee, Beave, decisions.

Need quilts. Weight and temperature are the key factors I am focusing on. Actually, temperature then weight in this instance. I’m from Florida, born and raised! Lived in FLA all my life, well, minus 2 tours in the Marines and my other “A”dventures…kicking around ‘A’ustralia 08-09 and ‘91 driving the ‘A’LCAN (before it was paved). I am ready for the A.T. 2020, but I want to be warm at night. I am thinking about a custom Revelation from Enlightened Equipment. Again, overkill (that’d be a good trail name).  
I think of Grandma Gatewood’s shower curtain shelter half, sleeping on leaves, without any gear really, and I feel gluttonous and foolhardy to invest in a quilt that goes ‘down’ to 0°F or -17°C. I guess that leads to a more philosophical question of NEED vs. WANT. Like most I think, I am searching for that happy middle ground. Which is why I purchased REI Co-Op 650 Down Women’s jackets. They were being discontinued and on clearance. Initially, I thought I wanted 700-850 Down jacket. The price was too good ($49 ea.) to pass up on. The jackets are very light weight at 8.8 ounces and hip-length. Will be sure we get a good mid-layer merino or wool shirt with a hood to supplement.",,View Entry,"Oct 11, Fri",0
Rraccd ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624107,"Purist or Pragmatist? I’m not even sure that is the correct wordage. Again, the English language is my foe and the dictionary is my minefield. Hike the trail, white blaze to white blaze, mile for mile, not straying except for resupply OR hack the trail, be less picky, venture beyond the white blaze into the purple haze [1].
I know, I know…hike your own hike (HYOK). Literarily, I am at a quandary peak. Literally, I wish I was on a shakedown hike at Quandary Peak. May not answer my philosophical question but would answer a lot of other gear questions. Alas, I am aiming to be a thru hiker not a fourteener peak bagger. 
I feel like I am going to see my first blue blaze (marker for a side trail or alternate route) and have a Matrix moment. On one hand, I want to know how deep the rabbit hole goes. On the other hand, I want to stay within the safety of the white blazes. The idea of skipping a spur trail, literally the road less travelled and could have a hidden-falls rarely navigated, could be very hard. Of course, I do not want to get too side-tracked and not accomplish the mission. Katahdin or bust! Then again, my hike is not like a quick game of blackjack. It is more like a long tricky game of bridge. 
Seriously, it does become a quagmire of blazes. Giggity giggity giggity goo! There is aqua blazing, in which some parts can be navigated by water like on Fontana lake or the Shenandoah River. That sounds very cool. There is the opposite of the purist white blazer…a yellow blazer who hitches parts of the trail skipping miles by being driven. Pink blazing (no), brown blazing (of course), cyber blazing (no/maybe…no), bike blazing (like on the C & O Canal Towpath)….the list of blazing options seems endless. I will be amber blazing through deep duff for a sip of beer. D’oh!

Again, I guess I’ll be looking for that happy medium that gets me to Katahdin in a meaningful and timely manner. Maybe, 80 % white blazes and 20% other blazes. The vital many versus the trivial few.

[1] Purple Haze, great song. Personally, I feel Hendrix’s song was more about the sound then/than (who knows? Well, a teacher but never mind, never who) the lyrics. In this instance, the lyric ’scuse me while I kiss the sky” is on point. A.T hikers are sky kissers.

Rraccd ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624186,"For A.T. trail prep, I feel I need to refresh (aka relearn) some knots. Getting reacquainted with knots is probably overkill. I just keep replaying in my head, tying and untying knots for hours, while Cpl. Christie was saying (shouting), “This could save your life, Marine!”.  I am sure I had some quick-witted thoughts in my head (never aloud). What if his message was for today, not then? I don’t want to miss my Slumdog Millionaire moment. I am out of practice. I can tie a mean bunny ear shoelace and granny knot.
I have experience with friction knots (stay in control), (bow to the) bowline knot, and (hail to the) halyard knot. Stay in control, bow to the bowline, and hail to the halyard. Ditties I used, in the Marines, to remember when to use the right knot. Basically, it was bowline all day every day in the Corps and beyond hoisting the stars and stripes, I cannot recall using another knot regularly. At one point, that same hard charging corporal made the squad learn to tie a bowline knot with just one hand. 
As a Floridian, raised by a part-time commercial fisherman, I often used the Lark’s Head Knot.  It’s just a luggage tag loop. We used the Lark’s Head to secure the hooks to our fishing line. I honestly, always believed a lark was a fish. It’s a bird. Little known facts (I feel like Big Bangs Sheldon Cooper), the Horned Lark[1] is the only North American lark and it nests on the ground. Some of the horned lark’s have cool yellow racing stripe-like faces. Maybe that is where the lark’s head knot name originated. 
When fishing off/under bridges to fill buckets, we used a barrel hitch. We had to get water to keep the bait or catch alive in the bucket. Sometimes we used a clinch knot for attaching hooks, but rarely because they slipped a lot.

I am going to focus on perfecting the one handed bowline (tarp tie, rope handle, rescue harness, …), reef knot (first aid), half hitch (hanging bear bag), sheet bend (clothes line or guide line to cross a river), and timber hitch (tight line for high winds for shelter). When I do not post for a few days, you’ll know that I am all tied up in knots.

Ironic, I still need to purchase the rope/cord. I do have regular rope to practice with in the meantime. Looking at buying 50' dyneema cord from Zpacks.

Weight, I don’t knowa if I want to do that!  
As I journal, we are experiencing tropical storms in F-L-A. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings would have penned “it drummed rained” all night and gasped it was “a toad-strangler.” I am disappointed I did not think to set up my tent in advance and test her[1] out. It would have been the ultimate test, there are cyclone warnings. The last time I ‘weathered’ cyclones, I was in Australia for their 2008-2009 tropical cyclone season turned year. There were crocs in trees, crocs swimming down the middle of neighborhood streets, and cows washed into the oceans.  I personally haven’t seen the term ‘cyclone’ used in FL, but I also have never paid as close attention to the weather before my A.T. prep mode.
Apparently, the only difference between a cyclone and a hurricane is where they originate. Who knew? Obviously, not me. I thought cyclones were just ‘Australian’ hurricanes. In fact, these super storms are called a cyclone when they are from the South Pacific/Indian Ocean, called a hurricane when they are from the Northeast Pacific/ Atlantic and termed typhoon when the storms come from the Northwest Pacific.

The weather was gorgeous, and it felt as if I was walking inside Vincent Van Gogh’s Autumn Garden. Without my hiking poles, Van Gogh’s painting would have been renamed Fall Garden. Still, I don’t understand the difference between ‘autumn’ & ‘fall’ or do I?
I was shocked at how commercialized Amicalola Falls State Park felt. I had not heard anyone mention in all my reading about starting at the Southern Terminus, that there was a zipline that runs through the park or anything about the very limited parking (ironically) in the park near the visitor center. Personally, the Approach Trail was an arduous journey, both physically (this FLA girl is still out of shape for the big climbs aka anything bigger than “standard staircase riser of 7”) and mentally (it was not what I was expecting). Can’t describe exactly what I was expecting from the Approach Trail; maybe the final scene to the Sound of Music. 
I was climbing every mountain, fording every stream, watching the zipline, avoiding the Appalachian tourists and their poor parking/driving habits. I am glad our experience was on a busy weekend, because our AT departure date is April 4, 2020 which is during the Georgia Death Race. A 74 Mile ""March"" point to point ultra-marathon that starts on the 28th of March at Vogel State Park and ends at Amicalola Falls. The park and lodge will be jammed pack with finishers, their family, and crews. Need Mental prep. X 2. Check ✓, check ✓.

Rapid fire lessons learned from November (apologies in advance for incomplete sentences, poor grammar, or repetition): 
The forest service road to Springer is very narrow in parts and in the best conditions, I would not travel it again. Prior to our shakedown hike, I wanted to checkout Springer first. Yeah, that did not happen. After about 7 miles of driving on the forest service road and a truck barreling down this gravel one lane path on the side of a mountain, we turned around heading back down. Hiking really is the only way to approach this in my opinion. 
My KUIU Summit Refuge 3 tent will take practice to master.

I needed a mallet as my foot bent the stakes (not to mention, the ground will be frozen in parts when we hit the trail for reals). 
Need better gloves. Not sure what kind, but trying to look at my phone, take pictures, check Guthook, taking them on /off was a 'no-go' for me.

When you turn right on to the side trail or to make a pit stop, when you get back on the A.T. turn right (or vice versa with Left, then left). D’oh! Thank you, Guthook. 
Need to watch more Guthook videos as after using the app for a bit, I realized there were a ton more features I could be using.

Saw a former thru hiker with a jerry-rigged water bottle contraption that allowed the water bottle to hang from his pack strap vice him having to get the bottle from mesh side pack pouches. He even had it, so the bottle did not bounce. Need.

Puffy down jacket is for static camp/break times. Hiking in puffy made me 'puffy' from the warmth and sweat. Looking for a mid-layer vest as an added garmet.

Still need to work on lowering pack weight (and have not purchased quilt or vest or gloves... ughhhh). Started a LighterPack page to tweak my gear. It is a work in progress because I have some of my friend’s gear on my list so she can see it for making her LighterPack page.  
Number one lesson learned: When discussing your Lighter “Packpage”, clearly enunciate and over emphasize LIGHTERPACK page! Sounds very similar to Backpage. Not the same.

""Ladies and gentlemen: the story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent."" You don’t want cousin Itt telling Uncle Festor that you’ve made a Backpage site over Thanksgiving dinner for your upcoming Thru Hike of the Appalachian Trail. WTF!

I was anticipating virtually stopping at the Gooch Mountain Shelter. Yesterday’s rest did the old dog good and he pulled on his leash to make the most miles to date on our virtual journey, 3.4 miles. 
We finished at Gooch Gap. Guthooks says there is enough parking for a dozen cars. IRL, I would not be stealth camping near these parking areas.

the trail name ‘Rocket’ in part due to it being the opposite of his very
casual stroll whilst walking and because it sounds just like his IRL name preventing
confusion. Our break would have been at Levelland Mountain. I pulled up a
picture expecting to see a plateau or something flat on top, but it looked like
a typical mountain.
Guthooks
app, shows what looks like it would have been a bit of an uphill (817 ft) after
our break. I am still in the research phase of tracking down some local hills
In FL to simulate uphill climbs for us. Our elevation change today was 35 ft

of the 91% humidity, brief palm frond shade lines & heat Rocket and I
experienced. Just south of Cowrock Mountain at Baggs Creek Gap campsite would
be our stopping point. Technically, this would be our first night not virtually
stealth camping. 
It is Interesting looking at all the names for the gaps, trails, mountains, and
landmarks along the AT. Apparently, a large portion of the names are due to
Creek and Cherokee Indian influence. A Cherokee family named Baggs or Boggs
lived in this area. One family resided near the stream in this area until 1819
which is how it got its name. Wade Boggs is one of my all-time
favorite past Boston Red Sox players. Wonder if he is Cherokee?","Neel Gap

Received my first virtual mail drop (IRL Amazon to my front door) 'New' old New Balance shoes. My old New Balances I bought for myself this past December. I estimate the old pair had 500 miles and it was time. I am not advocating any shoe brand. I only wear New Balances because that is the brand that I was issued in 1994 at Parris Island at boot camp. For now, while I am virtually hiking/walking the AT, I am sticking with a shoe that I know. My actual footwear for the real AT, is the only item I do not have. There are so many choices: Ultra-light runners, boots for ankle support, or middle of the ground trail runner. It will drive you crazy, like flipping through TV channels not because there is nothing to watch but too many shows available to watch. 
What is most important to me in a shoe - the ability to lace them a certain way. In the Marines, we laced for quick removal of the boots. Today, I lace for comfort.  On my left shoe, I lace the laces so they do not go across the top of my foot. I had multiple stress fractures aka march fractures in Marines and the foot gets irritated with any added pressure. On my right foot, due to the recent Jones Fracture, I lace the laces constrict the 5th metatarsal.

Hopefully, my new shoes will give me the ability to catch up to Rocket who is still a mile up trail on the virtual AT. I am not worried about catching him; dogs are not allowed in the Smokies. Maybe they will be allowed in the virtual Smokies ?","Tray Mountain Road

Surprise!
Rocket used his excess miles to hike backwards to me. Now we can enter the

side b*tches) will be considered extra miles to account for getting
water/hikes into town/ or non-virtual AT excursions.  
He was
thrilled when we decided that on the virtual AT dogs can enter the Smokies and
be off leash (although, IRL, Rocket will have to stay on the leash.)  
Side
note, about walking backwards, not literally backwards, although there are
health benefits if you can safely maintain balance and your sense of direction.
The backwards I am talking about is backtracking on the trail. Occasionally,
when we start out on our walks, Rocket will have to drop a load early on (take
a pooh) in the first 1/2 mile. Decision time (Jeopardy decision music
playing). Do I hike carrying his doggy bag full of not good stuff or do I
walk aimlessly in hopes to find a trash can or dumpster? Usually, I turn around
and head back to the hacienda to a known trash bin. Physically, going backwards
is emotionally depleting. I can only imagine what it would feel like on the

The tallest damn in the Eastern United States is in this state. The western region of this state has some peaks that are more than a mile above sea level (Holy cow, Batman!). NORTH CAROLINA, baby.
I feel like we should be giving a virtual acceptance speech. Rocket would like to thank Purina dog chow for his fine meals, thanks to his owners who graciously allow him to hike with me daily (sometimes multiple times), and the wildlife that allow him to disturb them regularly from their roost. I would like to thank the real life ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy) for their trail maintainers and the constant monitoring the COVID-19 situation to ensure when it is safe that we can get out on the REAL AT.

Main Lessons Learned:
Stretching and starting slow. This made such a difference early on after I started incorporating this into my routine. At the start, I was just going without any pace or plan. Mindless walking. Now, I start slow. I take a short pause around the first mile and stretch a little. Huge game changer.
Water and food. They are important. Seems obvious but again, some days I would go without breakfast or at least a snack.
