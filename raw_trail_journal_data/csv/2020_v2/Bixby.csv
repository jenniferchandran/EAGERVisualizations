Bixby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621104,debating between Feb 20 or March 6...   no real reasons for those dates...just pulled them out of thin air.   I know I would rather start early in the cold than be late and deal with days upon days of rain.....,,View Entry,"Aug 14, Wed",0
Bixby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625635,"I've been cleared by the dr and started back to walking ...doing 6 miles a day right now with 2 climbs.  Looking to get that up to at least 12 with a heavy pack before I leave.  I am so excited. I have my room booked at the lodge.  All I need now is my flight and I will be finished with that.Most of my gear is here and tested.  Still have a few more things to get.  Will probably get them in the next 2 weeks.  That way, I have time for a shake down hike before I leave.Travel is booked for a trip home to see my kids and grandkids and parents before I leave.  So, the time should go by pretty fast.  I have been watching vloggs..loving liz handstand kidder...   she is awesome. And looks like a  blast to be around....So long for now",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Tue",0
Bixby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625739,why am I hiking the trail?  I've heard this over and over since I made this decision....  I've thought about it a lot and am well aware that I will learn other reasons as I go...reasons I don't know about  yet...    but right now..I'm hiking the trail to learn that I have no control..   to learn that tomorrow will take care of itself...  to accept what is thrown at me and run with it...   I'm hiking the trail to learn how to be in the moment...to stop worrying about the future and take care of today...,,View Entry,"Jan 13, Mon",0
Bixby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625820,"so....   currently at the dentist...Planning to be gone for so long makes you want to get all your dr, dentist, eye dr, dermatologist appointments done before you leave.I had cataract surgery in late December, so I wont have to wear glasses on the trail.  That was a biggie for me.  Worrying about loosing or breaking glasses is no longer a concern.Now, at the dentist getting a tooth pulled.  Will be back in a few weeks for a good cleaning and should be ready to go.Last thing will be dr appointment to get all my meds refilled before i leave.I am ready to hit the trail, this prep work is exhausting......",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Thu",0
Bixby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626122,"so much of the preparation for this hike are in the gear...   I just recieved one of two backpacks that I ordered, gonna try each and see which I like the most.  Comfort is huge to me.  With my neck having so many fusions and my lower hack problems, the weight in the pack HAS to carry the best possible way for me to make this hike!!On other preps..  flight is booked, hotel, shuttle, lodge..  all done!!   I got a duffle bag to put everything in for the flight.  I need to do some practice on some of the gear.  Leaving next week for a month trip to see my grands, kids and parents before I leave!!  Woohoo",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Sun",0
