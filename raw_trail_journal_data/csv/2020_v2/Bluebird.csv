Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625580,"In 1974 we moved to middle Tennessee and my Dad took us to see the Smoky Mountains.  We walked up the observation tower on Clingman's Dome.  I saw the white blazes and hikers with big packs and was intrigued.  Right then and there I decided I wanted to hike the AT some day.  Who knew it would take 45 years to get there??  It seems once the AT bug has bitten you can't let go of the thoughts of a thru hike.  I will be going northbound (NOBO) and plan to take my time and soak in this experience I have been waiting so long for.  My trail name will be Bluebird as most of my gear is blue and I tend to have a sunny disposition (think bluebird of happiness).  Two years ago a college friend introduced me to another aspiring AT thru hiker, Stickman, who lives in Pennsylvania.  We haven't met in person but have had many hours of discussion about backpacking and the AT.  We will be starting out on the approach trail on February 21.  I welcome your comments and questions about this grand adventure.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Thu",0
Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625583,"Over the years I have read many books, watched lots of hours of videos filmed by thru hikers, and surfed the internet exhaustively finding dozens of websites with great and inspiring information.  I am grateful that so many hikers have been willing to share their experiences. I have to give a special shout out to the Wander Women - Kristy, Annette and Lynn.  They are around my age and vlogged their 2019 AT thru hike.  Their positivity, love for the outdoors, pure joy, and boundless enthusiasm for the trail are contagious and inspire me greatly.  Thank you Wander Women!",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Fri",0

The approximate length of the Appalachian Trail in miles. It's not that the length of the trail is unknown, but rather that the distance changes year to year, based on trail modifications such as switchbacks and reroutes. In 2019 the trail was 2192 miles long.  This amounts to approximately 5,000,000 steps!
14
The number of states the AT crosses. From south to north: 1. Georgia 2. North Carolina 3. Tennessee 4. Virginia 5. West Virginia 6. Maryland 7. Pennsylvania 8. New Jersey 9. New York 10. Connecticut 11. Massachusetts 12. Vermont 13. New Hampshire 14. Maine.
16
The number of times an AT thru-hiker would climb up Mount Everest. Compared to trails in higher elevation mountain ranges, many falsely assume the AT to be relatively flat. In fact, over the course of the Appalachian Trail’s 2,192 miles, thru-hikers gain and lose over 464,464 ft., or more than 89 miles.
165
The number of days it takes the average person to complete a thru-hike. Thru-hike durations can range from a full-year to a blistering 46 and a half days (the current speed record), but most will complete their 2,192 mile trek in five to seven months, with the average being a week or two shy of six months.
6,643
The highest elevation in feet along the Appalachian Trail, at Clingmans Dome in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
165,000

The approximate number of white blazes marking the Appalachian Trail.   This averages out to about one white blaze every 70 feet. 
5,500
The number of calories required for a hiker to maintain his or her body weight during a typical day of backpacking. In other words, a hiker could eat 11 Big Macs throughout the day and still be at an energy deficiency. Typically, after a few weeks on trail, many thru-hikers achieve the celebrated “hiker hunger,” a near-inability to be sated by any amount of food. 
5,500
The average dollar amount spent during the course of a thru-hike. Hikers estimate spending between $2 and $3 per mile on trail, for an average range of $4,400 to $6,600. This money goes toward food, lodging, laundry, transportation, gear upgrades, etc. 
0 - 4,000
The initial dollar outlay for gear. This depends on how much gear one already owns and how appropriate it is for a thru hike.  Most who set out on the trail will fall somewhere in the middle of this range.
4-5
The number of pairs of shoes most thru-hikers go through. In general, if you can get 500 miles out of your footwear, you're doing well.  Certain terrain, like the extremely rocky trails of Pennsylvania, will chew through footwear at a much faster clip. 
262
The number of shelters on or along the trail. The AT is lined with more than 250 three-walled structures which serve as refuges for hikers, averaging out to approximately one shelter every 8 miles.",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Mon",0
Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626113,"With just under two weeks to go before I start the Approach Trail, the excitement and eagerness are building. I resigned from my position as a teacher's assistant with autistic young adults, am packing up my rental house, and preparing to put my car in storage. On Tuesday my cats are going to live with my son Paul. He plans to put them on a diet and whip them into shape! Things are falling into place. 
The gear picture shows all I will be carrying with me. Well, almost all. I realized after I took the photo that I left out my electronics items (charging cord and battery pack). My total pack weight with food and water will be between 25 and 30 pounds. This should decrease some once the weather warms and I can get rid of some of the winter items.  It may also decrease once I realize I am carrying items that I don't really need. I would love to be closer to 20 pounds total pack weight.
Hikers on the Appalachian Trail have 3 options for sleeping quarters. They can sleep in a shelter, or in a tent or in a hammock. I am a light sleeper so am not sure shelter sleeping is for me but am willing to try anything once. My tent is a 2 person and is quite roomy and comfortable. Shelters along the trail vary in size and condition. Most are 3 sided wooden structures; usually they are designed to hold 8 hikers (although fitting in more sardine style is common)!
My sleeping bag is rated to 5 degrees. During the warmer months one part of it can be completely removed and sent home which will help with weight. I'll have 2 sets of clothes - one for hiking and one for sleeping. My food goes in a bag that is made to be impervious to a variety of critters including bears, raccoons and chipmunks. I will still probably hang it in a tree or on a bear pole most nights. I may go stove less during the warmer months and eat food that doesn't need to be rehydrated or can be cold soaked. I'm carrying a personal locater beacon initially but think I will find it unnecessary and may send it home. 
I've had the chance to test all my gear and feel comfortable with it. But I'm also aware that things may change out on the trail and am willing to consider swapping out items along the way.Bluebird",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Sat",0
Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626268,"Such an abundance of feelings swirling in my heart as I prepare to travel to Amicalola Falls State Park and begin the big adventure.
Here are some...
Excited - I'm getting to do something I have thought about for 45 years!  To say I am thrilled would be an understatement.
Grateful - for my family members and dear friends who are supporting me every step of the way.
Sad - Hard to say goodbye to my two wonderful sons.  I will miss them dearly.
Exhausted - moving twice in 6 months is not for the faint of heart.  Add to that the myriad details that must be dealt with when leaving town for 6 months.  Thankfully my hiking buddy Stickman planned an extra day at Amicalola before we start hiking.  I will spend part of that time catching up on my sleep!
Apprehensive - another thru hiker shared this with me today - it's GA-ME time (get it, Georgia to Maine :)).  No amount of research can compare with the actual experience of hiking the trail.  I have a healthy respect for the AT and know it will be a huge challenge.
Reflective - thinking back over my life and the path I have taken.  And what that path will look like after the AT.  Looking forward to lots of time to ponder, consider, evaluate, examine and reflect.
Determined - I can do this!  And will put every ounce of effort into this endeavor.
Joy - there is a Wess Stafford quote that I love - ""Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life.""  Today and every day I am choosing joy.

Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626509,"We have been having some very cold weather on the trail. When it's like this, we have to put extra stuff in our sleeping bags. We put our phone and other electronics in there, our fuel for our stoves, and our water filters. We met a guy a couple days ago whose water filter fell out of his bag during the night and cracked from the cold. He was backtracking four miles to an outfitters to get another filter.  We also have to take precautions with our water supply, or it may become frozen in the night.
One thing that doesn't stay in our sleeping bags, or even in our tents, is our food. When we camp at a shelter or other established campsite there are sometimes bear boxes or cables where you can hang your food. When we stealth camp, you have to hang your food so that bears, raccoons and other critters don't get it. Stickman did a great job of hanging ours last night.
Lots of snow, wind, and cold temps today.  Stickman commented that the forest looked like a picture postcard.   Bluebird","Mile 39.1

Our biggest climb of the day was Kelly Knob.  We went from 3304 feet to 4126 feet pretty much straight up.  It really makes us appreciate switchbacks more!!
We hiked about 7 miles and came to the turn off to the shelter.  It was 2:15.  The prospect of setting up the tents and then sitting in them for 17 hours (until daylight tomorrow) did not appeal to us.  We made the decision to push on the 3.5 miles to Dick's Creek Gap where we would meet a shuttle to head back to town.  This was a decision we would come to regret.  It pushed us beyond our limits.  We made it though!  We'll stay in town tomorrow to recover and resupply and then head out again on Wednesday.

Then at lunch we were visited by Katie, a ridgerunner.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy employs these individuals, many of whom are former thru hikers.  They hike sections of the trail and stay at the shelters educating hikers and providing assistance when needed.  They work seasonally, when foot traffic is heaviest in each state.

Things we loved about Georgia:
The beauty of the north Georgia mountains
The excellent trail maintenance - I think we only climbed over 3 dead and down trees the whole length of trail in Georgia
The waitress at Daniel's, a steakhouse in Hiawassee, who gave me a hug at the end of our meal. And we thought we were leaving her a tip!
Hiking through tunnels of rhododendron bushes
Our shuttle drivers in Hiawassee, Sally and Joyce, who shuttled us 5 times. They told us stories about life in small town Georgia.  Some of those stories we may have heard more than once.
Lunch atop Cowrock Mountain
Miss Dee, the breakfast attendant at the Holiday Inn in Hiawassee. She's been on the job six and a half years, but doesn't consider it a job because she loves what she does so much. Talk about southern hospitality! She was even kind enough to braid my hair before we left to return to the woods.
Stickman has hiked sections of the AT in PA and VA but for me hiking the AT in Georgia was my initiation into the trail.  First time to see a shelter, to follow the white blazes, and to interact with other thru hikers.  It has been magical.

That is the first mile anytime you go out for a hike. Or the first 20 minutes of any other strenuous physical activity for that matter. The first mile your body is kind of in shock. On the AT it's saying, ""are we really doing this again today?"".  It's really best not to make any judgments about how the day is going to go, or how much mileage you're going to do that day, during that first mile.  It's a time to let your breathing get regulated, your joints get loosened, to slide into your walking pace, and to open your mind and heart to what the day will be.  This morning I was serenaded by a woodpecker during the first mile, which was so delightful.
It was a beautiful day for hiking!  Sunshine abounded.  Today's adventures included ascending Albert Mountain, easily the most technical mountain we have climbed.

Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627207,"It's estimated that of the thousands of hikers who attempt an AT thru-hike, about 20-25% are able to complete all 2193 miles.  This year, with the Covid -19 health crisis, the percentage will be lower.There are many reasons for not completing a thru hike.  Lack of trying is not one of them.  Here are some:
Injury. Tripping on roots, rocks, leaves, and the slipperiest thing we have found out here so far - mud - is common.  Foot, ankle, knee and leg injuries are quite possible.  We know one young female hiker was rescued off Blue Mountain in a snowstorm due to a badly injured leg.  Overuse injuries like tendinitis and shin splints are also common.
Running out of money
Homesickness - this has been a challenge for me.
People come on the trail for different reasons and if they feel like they have achieved what they wanted to, they may choose to get off trail.
Illness - a hiker was rescued from the Springer MTN shelter this year due to severe gastrointestinal illness.  Sometimes you can go into town and recover and get back on trail, but sometimes not.  We also met a young man in Hiawassee who was battling a wicked case of poison ivy he had picked up on trail.  
Having the people you started/planned the hike with have to get off trail or get way ahead of you.  Sometimes it's hard to continue without your hiking buddies.  This has also been difficult for me.
Prior injuries.  We shuttled with a guy in Hiawassee who was going home to Baltimore after two attempts in 10 days. His prior knee issues just weren't allowing him to continue.
Not being prepared or understanding what the trail entails.  Some hikers do exhaustive research.  Others do the trail more on a whim and may not have much backpacking experience.  Not having the right gear can make things pretty uncomfortable.
Emergencies at home.
There's a saying, ""never quit on a bad day"".  If you are going to quit, wait for a spectacular day and then of course you won't want to!!
Zero day in Fontana.  Contemplating the health crisis, and trying to decide whether continuing the hike is the smartest, safest thing to do.

Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627242,"Thru hikers go through transformation on many different levels.
Our bodies transform - our muscles develop, we may lose some weight, most of the men grow beards, we get tanned from being outdoors so much, we develop a distinct hiker aroma, and a sparkle lights our eyes.
Our minds transform - we develop new ways of looking at the world, new methods for dealing with challenges, delight in basic things, and grow more flexible in our reactions to everyday happenings.
Our packs transform - we figure out what gear to carry and what is unnecessary, where to stow things in and on our packs, multiple uses for the same items, and how to live very simply.
Our relationships transform - we may develop a deeper appreciation for those we have, or may come to understand that some of our relationships are no longer healthy.  We may develop bonds with other hikers that are fleeting, life long or somewhere in between.  
All this transformation is not necessarily easy, but it is worth it.First day in the Smokies!  I took the photo of Fontana Lake as I started out.  It rained most of the day which was nice on a warm day.  The bugs have come alive and the rain kept them at bay.Bluebird","Fontana Dam Shelter

There was that time I...
wore my rain poncho inside out.  This happened to be day zero, the day we signed in at Amicalola, got our thru hiker tags and a briefing.  One of the staff there gently pointed out to me that I had it inside out...
stepped to the edge of the mountain to allow others to pass.  I did this a few times and then Stickman pointed out that I was in danger of falling off the mountain.  So I starting moving into the side of the mountain instead.
stepped on a piece of dried meat Stickman had set out for his lunch, oops!
pulled all the tent stakes on both the fly and the tent in high wind conditions. Yep, as soon as I took that fly off the tent went soaring up in the air. Thankfully Stickman was able to catch it pretty quickly.
went to lift my pack and realized I was standing on the hip belt straps...this happened multiple times
found some used machine gun shells in the woods (the Army does some training in the Georgia mountains) and brought them to Stickman.  He gently but firmly told me munitions should be left where they are...
used my last bit of toilet paper the morning of the day I was heading into town - this happened twice before I learned to carry more
put my rain cover on my pack, buckled the buckles and realized I neglected to put something in the pack.  So then the cover has to come back off
wasn't able to use my stove for 3 days.  A hiker who was leaving the trail gave me his fuel.  It was fuller than mine so I took it.  Got on trail and realized it fit my stove but there was some issue with the connection so the stove would not light.  Did without hot food for three days.

Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627254,"Today was my last day on trail. In the end, the decision wasn't so hard. Our country is in a major health crisis.  On my second day in the Smokies, a local hiker called me a vector for Covid-19...as he stood a good 15 feet from me.  I thought it was a bit harsh but after some thought, I have to agree with him. I've been in and out of multiple states and towns in the last four and a half weeks.  And going forward I would probably do the same. I'm not strong enough to carry eight or nine days of food, nor hardy enough to go without a shower or doing laundry every five days or so.  My home state of Michigan has declared a shut down.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has asked that hikers get off trail.  So I am.  A secondary reason for leaving the trail is loneliness.  I spent most of my time on the trail alone.  At first it was good, it gave me lots of time to think and process and reflect. But I knew when I started talking to inanimate objects, like my backpack, it was time for a change. I'm a people person, and wasn't meant to do this trail alone.  
So this adventure ended where the dream started - I sure smiled as I passed the Clingman's Dome tower today.
What's next?  A lot I believed 5 weeks ago is no longer true.  Nothing is certain going forward which means absolutely anything is possible.
To the readers of this blog and my family and friends - thank you so very much for the interest, love, and support you gave me. It meant the world to me.

Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627385,"It's been a week since I got off trail.  My thoughts and emotions are still quite unsettled.  The only place I have really been able to be calm is hiking in the woods.  The picture is from my Friday hike.   I am healthy and staying with a dear friend who has opened her home to me while I figure out next steps.
Rather than wishing I had more time on trail, I am focusing on being thankful for the time I did have.
Some of the things the trail taught me:
Dependence - I depended on my family and friends for support while on trail - and they delivered.  And I'm fairly sure I would not have made it through the first week on trail without the encouragement and guidance of Stickman.
Self reliance - I found myself in some pretty dire circumstances with weather and terrain on trail.  I had to dig deep, conquer my fears, and keep moving.  My hiking friend Mitten called me a “tough old bird” recently.  She meant it as a compliment and I took it as such.  
Nature as medicine - I was extremely healthy on trail - no headaches, sniffles, fevers etc.  This despite not eating the best, and hiking in all kinds of challenging weather.
Hikers are good people - there was so much camaraderie and positivity on trail.  Everyone was friendly and upbeat.  
Relationships matter - getting to know and hang out with a great cast of characters - Stickman, Sea Soldier, Thumper, Super Trooper, Hottea, So-crates, Lady-killer, Face Plant aka Tumbleweed, and Houdini - was a big part of my trail experience.
Less is more…I wasn’t a very materialistic person before the trail and I am less of one now.  Wondering what in the world I put in that 10 X 12 foot storage unit and how much of it I really need!
Some people have asked me if I will return to the AT and finish my hike.  My plans are quite fluid but I don’t think I will be back to complete a thru hike.  I made some major life changes to go on the trail this year and am in the process of figuring out how to proceed from here.  I will hike the AT again - but probably as a section hiker.
Thanks again for all the support and interest in my journey.  It was a privilege to be able to share it with you.  As I enter a new phase of life, may I be open enough to see opportunities, wise enough to be grateful and courageous enough to be happy.
Big virtual hugs to all!

Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628515,"I woke to thick fog.  Within the first mile I tripped and fell and twisted my ankle.  It seemed okay to hike so off I went.  I stopped at the Cosby Knob shelter for water and a snack and met a lovely couple from Georgia who were section hiking.  The next section of the trail was steep in places and quite rocky.  In the Smokies you are supposed to stay in or near the shelters and there are very few stealth camping spots to be had.  The terrain is quite steep on both sides of the trail. I lucked out last night with sleeping on an old helicopter pad. Today I could find nowhere to make camp so did what I never thought I would do.  Yep, made camp right in the middle of the trail!  I just couldn't hike another step and the next shelter was over two miles away.  This was also a very hot and humid day.  As it went on, I was reviewing the symptoms of heat exhaustion/stroke in my mind.  Water was scarce along this stretch.
Sadly, I was not the only one who had a challenging day.  I came upon a sad scene about mid afternoon.  Two folks were riding their horses up this steep rocky trail.  There was a huge tree laying across the trail (more dead and down trees in the Smokies than I expected - probably nobody has been out working on them with the virus shut downs).  The riders weren't sure if the horse could make it over the tree.  They said the one horse took one step too close to the downward side and fell about 40 feet through the brush and trees.  I'm not sure if the rider was on her or not.  When I came upon them the horse and rider were just waiting down the hill.  They eventually decided to go through a lot more heavy brush and trees and take the horse down to a lower part of the trail rather than trying to get her back up.  Then they still had to walk the horses about 4 miles back to their horse trailer.  I knew they were coming so waited to set up my tent in the middle of the trail!  The horse that fell was limping and pretty scraped up.  I sure hope she was ok.  I came upon the buck on the lower trail.  He was standing and looking up to where the horse was.  We could hear her but not see her.  The deer was probably wondering what this strange animal was in his woods.

I think I did a mighty fine job.  I made my way through the remainder of the Smokies, stopping at Davenport Gap shelter to filter water.  I placed my thru hiker permit (the one I got back in March) in the box and walked back into the world of highways and people.  I hiked a short ways off trail to Standing Bear Hostel and picked up a food resupply box I had mailed there.  I decided to take a shower, sit on the porch, drink a coke, and wait out the hottest part of the day.  About 5 p.m. I got back on the trail.  I tend to hike with my head down, just looking two or three feet in front of me for tripping hazards.  About a mile north of Standing Bear I heard a snort and looked up to see an adult bear about 150 yards ahead of me. It immediately jumped off the trail and when I tapped my hiking poles together it ran further down the slope.  No pictures as I was pretty startled.  So even though I was on an uphill section, that put some pep in my step!  I'll try to get a picture next time.

Probably not my best decision given I've just gotten back on the trail and the weather conditions. I made my way up and over Snowbird Mountain, which is covered with many many small mountain laurel bushes and some kind of berry bush (blackberries maybe?) that are just flowering.  About a half mile down from the summit I was hiking along, just looking right in front of me, when I heard a rattle. There was a timber rattler about 5 feet in front of me.  Thank goodness it had heard or felt me coming along.  It slithered off the trail just enough to wind its body over a big log.  Its tail remained at the edge of the trail and its head and neck were on the other side of the log.  It never stopped looking at me.  I gave it a wide berth on the other side of the trail and high tailed it out of there.  I took a picture but just got part of its body on the log.  That encounter changed the way I hike.  I now scan 15 to 20 feet in front of me, look down in front of me, and repeat a few thousand times a day.  The snake definitely scared me way more than the bear.  I decided to make it a short day and stop at the next shelter.  I had camped solo the last three nights and was hoping for some company.  I was in luck as 3 other hikers stopped there.

I hiked the trail and then met my shuttle driver and new friend Doug, at a road crossing, got my backpack, and set up camp.  Not sure I will do it again, but it was the perfect solution today.
The morning's climb was again beside a river - the water serenade seems to make the climbing easier.
I had the opportunity to observe 2 new species of snakes today - a northern water snake and an eastern ringneck snake.  At this rate I will be a snake expert in no time! They were both more willing to move along than the rattlers have been.

This morning I met up with a hiker who I last saw at Whistling Gap. I had heard he thru hiked in the '70's and was doing so again this year.  We were both headed north bound so I was surprised to see him coming towards me.   He doesn't like to stop and chat but I asked him why he was headed south bound.  He insisted he wasn't.  I asked him if he had passed a certain shelter and he told me he stayed there last night.  I had to break it to him that the shelter was 3.4 miles in the opposite direction.  He still wasn't convinced so he pulled out his phone to check Guthook, the trail app we use, and sure enough he was headed in the wrong direction.  I felt bad for him.

I am usually on trail by 6:30 a.m., 7 at the latest.  Today I took my time and told myself I was letting the tent dry out.  Except it was a very foggy, misty morning and that wasn't going to happen.  I think I was delaying putting on wet clothes and boots. Once I did it, it wasn't that bad.   I finally got on trail at 8.
A few days ago on the trail I ran into 5 people - 4 day hikers and a section hiker - throughout the day.  Of the five, two of them made the comment to me, ""the journey is the destination"".  Then someone made an entry on my guest book that includes the thought ""it's not making the end but the journey to it"".   Very interesting that within a couple of days I got the same message from 3 people.  How often as we go through life do we focus on the goal or destination rather than what it takes to get us there?  Strength of character is developed through the journey from the people, situations, and challenges we experience.  A good reminder to focus on the experience of the present rather than yearning for the future.  With lower energy today I took more breaks, stopped for more pictures, and just experienced the journey. I even got to camp early enough to string up a laundry line and dry out the tent!

Bluebird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628828,"What a day of stunning views.  I climbed out of Carver Gap to Round Bald and wanted to just sit there all day and soak up the vistas.  Then I hiked on to Jane Bald and Little Hump Mountain with more beautiful scenery.  There's a video and some photos in the files.
There were so many people on the trail today.  Lots of day hikers and a few folks doing one or two night trips.  It was great to chat with people from NY, NC, TN, GA, IN, and VT.
Some of the people I ran into today talked about camping up on a bald, and how wonderful it was to see the sunrise and sunset.  As the day began to wind down, I found myself at the foot of Hump Mountain, a 5587 foot bald mountain. I decided to go about a quarter of the way up and camp. I checked the weather and there was 10% chance of rain, and winds under 5 miles an hour. Of course that was for the little town at the foot of the mountain, 3000 feet below.  I set up my tent with some difficulty, as there was a stiff breeze.  I positioned my tent with one door facing the west for the sunset and the other door facing the east for the sunrise. So that meant the longest part of my tent was facing west where the wind was coming from.  Around sunset a lot of dark clouds rolled in, and I could see rain on the mountain next to me.  But then just as I was getting ready to go to sleep, the sky lightened. So I opened up the tent, and saw this deer grazing 15 feet from the tent.  She wasn't startled, and continued grazing after I took her picture from my sleeping bag.  It was challenging to sleep with the wind buffeting the tent.  But I figured that's all part of this experience of camping on a bald, and getting to see the sunrise and sunset.  Along about 2 a.m., the winds really picked up, the temperature dropped, and some rain started.  My little tent stood its ground but it was a battle.  At times I was holding the tent out and away from me.  It was a long night.  Camping on the bald was a bad decision.  But the deer picture turned out nicely!

All manner of bugs swarm the space between the tent and rainfly.  Of course my favorite are the fireflies.  One morning I woke to a gathering of 6 daddy long leg spiders above my head.  Today as I sat in the tent, this butterfly happened by.  She didn't stay for long.
It was another quiet day on trail - I saw no one.
This section of the trail has lots of water features.  I saw some beautiful cascades today and crossed lots of small streams.  No shortage of drinking water which is nice.
I took another fall today - on a steep decline on some rotted leaves.  My dad asked me recently how I could get help if I get injured on one of these falls, especially since so few people are on trail.  If I have cell service I can call for help, if not I carry an emergency beacon.  If I activate that, help will be on the way.

The rocks were wet from rain last night.  With no one around I was able to take my time, and made it safely down.  My knees were still shaking 2 hours later.
Laurel Falls was just beautiful.  I would have been happy to camp right there!  And I saw some people at the falls.  That was exciting. One young girl asked me if I had gotten to camp out yet.   
After the adrenaline rush from the morning's effort, I didn't have a lot of energy left for the climb up Pond Mountain.  It isn't a real steep climb but seemed to go on forever.  I was so happy to get to camp.
I'm usually pretty good about picking out a tent site. I make sure it's not in a low spot in case it rains, check for dead tree limbs or trees around and over the site, try to use sites that have already been used before, and anticipate the wind and set the tent up appropriately.  Tonight I was so wrung out from the day, I literally just put the tent up without considering anything.  I did put it up where someone had put a tent before. 30 seconds after I got my last tent stake in a large limb fell from a tree about 35 feet away.  A good reminder that I need to pay attention.
For the third day in a row I ran into no other hikers on the trail.  When I left Roan Mountain on Monday morning, there was an 80% chance of rain all week. That may be one of the reasons for nobody out on the trails.

In planning for the day, I knew water was scarce in the first 7 miles.  It was going to be a hot day and I had some elevation to gain.  I loaded up with extra water, put on my pack and decided the extra water was too heavy.  I dumped it out.  Big mistake.  I rationed my water but definitely got dehydrated on the way up.  When I got to the water source I sat there filtering and drinking water for 30 minutes.  It's hard to get rehydrated once you get behind.  
I made camp on a high ridge over Lake Watauga and was surprised how many fireworks I heard during the evening.
A friend from home asked me about bugs. They really haven't been as bad as I expected. I did have my hiking clothes treated with permethrin, mostly to combat ticks. I sent them away to a company in North Carolina and they treated them. So that helps, but my forearms and head and neck are still exposed. I think I've only gotten one bug bite.  Now you do have to do a quick manuever to get your pack and yourself into the tent without bugs flying in too.  I brought a bug net for my head which I haven't needed.  I have used a few squirts of bug spray.
