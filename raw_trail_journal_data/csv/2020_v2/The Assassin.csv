The Assassin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626164,"With only 60 days until we set off on the approach trail at Amicalola state park, my excitement is continuing to amp up. I’m in countdown mode on every level. Coming down to my last 42 or so days of work, the last 8 Sundays of church, and the last 60 days in civilization until I get to start a dream I’ve been waiting on for 4 years. My waiting is coming to an end. Things are getting real. Decisions are being made, gear has been bought, hours of research have been had, and many sleepless night have gone by as I lay awake staring at my ceiling, and so wishing I were on the trail already. Now I’m sure by week 2 on the AT I’ll be begging for a soft bed and some food that isn’t freeze dried... but I guess the grass is always greener, yeah? 
But of course with all this excitement comes a dose of sadness. Sadness to leave my friends, amazing coworkers, and my mom behind for 6 months. To say goodbye to my brothers, sister in laws, and doggos. But I guess that’s what makes this challenge such a challenge. If it were easy, everyone would do it. 
I thank God every day for this miraculous adventure I have coming my way. I thank him for whispering in my ear years ago that this is what I was meant to do. That through the ups and downs and trials and misery... he called me to this incredible experience, and I’m so excited to see what he has in store for me along the way. 
Here’s to the 2 month countdown!! 
Watch out Appalachian Trail, I’m coming for ya.",,View Entry,"Feb 11, Tue",0
The Assassin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626192,"Unfortunately I haven’t been doing a stellar job at finding time to go on day hikes, but I have been doing 30 minute leg workouts at least 3 times a week and I can already tell I’m getting stronger. I’m hoping that’ll help me out at Amicalola. I’m also finally starting to calculate base weight. I have a few nitty gritty things to get but aside from that, I’m mostly covered in the gear department. I haven’t taken my pack (Gregory Diva 60) on a shake-down hike yet which I really need to hop to, because if it ends up not fitting I’ll need to find something else and fast. I’m running out of time for something as major as a backpack. I also plan on practicing my tent setup (BA copper spur hv ul2) soon as well, since I’d rather not take 10 minutes to set it up on day 1 if it’s pouring rain, so I gotta figure that out. 
Hygiene research has been very interesting. I’m leaning towards baby powder as a secret weapon for stink and sweat. I’m already committed to baby wipes as well for when I’m feeling extra gross and the next shower isn’t for another few days. I got a travel toothbrush... then learned that nobody actually uses those because they don’t have a good head. Apparently people usually just cut the long handle off of their normal toothbrushes. I’m not sure if I’m that committed to getting weight down, but I might think twice after a few days on the trail haha. Odds are I’ll probably just buy a normal toothbrush and be done with it. 
Next, I’m off to food and resupply research. Wish me luck.",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Fri",0
The Assassin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626229,"Well today was a big day! My Pablo and I went on a nice 7 mile hike around Gettysburg at a pretty nice pace. We got done in a little over 2 hours. Wasn’t too hilly but it definitely allowed my body to remember what it’s like carrying an extra 30 pounds on your back. My hips flexors were definitely a little sore by the end, but at least I know my backpack fits!! Other than a little hip-bone soreness, if rode like a dream. Well, as comfortable as a 30 pound backpack can be. Next, I need to start practicing the setup of my tent so that when it’s pouring outside, I have a rhythm that allows me to be quick and nimble and dry before anyone else. I also want to practice boiling water in my jet stove and all those goodies. A lot I’ll learn on the trail, but some of it I don’t want to risk waiting to learn. It felt good to get out and hike today. Luckily it was pretty frigid too so it was nice to know that both my Patagonia Better Sweater and my REI puffy are stupendous at keeping me toasty warm. Down to 56 days left. I’m cutting a little close when it comes to fitness, but hey. I’ll be pretty fit after 6 months on the trail, amirite?",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Sun",0
