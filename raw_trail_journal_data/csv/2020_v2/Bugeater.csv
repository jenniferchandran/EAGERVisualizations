Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545554,"So excited. My very first entry on trail journals. For years I have dreamed about thru hiking the AT. I get excited every time I read a book about it. I recently completed AWOL's book and that is where I learned about trail journals.I currently have 3 and 1/2 years of work before I retire. But in these last few years I am going to prepare to begin a thru hike within a month of my retirement in February 2020.
I look forward to making entries in the next several years and cannot wait for my first real entry on my hike.",,Initial Entry,"Aug 13, Sat",0
Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547871,"My second entry. While I would not call this a preparation hike for the AT I would call it me continuing to stay active on a trail while I wait out the remaining years of my work life.Today my wife (Linda) and our good neighbor (Polly) and her friend (Christie) all hit the trail on Kennesaw Mountain in Georgia. We took advantage of a cool morning in Atlanta (cool for us is less than 70 degrees F)for a good 7-mile hike up Kennesaw Mountain. Since it was a holiday (Labor Day) we had a lot of company on the trail. We got to the top in good shape and the view of the city was good although it was hazy.We call our little group ""Neighbors that Hike."" We get out as often as we can in the area.

Today was our 80th day of 90+ temperatures for the summer of 2016. Please bring fall on!!!!Hiked with the neighbors who like to hike. Trail names were selected today. Nightengale, Polywog, Bear Tagger, and Dragonfly (my wife Linda) were with me.Lithia Springs was nice. We hiked 10 miles in the heat.

You know.....work gets in the way, unfortunately.My wife and I and several friends hiked the 3.5 mile Gold Branch trail along the Chattahoochee River in Atlanta. Their are several nice hikes available along different locations of the ""Hootch"" here in Atlanta. The Georgia Department of Conservation has done a nice job establishing these areas in metro Atlanta. Good elevation changes and few people seem to take advantage of the opportunity.
We enjoyed it!
Now if I could only figure out how to attach pictures to these entries I would be doing good.

I learned several things that I can apply when 2020 gets here. The picture is our instructor Zach who completed a PCT thru hike in 2015 and an AT thru hike back in 2012, I think that is the correct year.",,Sandy Springs GA REI,"Dec 17, Sat",0
Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552672,"So my wife Linda and I always talked about getting away over xmas and this year we did it! We rented a cabin outside of Hot Springs, NC and invited our kids and their spouses to join us, if possible. Our youngest daughter Katie and her husband Matt (from Charlotte) joined us.
We decided to take a christmas day hike and found the Lovers Leap trail just outside Hot Springs. The trail actually shares a section with the AT. We started at the silver mine trail parking area and quickly found the AT right after the bridge over the French Broad River on the north side of Hot Springs. The trail goes about a half mile along the river before it climbs via a series of switchbacks up to about 500 feet. Everybody enjoyed the climb and the hike.

Since we enjoyed Lovers Leap so much the day before we decided to do it again except this time we parked in Hot Springs and started the hike by walking across the French Broad River bridge.
The thrill of the hike was passing two hikers who were south bound on the switchbacks. After we passed I told Linda I bet they were thru hikers headed SOBO. She did not think so.
When we completed our hike we went to the Iron Horse for a bite and a brew and the two we had passed were at the bar eating and having a beer. I spoke to them and yes they were thru hikers on a SOBO hike. They started in late July at Katahdin and expected to complete the hike in mid-January. Names were Mr. Tuxedo and Slope Turtle. They were very nice to talk to and were waiting for friends for a couple of zero days in Ashville.

Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596023,"Well, this is it! My first official hike on the AT. Actually, I did the AT approach trail from Amicolola Falls Visitors Center. I hiked from Amicolola to Springer Mountain Shelter, spent the night, then hiked back to the Visitors Center the next day. I got nearly 27,000 steps to blow by my Fitbit friends!
I camped at the Springer Mtn. shelter campsite just 0.2 miles north of the Springer Mtn summit. It took me about five hours to go those 9 miles. It was a strenuous hike with lots of climbs and climbs back down. I spent the night in the tent that my sweetie gave to me as a christmas gift for christmas 2016.
I took lots of pictures including the plaque at the Springer Mtn. summit showing the official southern terminus of the AT.
I broke in all kinds of new equipment that I will be using on my thru hike in 2020. Cook stove, tent, sleeping bag, air mattress and various other things.
There were several other people camping at the campsite including one young guy just starting his NOBO thru hike, albeit a bit on the late side.
I wanted to mention that the date of the hike was April 28th and 29th, 2017. When I put this entry in 15 months later, trail journals would not let me put in 2017 for the date. Additionally, the photo is me pointing north on the AT. I put my lip out because that is the way I wanted to go instead of returning back to the visitors center on the 29th.",,Springer Mountain Shelter,"Apr 28, Sat",18
Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596027,"Well, it's been about 15 months since my first AT hike so I thought this year I would stretch out the distance a bit and go from the Amicolola Visitors Center up the approach trail and continue on to Woody Gap, a distance of about 30 miles over three days.
Note the date I started was June 16th, the weather was significantly warmer and much more humid than the April 2017 hike. I contemplated parking my car at the top of the Amicolola Falls and not do the 600 steps from the base to the top of the falls. I ended up doing the steps and I regretted it for the rest of the day on the approach trail. Must have been the heat and humidity but it flat wore me out! The approach trail is very strenuous so 600 steps in the heat and humidity........not a good thing.
After camping at the Springer Mtn. campsite I set out north with a goal of the Justice Creek campsite, a distance of 14.4 miles. It was a long hike but I wanted to get the miles in so I had only had 6.4 miles to do the next day. Linda, my wife, was picking me up at Woody Gap so I wanted to have a short distance to go.
This outing was a good trip. I increased the distance and broke in more equipment. While I had a one-man tent (REI Quarter Dome) I decided I would like to try a two-man tent so I could keep my gear in the tent. I bought a Big Agnes two-man tent and it worked well. I now also understand why the conventional wisdom it start out a thru hike attempt more slowly (8-10 miles per day for a week or so) than try to get big miles in right away. The several climbs and descents were difficult and my legs were feeling it for several days after.
Looking forward to my next hike farther north on the AT in Georgia. Blood Mountain will be the next big climb. I am hoping to get a 4-day, 3-night hike in this fall. We will see.

The Trek highlighted the Gregory Baltoro 65 in the last two weekly updates. I went to my local REI and tried it out. They loaded it up with 35 pounds and I walked around the store for about 30 minutes. At 25% off, I could not pass it up. My reading tells me the Gregory packs are built for comfort. Slightly less than 1/2 pound heavier than the Osprey equivalent. I chose comfort for 2190 miles!!

Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609221,"Been a while since my last entry, do I sound like a broken record? Fact is, unless I start putting more entries in and learn how to use this journal I will continue to struggle with the entries (both making and adding pictures to the website). Enough of the grumblings about my proficiency in using this website.
In 5 of the last 7 weeks I have been in the Cape Town, South Africa area on a work assignment. Yea, tough place to be for work!! Table Mountain in the Cape Town area has been designated as one of the 7 natural wonders of the modern world. People can take the easy route to the top via cable cars but I would have none of that! There are several different hiking routes that people can use to hike to the top. On one perfect Saturday morning, we (myself and three other people on my work team) chose the Platteklip Gorge route. This route is approximately 2.5 miles with a 2200 foot vertical climb. The entire route is basically all up. I would rate the hike as strenuous.
The hike was beautiful and most excellent. On this day there were many people going up (and coming back down) that were on the trail so it tends to be a bit crowded. Essentially you go up the entire way on rocks and boulders. Difficult, but very rewarding. The hike is fun but the view from the top is beyond description. You get a view of the entire Cape Town bay area and you can see all the way to Cape Point (the most south-western point in Africa) along wih the picturesque shore route to get there.
At the top we rewarded ourselves with a cold beer (yes, they do have a cafe up there because thousands go to the top via the cable cars).

Other than the climb up Springer Mountain on the approach trail it was a good challenging  climb. I passed Justus Creek, where I camped on a section hike in the summer of 2018. It was supposed to be a dry day but had rain the last 3-4 miles. When I arrived at the shelter I had lunch. My appetite has finally returned after three days. My stomach churned the 3-4 days prior to starting the trail (nerves) and I did not eat much (actually weighed 184 pounds to start). I am eating healthy now, three meals a day.Heard a new saying today, ""brown blazing."" That means hiking from location to the other that have a ""privy.""A few more low mile days before I start to pick it up a bit.

My tent failed me and I had significant water coming in through the night. My equipment got pretty soaked. I kept my sleeping bag fairly dry but I could not move forward at this point with the condition of the tent.
At 6:00 am I texted my wife Linda to come get me at Neel Gap. She was about three hours away at our NC mountain cottage. I hiked back to Neel Gap (3.5 miles) to meet her. My intent was to go back to our cottage and go into Asheville NC the next day and pick up a new tent. Scot, who I was hiking with, had a nice tent he got from a local supplier in Asheville. Again, that was the intent.
My, had the world changed in the six days I was gone. I could not hardly believe what was going on with the Covid-19 virus! Linda and I talked on the ride from Neel Gap back to out cottage about all the changes but I did not want to talk about the hike until the next day.
Shortly after arriving home I received a post (via email) from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) (they oversee the entire length of the trail from Georgia to Maine) concerning the Covid-19 virus. The ATC recommended that for people who had not started their hike to wait until 2021 and for those out hiking to come off the trail. WOW.
I could not fathom getting back on the trail and leaving my wife (and family) to face this national (and world) crisis on their own. I need to be home to be responsible and to lead my family through these trying times. I am HUGELY disappointed but am making the absolute correct decision.
We as a nation need to come together and be sensible about this virus. We can overcome and be a better nation on the other end. Quit hoarding people and take a collective breath. Be sensible for the next two weeks and heed the guidance our government is providing.

Even though it was only for about 45 minutes it was still a different experience. The purpose was because my son Adam was meeting me at Winding Stair Gap, which is roughly four miles from Rock Gap Shelter. He had driven to the NOC from Gerton, NC early in the morning and picked up a shuttle to take him to Winding Stair Gap. The shuttle driver dropped him off at 8:00 am so I did not want him to wait for long. I arrived at the gap at about 8:45 so it was not a long wait for him.
This was Adam's first experience with the AT. What a day for a first experience, almost 15 miles! We had several climbs that were difficult including the climb up to Wayah Bald. But the views from the bald were spectacular and worth the climb. The attached picture shows my first view of Fontana Lake from the bald. Adam did well and was very grateful to get to the shelter.
At the shelter that night we met a lady from near the Canadian border in Minnesota. She was at the campfire we had talking to two guys from Nashville that were doing Springer Mtn. to Damascus.

When I asked her if her husband had thru hiked and if he was on an episode of Mighty Blue on the AT podcast her eyes lit up and said ""yes!""

Merchant came upon the snake and not knowing his snakes was not excited to pass the snake until I came along and told him that black snakes are ""good"" snakes.We hiked to the shelter at Fontana Dam. This shelter is called the ""Fontana Hilton,"" because it is a larger shelter that sleeps 20-24 people and also has a very large tent area. The folks at TVA have also installed a solar-powered station to charge cell phones. Also, the area has real bathrooms and also a shower facility. It was very nice.The Hilton is also a place that many thru hikers take a zero day. This is because of the nice shelter and because the Fontana Dam people run shuttles from the shelter area to the Fontana Lodge Area, where resupply is possible.We had a very nice lady from the Raleigh, NC area that provided a lot of trail magic. A large cooler full of beer, all kinds of snacks, string cheese and other necessities like toilet paper. Needless to say, there was some partying going on into the night at the camp fire (I did not partake...need my beauty sleep you know!).Also learned a little ditty from a guy that had section hiked the entire trail. Goes something like this:""Whether the weather is cold, OR whether the weather is hot, we will weather the weather, whether we like it or not!"" This kept going through mu head as I hiked in the next few days.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635562,The highlight of the day came at the beginning...hiking across Fontana Dam and entering the Great Smoky Mountain National Park! The hike was a good day and I stretched it out to nearly 15 miles.Not much more to say about the day but I do believe this is the day that I decided to cut the days short and Have Linda pick me up in Gatlingburg after seven days.,"Fontana Dam Shelter

Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635563,"16.4-mile Day. My longest day on the AT! And what a tiring day.What a bitch the day was. It was a continuous climb and descend day over and over again. I will bet my total climb distance for the day was at least 5,000 feet. And, for every climb there was a corresponding descent that are hell on the knees. The thing about being a section-hiker on the AT in Great Smoky Mountains Nat'l Park is that you have to have a permit to hike (as do the thru hikers) but section hikers have to specify in advance which shelter they are going to spend the night at. So, if you think you are tired and will stop at a shelter at a shorter distance for the day...think again. You have to truck on to your designated shelter. Btw, thru hikers have eight days to hike thru the Smokies and can stay at whatever shelter they prefer for the night.Clingmans Dome is only three miles away from the shelter. It is the highest point on the entire AT. It will be a 1,000-foot climb over those three miles. Clingmans Dome is also the third highest point in the continental US east of the Mississippi River.","Russel Field Shelter

Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635564,"Not a bad day. Lots of ups and downs again but mostly downs. Two major climbs, one up to Clingmans Dome and the other up Mount Collins. At Clingmans Dome I hit the 200-mile point on the AT...only 1993 to go!I got off the trail at Newfound Gap and caught a shuttle into Gatlinburg. The shuttle driver was very nice. Since I was the only passenger we talked quite a bit. She completed a thru hike in 2018 and this year will complete an AT section hike that she started in 2008.I bunked at a Motel 6 in Gatlinburg. When I got there I filled the tub with hot water and soaked my tired (and very dirty) body before I got dressed and found Smokey Mountain Brewery. Three IPAs and a burger and fries later I was a happy camper.That is it for the April 2021 hike. Stay tuned as I am thinking five to seven days in July to finish Great Smoky Mountains Nat'l Park and get into Hot Springs, NC.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641699,"On the trail again with Adam. we got on at Newfound Gap with our final destination being Hot Springs. We left Gerton at about 5:00 am for our two-hour drive to Newfound Gap with Linda and Lucca.Adam and I hit the trail in very foggy and damp conditions; however, we did get a few good views in. It did start to rain at about noon for about a half hour than off-and-on until we arrived at the shelter. We got to the shelter just in time as it rained hard for the next two to three hours.The trail today was typical Great Smokey Mountain National Park (GSMNP); lots of ups and downs with no switchbacks!! whoever laid out the trail here obviously did not believe in switchbacks.We have an easy day tomorrow, just 5.2 miles. This was because several GSMNP shelters are closed because of aggressive bear activity. But...Wednesday will be a big day, 16.6 miles...yikes!We had company at the shelter. Kyle from Wilmington, Delaware showed up at about 5:30 pm. He is doing a loop hike in GSMNP. Later, Dry Bones (Bryan) from Palestine, Texas and Bandana (Steve) from Washington DC stayed at the shelter.","Newfound Gap

Our original destination was to be Cosby Knob Shelter but it is closed becuase of the bears. Nothing stood out about this hike, very foggy today so no good views.Much like yesterday, after we arrived at the shelter it began to rain and rained for several hours. At least we were under cover!We had plenty of company at the shelter. Dry Bones and Bandana (in the attached picture with Adam), Beans (Chuck) from Mississippi doing a GSMNP section, a couple from Long Island, NY and a young couple also doing a GSMNP section (I do not know where they are from).After talking with Dry Bones and Bandana we all decided to leave early in the morning and do some headlamp hiking and head to Standing Bear Hostel, 18.1 miles away and just north of the north boundary of GSMNP.","Peck's Corner Shelter

Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641703,"Long, brutal day, 18.1 miles. A new one-day record mile total for me.Again, this long day was made necessary by the aggressive bear activity, which made the next available shelter (Davenport Gap Shelter) about 16.6 miles away. Dry Bones had looked up Standing Bear Hostel and the fact the hostel had: showers, beds, beer and pizza and was only 1.5 miles farther a no brainer!We all left the shelter at 4:45 and spent the better part of two hours using our headlamps to navigate the trail. It was very wet because of all the rain the previous afternoon. My and Adam's shoes and socks got soaked, which contributed to both of us developing several blisters on our feet requiring some doctoring when we got to the shelter.Adam and I grunted through the hike. The last part was a long down, which really is hard on the knees. I am glad we did not stay at Davenport Gap Shelter. It was small and had chain-link fence blocking the entrance to the shelter to keep the bears out. While it is nice a barrier for bears it just did not fit the GSMNP outdoor experience.The hostel was quite something. Almost a commune type experience. There are many structures on the hostel property and many different characters. Evidently, people who are hiking stop at the hostel and just decide to stay there. They work and contribute but it just seemed odd. The beer was really good and cold. Shared a pizza with Bandana and one of the residents cooked up chicken thighs and black beans later. Got a good belly full. The shower felt wonderful and a nice bed to sleep in was very, very nice.Tomorrow starts with a 3500-foot climb up to the summit of Snowbird Mountain. Will be quite the challenge!Almost forgot, saw a female peacock on the trail today of all things!?","TriCorner Knob Shelter

Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641704,"Wow, what a tough day. The day started out with a 2500-foot climb right out of the chute. The climb was over 2.5 miles, which did help some. We hit the summit of Snowbird Mountain and then went down about 1200 feet followed by a 900-foot climb to the summit of Hawks Roost then another drop into Brown Gap.We stopped at Brown Gap for a snack and some water. While I was out searching the very small spring-fed stream for a place to get water...I saw my first bear!!! I was walking by the stream and looked up and saw the bear looking at me about 50 feet away. We looked at each other for about five seconds and when I slowly went for my phone to take a picture the bear scampered off, so, no picture.After Brown Gap we climbed to the top of Max Patch. It was very beautiful. Max Patch had recently been closed for overnight camping and had been cleaned up. It was very pretty. We had great 360-degree views.At the shelter I had to doctor my feet again. I am very disappointed with my Merrill boots and the blisters I have developed. I think it is time to look at trail runners to replace the boots.We had a lot of company at the shelter. Bandana was there and was the fire master for the night. We had a tour group out of Hot Springs. The group consisted of about nine people out with a guide for two two nights of hiking. We also had two other guys with a dog, named Trek.","Standing Bear Hostel

Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641705,"Our destination for the day was Garenflo Gap where we were planning to call a local hostel (cannot remember the name of the hostel), which is anout a mile and a half from the Gap. Unfortunately, Adam and I stopped about 2.5 miles from the gap to get water I called the hostel to see about a ride from the gap to the hostel. The hostel owner (Jumanji) told me he was booked solid for the night...bummer dude! Very disappointing! As a result, because it would add about sim more miles to the day to go all the way into Hot Springs we decided to call Linda to pick us up in Hot Springs. When we got to Garenflo Gap, I called Jumanji and he came and picked Adam and I up and took us to Hot Springs. Bandana had hiked all the way to the hostel and was with Jumanji and also rode into Hot Springs.The day had two decent climbs, one about 800 feet up to the Walnut Mountain summit and the next about 1100 feet up to the Bluff Mountain summit. Both got the sweat pumps working in overdrive on this warm and muggy day.When we got to Hot Springs Jumanji dropped us off at the Iron Horse Station where we all went inside for a cold beer and a nice juicy burger. Linda joined us and we enjoyed the meal. When we left we took Bandana with us and dropped him off north of Asheville in Woodfin where he had friends and had a couple days of computer work to do.This is it for the July 2021 hike. I am looking to get out in September either in Georgia where I need to make up about 30 miles from Neel Gap to Dick's Creek Gap or go back to Garenflo Gap and continue north.

Linda dropped me off at Garenflo Gap where Adam and I ended our July 2021 LASH with my destination to be Deer Park Mountain Shelter (did not see any deer at the shelter), only 3.4 miles. The short day was planned so that Linda and I did not have to get up at the butt crack of dawn to drive to my drop off point. So, we arrived at Garenflo Gap at about 1:00 pm and off I went.Arrived at the shelter and shortly three ladies from Florida arrived at the shelter. They were part of a Jennifer Pharr Davis AT hiking tour. They had started just south of Max Patch and were on their last day hiking to Hot Springs. They just stopped long enough to eat a little lunch before hiking the the six miles or so to Hot Springs. Had a nice visit with them.I had the shelter all to myself this night, which is alright by me (no one has to listen to me toss and turn and snore during the night).","Garenflo Gap

Bugeater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645412,"The first day of the September LASH with more significant miles, 14.2 total.
It was a quiet day with me only seeing about eight other people on the trail. When I arrived at Spring Mountain Shelter no one else was there.
Probably the highlight of the day was hiking through Hot Springs. Hot Springs is one of the few true trail towns on the entire AT. The trail runs right down through Main Street with the AT insignia imprinted into the concrete sidewalk in many locations. I went through town very early in the morning so really did not see a lot of people in town. Leaving Hot Springs I crossed over the French Broad River bridge and started a pretty good ascent up the trail. One of the highlights for me was retaking a picture of me standing next to a tree with an AT white blaze on it. This was the tree where a picture was taken of me a good 5-7 years ago that Linda used in my retirement invitation. My how things have changed since that picture was taken!
When I arrived at the Spring Mountain Shelter I was the only one at the shelter and I thought I would probably be spending the night alone again. So, I spread out in the shelter, laid out my sleeping mat and sleeping bag then went down the hill to the water source to get my water for the night. I completed that task and climbed back to the shelter and was sitting at the picnic table relaxing. Just a few minutes later I looked down the trail to the water source and coming up the trail was a bear! It was just nosing around crunching on the nuts it found on the ground. When the beer got about 10-15 feet from me I said enough and got up and made myself look as large as I could and yelled ""hey bear, hey bear."" The bear barely looked at me and just meandered up the mountain, whew!
Later, three young ladies showed up the shelter and set up their tents behind the shelter. Later, after it got dark, three other hikers arrived at the shelter and set up their sleep system in the shelter so I did not have ot to myself after all.","Deer Park Mountain Shelter

He had completed the northern half of the trail and was headed south with about 300 miles to go to Springer Mountain in Georgia.I had one person at the shelter with me this evening.
