Red,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625676,"Having just a terrible time finding shoes / boots that feel good on my feet.     I have run thousands of mile in running shoes,  but having trouble finding a hiking shoe or hiking boot that feels good.     I am some New Balance on order.    I do have one pair of Merrell's that are OK,  but hoping to find better.    Plan to start my hike in late May,  so time is running short.   ",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Fri",0
