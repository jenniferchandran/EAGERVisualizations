Braids,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625791,"As my departure date for Springer gets closer, I am starting to understand how REAL this is getting. My flight is booked and I think I have most of the gear that I need. I have a few worries about rotator cuff pain in my shoulder, but I am hoping that PT will take care of that before I leave. I am also hoping to lose about 10 more pounds as I have no desire to add that weight to my hike. I have already added a few more things to my pack than usual and know I will struggle to keep my pack weight around 25 lbs. I retired from my high school librarian position last June so that I would be able to visit some National Parks and thru hike the AT. I completed section hiking the AT in 2014 and want the thru hiking experience where I can take my time and enjoy the trail at my usual slow pace, hopefully exploring a few peaks and stopping points that I missed the first time around, while enjoying the community of other hikers out there. I'm getting excited and, also, a little nervous. Will I get all my preparations done in time? Dehydrated food, bounce boxes, and home finances ready? Anything I have forgotten? Regardless, all will be well. Just have to convince my nerves.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Thu",0
Braids,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626548,"I'm all set to get on the plane to Atlanta tomorrow! Finally got all of my gear, food, and clothing packed - trekking poles next to my tent poles in my backpack which will be checked since trekking poles are not allowed on the plane. Bills are paid, prescriptions filled, teeth fixed (!), and everything sorted and set aside for my husband to send mail drops. People keep asking me when I think I'll be in Virginia, or New Jersey, or finishing at Katahdin and my best and most wonderful answer is that I don't know. One of the most satisfying aspects of a journey like this is that I can take it as it comes. I have no agenda except to get to Katahdin by the time it closes on Oct. 15. I have a few things that I want to check out along the way north that I didn't get to see during my section hiking and it feels so liberating to know that I can do whatever I want each day. Little miles, big miles, swim 3 times per day, sit on the peak of a mountain for several hours and contemplate the view and any other thoughts that want to wander in, or hang out in the shelter and read if it's just too nasty outside and I'm not feeling hardy that day. It's a beautiful thing to be able to experience that kind of freedom in a place of such beauty and challenge. And to test your own mettle in various circumstances and conditions, while constantly pushing yourself physically. 
My only concern is the shoulder pain that has been plaguing me for several months. More rotator cuff injury? I am determined that it will not hold me back but it has even been attacking my sleep lately. Since I don't sleep on the trail very well anyway, maybe it won't matter? I had a final physical therapy session today and was encouraged to go so ... It's on! Rain predicted the first few days in Georgia and then a few days of sun to be able to dry out. So many people hitting the Trail at the same time! About 180 hikers, those who have registered at least, leaving the four days ahead of me and 34 on the same day. Looks like its going to be crowded for a while. Lots of friends to make and a tramily to meet! Woot!",,View Entry,"Mar 02, Mon",0
Braids,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626738,"Stealth camping in the cold again after a warm landing last night in the hostel at Neel Gap. Crowded bunk room and swaying top bunk when either me or the young woman below me moved, but I was so happy to be in a warm place and get a hot shower And pizza. Everyone at a Mountain Crossings was so kind and I spent the morning taking apart my pack with Matt in a shakedown to see if I could drop some of the 38 (egad!) lbs that I started with at Amicalola. It seems I’m carrying nothing superfluous, though I learned to distribute my load better. No help with the weight until I can swap out some of this winter gear! Argh. So got a super late start, but I wasn’t planning on a big day anyway as I fell the day before and pulled a groin muscle and tweaked my back. Still, I had little energy and my feet started hurting in the heel and toes. It was another sunny day, cold but a bit warmer and less wind, and it looks like we will get one more before an entire week of rain. Oh help. The trail was just starting to dry out a bit. 
Getting discouraged by pain and cold. Sleeping is rough and requires medication. But there are also so many positives that are keeping me going. Lovely views through the leafless trees. Trail magic of Gatorade and water today before the Tenaste climb. And the people out here are great! So many young women hiking this year. Yay!! I do love the freedom this hike is giving me but I find I’m feeling a bit lonely, something I hadn’t expected. Lots of hikers out here but I hike so much slower than most of those that I started with. I’m looking forward to getting my trail legs, for getting a better hang of breaking camp again, for less pain, and for warmer temps!","Amicalola

Braids,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626839,"Today’s hike was sunny and warm. It was great to finally hike in a tshirt and be able to avoid most of the muddy spots. Spending the night at Lost on Purpose Hiker Haven. Price is $40 per night ( currently that means you get your own room!) and includes dinner, breakfast and lunch, shower w/ towel, laundry plus $10 for a shuttle from Unicoi or Dick’s Creek Gap. The owners are super kind, friendly, and eager to please. And the food is fabulous. The place itself is a work in progress but I’m pretty happy with it. Especially with 13 days of 50% chance of rain predicted. And a yummy dessert!","Tray Mt. Shelter

Braids,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627096,"Such an amazing journey, so far, though it has certainly been full of challenges. The weather continues to be on the wet side with a shower each day and/or night. I so often pack up a wet tent and set a wet tent back up that night. But at least it’s warmer! The manageable temps are a huge blessing. We had some outstanding views from Wyah Bald Tower but, alas, none from Wesser Bald or the tower in Albert Mountain, due to walking in the clouds or rain. But the sun has made some lovely appearances too and the hikers I meet have all been upbeat, kind, and resilient.The Corona virus, while in many ways seems so distant, is impacting hikers on the AT greatly. So many hostels and restaurants have closed, some shuttle services are not running, people to not want to pick up hitchhikers, and there is no toilet paper, wipes, hand sanitizer to be had while trying to resupply in towns on or near the trail. The fear has spread to the trail somewhat too, and many hikers will no longer sleep together in shelters (I am such a slow hiker that there is usually no room in the shelters by the time I arrive!) The ATC is urging hikers to leave the trail or not start and a number of people have already left. Possibly due to resupply difficulties or concerns for folks at home. I, for one, am pressing on! At least until I can go no further. My support from home is the best and I am encouraged to make the most of this opportunity or, if thwarted, to hole up somewhere short term until I can continue. I’ve been on the trail for 2 weeks now and feel stronger every day. I have connected with some great, like-minded people out here and am finding the joys in every day. So often that could be staying still for a few minutes and listening to the wind or the silence, or watching the dark eyed juncos trying to distract you from their nearby nest. More birds singing every day and I’m so happy to be in the woods. I’m excited that my best friend, Whichway started on the AT yesterday and, though she hikes very fast and far most days and I am the complete opposite, I can’t wait for her to catch up and as I hike, I calculate- then recalculate- about when and where that will happen. Fun!Finally, it is a wonderful thing to be greeted on the trail by angels dispensing Trail magic. Yesterday, Lucky Moon dispensed hot chocolate, carrots, hard boiled eggs, and chips. So perfect! Others have so generously waited in one of the gaps to give Gatorade, candy, twinkies, ring dings, beer, and other assorted yummies. Or taking your trash. On the trail, kindness is the norm and I love living in that wonderful climate. What may wait around the next corner to discover?Onward!","Wyah Bald Shelter

Braids,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627142,"I understand the perspective of thinking that I am selfish by staying on the trail. However, I have had far less interaction with the population than most others in this nation. If I get off the trail and travel home to Maine, that interaction increases a hundred fold- probably more. Non thru hikers are more of a risk to thru hikers than the other way around. You cannot keep every single US citizen undercover for an indeterminate amount of time. Everyone needs groceries and supplies and will make trips or arrangements to get what they need. Hikers are no different except we carry it all with us. And are much more solitary. I planned and saved and spent and prepared for this journey for many years. Giving up now and getting off the trail would not serve anyone and would have a huge impact on my life. There is more than one way to look at this crisis and many different perspectives and opinions. Calling me selfish is judgmental.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Braids,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627417,"A belated entry to let everyone know that I got off the AT on Friday, March 27 at Newfound Gap in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which had closed the day after I entered the Park. The left side of my back had started seizing up and it hurt to lift my left leg. I had decided already to get off the trail once I got out of the Smokies to Standing Bear Farm and maybe even 3 more days to Hot Springs where I thought there were be more resources for finding transportation home. But my back had other ideas and I knew it would be stupid to forge ahead and hike for 3 more days out of the Smokies with that liability. I assume it was a combination of many things that caused this affliction. There were a number of times that I tweaked my back in contortions made to keep myself from falling in the perpetual mud. There was the additional weight of more food carried for longer distances with limited resources for resupply. And then there was my mental decision to get off trail that may have clued in my body to not have to hang in there any further. 
At any other time, I would have handled this temporary pain by getting a ride into Gatlinburg, finding a place to stay and taken a zero day or two to rest and heal before getting right back on the trail. But the world is in crisis. And even finding a way out of Newfound Gap to any kind of civilization was a problem. Gatlinburg was 15 miles away and Cherokee was on lockdown. I called Park Headquarters to ask if a ranger could come get me but was told that no vehicles were allowed to enter the Park, as it was closed. A nice ranger, Jim, tried hard to help me find a solution, and I was also in touch with Miss Janet who was helping hikers get off the trail with networked resources, but the only answer I got for a while was that I would have to walk. Considering my back, that would have probably taken 2-3 days if possible at all, and without any water sources to sustain me. Finally, Jim came up with my only option for getting out of the gap. Only an ambulance would be allowed in to bring someone out. So that's what happened. I was taken to the medical center in Sevierville where a kind young man helped me to find a hotel that was open. I took a taxi there and a good friend came from Atlanta to get me the following morning. It was culture shock and I had a lot to learn about the safest ways to handle oneself with the pandemic. The next day I was on a flight to Boston, and then home to Maine, thanks to my best friend who came to pick me up - also a thru hiker who had started later than I did and gotten off the trail two days earlier. 
Information on the trail was spotty and often circulated in conjunction with rumor and hearsay. Because hostels and businesses were closing, there was little opportunity for recharging devices or battery chargers so not much time and battery could be spent on researching facts regarding Covid 19 and also it's impact on our thru hiking. We thought that we were fairly isolated and coming into contact, for the most part, with only other hikers. I only just learned a few days ago that someone could be a carrier without being symptomatic. Either I missed that piece of information in my limited reading of posts and emails from the ATC, Dept of Natural Resources, the CDC, or other entities suggesting ending my thru hike or it was not stressed enough. Because now I get it. If I have contact with even one postal worker while picking up a mail drop of food and supplies from a town post office, then that has the potential of spreading the virus further if either one of us is a carrier. 
So this is the definitely the right thing to do. I miss the trail almost desperately. It's a simpler, kinder world out there and the woods and mountains were just beginning to awaken with the bounty of spring. I was so excited to witness that transformation and I'm glad that I was able to enjoy just a small snapshot of that magic, even if I had to miss most of it. In 24 short days, I experienced so much beauty, joy, kindness, generosity, challenge, magic, friendship, and more. I don't regret it for a second, despite all the rain and the mud. With my slow pace and inability to do big miles, I don't believe that there will be a way to complete a thru hike this year, despite flip flopping or other hiking location strategies. And I don't know if my arthritic body, my finances, or my schedule will make it possible to try again next year. So, I will have to take from this experience what I can and understand that some dreams may have to remain in our imaginations. And our imaginations are an amazing receptacle for such things.
Onward.","Stealth site
