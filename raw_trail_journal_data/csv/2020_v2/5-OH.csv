5-OH,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626409,"One of the biggest things that has been holding me back from doings thru hike was my job and finances. Once I got the blessing from my awesome wife, I had to tell work my plans. I have always been a hard worker and done well for myself and family. It was a very hard decision to take this step to quit my job and go on this adventure.

I didn't sleep much last night before as all kinds of scenarios played out through my head. Finally, I had enough and drove to work an hour and a half early. I walked in knowing this dream was going to come true. They could be understanding or not supportive but it wasn’t going to change my mind. I pulled her into the conference room and told her about my plans for the grand adventure of my thru hike attempt. It was very well received and comforting to know that HR understood my decision to take this step. I was even given a big hug and it went better than I thought it could ever had believed. I'm very lucky to have had all my coworkers and their support. I will definitely be thinking about them sitting in their cubicles when I'm enjoying a nice lunch break on a beautiful vista. I will also miss the customers I had the opportunity to serve and laugh with. 
As one of my coworkers asked; what are your plans when you come back? I don't know. I guess we will see where the wind blows me. (which is scary because I'm a planner and not really that spontaneous)
Now the planning really starts. Let the journey begin!",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Thu",0
5-OH,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626415,"So, my
wife left me for the WEEK. She is on a cruise ship headed for the Bahamas. This
is a trip she has planned for several months with her parents and aunt. I’m
just hoping my start date doesn’t change because she got quarantined for the
Corona Virus.
I was
going to leave on March 7th but we came up with another plan. I will be leaving
on February 28th at Springer Mountain. On Friday February 27th
I will be driving to South Carolina to my in-laws newly built house. We have been
watching my mother in-laws’ cat since December when they became homeless from
selling their house earlier than expected. Well I guess not homeless, they
moved in with other family and just couldn’t have the pets. BTW Pat if your
reading this you cat still loves me more!
As the
wife is gone the honey do list had been acquired. No big deal, its just really
getting things ready for her to be my support while I’m on the trail. I’m the
luckiest man in the work to have a wife who is so supportive of this adventure.
Her trail name is Honey Bear! Only because she is my HONEY and turned down the
name Lazy Google.
I have
just been preparing my gear. I’m lucky and don’t have to buy very much as I already
have gear for winter and summer for backpacking that’s been collected over the
years. Well that’s at least until I climbed into my one-person tent. I felt
confined and couldn’t see myself in the single person tent for 5 to 6 months. It
felt like a jail cell I couldn’t even sit up all the way to take my shoes off.
Now I’m a proud owner of a 2-person tent. Everything else I already had. I even
have enough backpacking food stored to get me through my first resupply and for
a supply box to be sent to Fontana Dam before I enter the Great Smokey
Mountains. My pack is weighing in at 22.5 lbs base weight. It is definitely
heavier than I normally hike with in the summer because of winter clothes.  (Base weight- everything except consumables:
food, fuel, water ect) 
I will answer all
some of your questions I have been asked in the next entry.",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Fri",0
5-OH,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626419,"The Appalachian Trail is a trail that extending from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine.
How long is the Appalachian Trail?
2193.0.
How many states does the Appalachian pass through?
It goes though 14 states, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. How long does it take to hike the Appalachian Trail?

The average is about six months. Some take 4 to five months. Are you bringing your dogs?

No, I’m afraid aspen will eat a hippie.
Are you bringing a gun?

No it weighs too much and never had a reason to bring it.
Are you scared of the people you will meet?

No, I have met some interesting people on the trail during my hikes but I never felt uncomfortable. Yes I have witnessed some very stupid behavior. I just choose to hike faster then.
What are you most nervous about?

Leaving my family for 5 to 6 months. Getting hurt. Not finishing. This is where anxiety sets in but you can’t control any of these things you just have to go day by day. AS people say don’t quit on a bad day.
What about bears? Are you carrying bear spray?

What about people? I think people are more dangerous. If you hang your food and are smart you won’t have problems, they are just black bears not grizzly bears. I will not be carrying bear spray. If you have ever been pepper sprayed you probably don’t want to relive that experience in the back country.I’m more scared about snakes.Where will you use the bathroom?Shelters typically have a privy. If not you dig a cat hole. Basically you will shit in the woods. 

What will you do about food?

No, I’m not hiking with 6 months of food. I will stop every 3-5 days in a ton to resupply.
What about showering?

When I go into town I will stay in a hostel or motel.
Where will you stay?

The AT has shelters every about 8 plus miles or I will stay in my new luxurious 2 person tent. I will switch out to my hammock in the summer.
What will you eat?

Anything I want. I will focus on keeping my pack light and eating for performance. Probably even shed a few pounds from walking all day. 
 

What will you do about water?

I will use a water filter called a Sawyer squeeze to purify water. I will also use aqua mira tablets to treat water.


If you have any questions please let me know as much as I am doing this for myself, I want to keep you all updated and answer any questions for you. 
Hopefully my journey will inspire you to get out and hike.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Mon",0
5-OH,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626434,"Pack is packed.
Trying not to overthink everything today. I know what I have works for me but
you are always thinking. I know the 22.5 lbs will lighten up once I really
figure things out in the next month. I’m sure I will send some stuff home
especially when it warms up. I definitely packed my fears compared to the
summer. Definitely afraid of hypothermia as it is very rainy and chilly in Georgia
right now. Temps during day can be 50's and int he 20's and occasionally colder
at night. Definitely a chance I will get snowed on at some point especially in
the Smokies. I'm not gonna bore you with what all I’m taking right now. Maybe
later…
Oh, the
honey do list is done while my wife went fishing in the Bahamas. 
It’s
getting crazy close and hard to not over think this…. 4 Days",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Tue",0
5-OH,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626446,"Getting things finished around the house today. Today and tomorrow I'm visiting with friends and family before I set out. Crazy to think I will be gone for months.  Got my AWOL Guide today. I was going to use previous years but what the heck 16 bucks for all the updated info. (AWOL Guide- list mile markers and points of interest such as: shelters, views, water sources, information for towns, shuttles and amenities.  Is it Friday yet so I can see the wife? (No Corona Virus reported yet on her cruise ship)",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Wed",0
5-OH,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626492,"Today was a great day my mind was more at ease. I went and had dinner with my Mom and Dad. It was great to see them before I left on this adventure. It also got me away from over thinking everything. After lunch, I had an epiphany, why were the in-laws driving all the way up from South Carolina to Columbus, Ohio to pick up their dog who was also being babysat? They were going to make a separate trip in the next week or so to pick him up. I then went and picked up Poundcake the Golden Retriever and he was going to take the journey with me and the cat down to South Carolina.
 
My goal was to leave late at night so I could drive-through the night when traffic wasn't so hateful. I ended up laying down for a nap but Poundcake though otherwise. He laid next to the bed and sounded like he had sleep apnea and kept snoring or snorting and would wake me up only after I had slept for about an hour. I decided to just get on the road a couple hours early. The Jeep got loaded up with everything I needed and the cat and Poundcake. Two minutes into our journey the cat is going ballistic in its crate. For 45 minutes it just kept meowing not stop. This resulted in me not being able to shift the Jeep and pushed the clutch because it was on my left leg. I moved it to the passenger seat for about 2 minutes and it decided to crawl up both my arms and back over to my left leg and I about wrecked. I hadn't even left my home State of Ohio yet and the cat was going to cause me to wreck. I finally got that situation taken care of cat in crate with a towel over it. the cat still would not be quiet in would just continue to meow and meow for basically the 10 hour trip.
 
Another trip bonus was a rock flew up and cracked my wind shield. As I looked out the windshield, this reminded me of something that I needed to keep in mind on the trail. Every day is going to be different but there could always be that rock that flies off a truck and makes it a little bit unbearable. But what can you do. I couldn’t stop the rock it was beyond my control. You can get mad at that rock or the rain or that mud or the next steep climb up a mountain. But in all reality, there is nothing you can do about it just grin and bear it. Keep on going there's no sense in getting mad about or frustrated because you won’t be able to change that rock, the cold, the rain, the bugs ect.
