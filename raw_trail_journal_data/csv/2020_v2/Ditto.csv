Ditto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626310,"Today is my birthday!  64!  How did this happen!  I'd thought this would be a cool start date (02/20/2020).  Or Saturday the 22nd (02/22/20).  But I've read enough accounts of the low temps at night and though I think the cooler day temperatures would be nice, I'd rather wait for a bit of warmer nights.  I also would have liked to start ahead of the bubble and at Amicalola Falls' Springer Mountain...the plaque...the classes...the official hiker number and bag tag...the weighing of the bag.  The excitement and camaraderie!  However, for me, starting at Shenandoah Nat'l Park will provide (from all accounts) relatively gentler hiking for getting my hiker legs, access to food along the way, campgrounds and lodges if I want a change of venue or a shower!  I'd like to end up at Harper's Ferry for the flip flop festival the last weekend of April but will hopefully arrive sooner.  Additionally, there is support of flip flops as a way of spreading out the extreme impact on the trail.  In 2018 I backpacked with a friend starting at Rockfish Gap and heading south for a few days and while that ground covered will not count for this attempt, I prefer not to start further south where I've already hiked.",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Thu",0
Ditto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626345,Shopping for a few last additions for my journey.  Trying to figure out portable power devices to backup my iPhone.  Don't know enough to even know what to look for.  I'm so technically challenged:(   Do I even need one?  Still time to decide.,,View Entry,"Feb 21, Fri",0
Ditto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626357,"I haven't shared my plans with too many people.  I've shared the couple times I've gotten on trail and the thrills and challenges and tough times but a few weeks vs 6-7 months it will take me...if God willing this old body holds out...well that's a whole different thing.  Most of my good friends are not into hiking, much less backpacking and don't get why I'd want to voluntarily load a 30-35 lb pack on my back (still working on getting the weight down), trudge up and down mountains all day, dodging rocks and roots, in whatever weather might be happening at the time and shelter in the tiniest of tents on the ground (save for a blow up pad and a sleeping bag).  Add in the whole peeing in the woods, no shower at the end of the sweaty day and lack of all the comforts of home and I can understand...but it's just something I've gotta do.  The important thing is that my husband is supportive.  Or could it be that after 43 years of marriage he's learned not to make too much of something that may never happen.  Here's to making things happen!",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Sat",0
Ditto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626391,"My trail name ""Ditto"" is self-imposed.  I know there's a tradition to obtaining a trail name from fellow hikers while on trail.  I'm open to this but given my start date and location I'm not sure I will have those connections early on.  In the meantime I would want to sign shelter logs, etc and so it is.  Why ""Ditto""?  In reading the entries from so many of my now fellow AT trail journalists, as well as the books from former thru-hikers, I found myself saying ""Yes!  I get that!  That's exactly how I feel!""...in other words, ""Ditto"".",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Mon",0
Ditto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626499,"The waiting is the hardest part...  I'm not interested in my current day to day activities; I'd rather be hiking the appalachian trail!  Been fine tuning my plans, my packing, my food.  Looking at AT planners for leads on resupplying and where to take time off trail if needed, etc.  Been reading these journals of all those/you who are out there already and it just makes me so proud and pleased for them/you all and excited for my own journey.  I'm reconsidering my start as I can't fathom waiting another month.  Even though the bubble will be impossible to avoid, I would like to have the Springer Mountain start but still turn it into a flip flop.  I could hike a week or so through Georgia then skip up trail to Rockfish gap through Shenandoah Nat'l Park and the roller coaster and into Harper's Ferry for the festival the last weekend of April.  If by some miracle I arrive earlier than the festival, I would keep going as far as I could and get a shuttle back to Harper's Ferry.  Of course there's a possibility that by then I might not want to take time out for it.  Who knows?  I'll be playing it by ear.  Rolling with the punches.  One step at a time.",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Fri",0
Ditto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626844,"I've pretty much done everything I'm going to do before taking off.  My final orders came in from Amazon and REI so that's good.  I'd been given an over the top battery back up for Christmas by my over the top great daughter in law but though it had all the bells and whistles and power for most anyone's needs, it was a bit on the heavy side for backpacking so... after weighing if I even needed one and getting some advice...I found I could exchange for the less powerful, less weighty anker plus get another small item(powdered coconut milk) as a bonus.  Thanks Deanna!!  So now I'm saying next week.  Yikes!",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Wed",0
Ditto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627037,"My plans are evolving as I type.  I love that so many hikers are out there now or are leaving to start this week or next and I want that to still be true for me.  I keep re-packing my pack.  Fine tuning.  Eliminating then adding back in what I think I can't live without.  And I must say that this last time my bag felt amazing!  My initial plan was to begin the first of April at Rockfish Gap and hike so as to eventually end up at Harper's Ferry for the flip flop festival...which is now cancelled :(   Enter the coronavirus which I haven't been too concerned about till I was reminded via email two days ago, that I am in that most vulnerable group of people with ""underlying health issues"".  I don't think about this because as a rule I don't get sick and I don't let anything stop me from doing what I have decided to do.  However I also don't want to be foolhardy or dismiss the concerns of those I love.  So I'm taking an extra few weeks at the least to see how things go.  I believe I read somewhere that as long as the trail is completed in a 12 month period it would be a thru hike?  If that's true, even if my start was too late to finish this year, I could come back early next year to complete?  If anyone knows the answer to this, I'd welcome the input.  I don't want to just live vicariously through everyone else's adventures...as much as I've enjoyed doing just that. I am trusting...",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Mon",0
Ditto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627149,"Decision made.  I will postpone my hike till there is real treatment options and the health care community and other resources and services in our country has been made whole again.  I am very fortunate in that I am retired and free of responsibilities that would make this point in history the only time to do this.  I have also not made so many sacrifices to be able to get to the trail as my hike has not begun.  My heart goes out to those of you who have scraped and saved and sublet your housing and made a myriad of arrangements to get to the trail.  I trust you are carefully weighing your decisions at this point.  For me, it really is not that difficult.  Though I would describe myself as a strong healthy woman, the fact is I do have a medical condition that puts me at risk and if I did get sick on the trail, it would escalate quickly and seriously.  With resources so depleted and severely limited in  America's smaller communities, such as flank the trail, I do not want to nor could I count on those resources being there for me should I need them.  This is purely from my standpoint regarding my own health.  But additionally I personally would be devastated if I were to arrive to begin my hike feeling great and healthy, yet already have the virus, then a week later start to show the symptoms of the disease after miles and miles of hiking...staying at shelters...talking to people...unknowingly spreading the disease...  This is where I'm coming from.  My own personal take on the situation.  But I will get out there hopefully in the not too distant future.  Be safe!",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Thu",0
