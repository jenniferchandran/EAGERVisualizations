Mike Beidler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626564,"Probably the biggest item on my bucket list (Thru hiking the Appalachian Trail) is becoming a reality!  I've wanted to thru hike the Trail for over 20 years! So I sold my house, retired, and now focusing on getting my body ready for the long journey.  I will be starting the last week in April from Harpers Ferry, WV and NOBO(north bound) to Katahdin.  Then bus/train/car back to Harpers Ferry and SOBO(south bound) to Springer Mountain. This method is called a Flip Flop. It avoids the bubble of thru hikers and is more environmentally friendly for the trail. If all goes well I should finish mid October, although there is no rush to finish by a certain date.   One of the great things about being retired!",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Tue",0

Mike Beidler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628291,Thunderstorm last night. Heavy rain and loud thunder. Did not see much lightning which was fine by me! Hammock stayed dry although there was little drying of the clothes I rinsed out in the stream. Fairly easy walk to Pine Grove General Store (3.7 miles) although I did get a stone in my shoe which cut my foot and bothered me all day. Had a delicious bacon/egg breakfast wrap and some ice cream. Skipped the half gallon ice cream challenge. Second half the day was a bit more difficult with a long downhill rocky trail. Cut on my foot was quite painful with every step. Nice camp site but it's close enough to a road so weekend campers can hike in. May have to use ear plugs tonight. Another great day in the woods!,"Tom's Run

Great little store with super people!  Then on to Boiling Springs where sections were put down the trekking poles because you need both hands and feet to climb the boulders. A sample of things to come. Met ""No Worries"" and her dog Aspen at a shelter while I was eating lunch. After talking for quite some time, she gave me my trail name ""Grimm"" as in Brothers Grimm as I like telling stories. She pegged me pretty well!  Camp was awful. No trees to hang my hammock so I used my tarp as a shelter and slept on the ground. Temps dropped to 44° making for a chilly night. Almost forgot, camp was 100 ft from RR tracks with freight trains coming thru every 1 to 3 hrs and blasting their horn. Not much sleep! But a great day overall!

Hands and feet climbing up boulders. Highlight of the day! It was so much fun!!!  The remaining 15.2 were not so fun. Mostly rocky trail that wears on you. Don't dare look up or you will roll over an ankle or stub your toe. Very exhausting! Several water cashes left by Trail Angel ""Mun"", who leaves 170 gal of water per week along dry spots on the trail. Incredible commitment by this Angel! There is a stretch of 10 miles with no water source except for the emergency spring which has heavy metals in it. Much of this area is contaminated due to zinc smelting years ago.

Ate second breakfast at a bakery - sausage patty and 2 eggs between 2 slices of cinnamon raisin bread french toast! Fabulous! After exploring town, had banana split!

I've had blisters and skin abrasions like I've never experienced. But then again, I've never taken a backpacking trip this long. Eating a lot while in towns! Think I'm losing weight too quickly.

I need to do some research on geology of the Appalachians. Although there are a fair amount of rocks still, and anticipate rocks in every state, they are different now. First noticed as I started descending into Delaware Water Gap on Monday, the rocks are more worn and laying flat vs sticking out vertically. Not sure if it's due to plate movement or could be where the glaciers stopped. Trail was anywhere from flat and smooth to very rocky. Views were spectacular! NJ runs you on top of ridge lines so views can be seen both east and west in the same location. Camping alone tonight, perhaps the site name spooks others (rattlesnake spring).Fantastic day on the trail!!!","Delaware Water Gap, PA

Lives in Brighton but she went to college at Western. Not many on the trail today. Started my day with the realization my right shoe must have blown out yesterday. Have a 3"" cut in the outside edge. Later I saw the toe area is also falling apart quickly. Getting to camp this afternoon, discovered the left shoe has blown out on both inner and outer sides. 1-2"" cuts. Pennsylvania took its toll for sure. Ordered shoes but it could be a week before I will get them. Looking at other options! Duct tape will be the 2nd purchase in the morning in Branchville, NJ. The first is breakfast at a deli next to the trail as it enters town. Having a real breakfast will be a treat! Plan to pack out a sandwich for lunch. There is an outfitter in town but it's hunting and fishing gear centered. Saturday I'll see about getting a ride to another outfitter who should have something, even if it's not ideal. Will be better than camp sandals. Very humid today. Only took a couple pics as it was hazy. Lunch was next to a glacial lake. Ate a double lunch as I'll have a deli sandwich tomorrow. Yummy! Laying here in the hammock I've realized it will be an earplugs night. Mosquitos are thick and hungry! Sure glad I have full netting!Another great day!!","Rattlesnake Spring

Last night we had a bear try to get into the shelter. Not a very bright bear, he kept trying to get thru the floor instead of using the 4 steps leading in. I was sleeping in my hammock 30' from the shelter, completely unaware except for the flashlights. lol 
First stop was Sunrise Appalachian Deli were I stuffed myself with a very good breakfast sandwich, muffin, orange juice, and 2 unsweet tea's. Packed out a Philly Cheese steak for lunch and dinner.
Saw 3 bears today. 1st was anticlimactic. I saw it, backed up and it went behind a bush. Bears 2&3 were more exciting! About 75' in front of me,  one was on the trail and the second just 10' from the other bear. I tapped my trekking poles together and they ran. Problem is, one went to east side of trail and 2nd on the west side. Now I have 2 bears traveling together on opposite sides of me. West side bear stopped close enough to take a couple pics.  Then he decided he'd had enough. Started jumping up and down on his front feet, pounding them to the ground, then let out a couple I'm warning you grunts! I decided it was time to move along. Also keeping in mind I had another bear behind me somewhere.  All was good and I never felt in danger. 
Made arrangements to stay at Mosey's Place (hostel) tomorrow. She will take me to an outfitter who has a good hiking shoe selection. Only 5.5 miles tomorrow but new shoes will be great. And a shower also. I'm starting to get use to my stink.
Met Megan who stopped by the shelter tonight, a ridge runner, whose job is to hike up and down the trail educating people on leave no trace, picking up trash, reporting any trail issues, checking privy conditions, etc...  Wonderful young lady with a marvelous attitude. The type of person who can make a great day even better.

Had a really good time here at the hostel. I was the only one here so instead of ordering delivery, I took the hostel owner out for dinner. Restaurants are allowed to have outdoor seating in Port Jervis area. Owner is a 2015 thru hiker who has opened her home to other thru hikers. Very nice lady! I will be giving this place great reviews!!
She has a scale in the hiker bathroom! Drum roll please - I've lost 19# since I started!! It really shows! I suspect a lot more in fat! My legs are getting bigger! They are starting to look like my younger years when I was lifting lots of weight?

Wonderful older couple originally from Chicago, now living in Philly, who have a summer place near here. They were day hiking. I'm now deli blazing. Nearly every day while hiking thru NJ and NY, you can go into towns and eat at a deli and then carry out your next meal. Today was Annabelle's Pizza. Two slices of amazing pizza! Then to the general store for ice cream. Few blocks down for a beer, then out of town. Mile later was trail magic. Had a Pepsi which I've not had for nearly 10 years and a Pabst Blue Ribbon.

There is a momma bear with 4 cubs who has been very aggressive towards hikers, particularly at Fingerboard shelter. It's gotten so bad they had to close the shelter and strongly ask hikers to not camp between where I was last night (Wildcat) and William Brien Memorial shelter. A 19.8 mile corridor. My original distance today was to be 14.5 miles which is manageable on a typical day. Last night we had severe thunderstorms which kept all of us at wildcat up for hours. It made for a late start waiting on the rain to stop. Rocks were slippery until the sun came out around 10. Not getting started till 8:30 was going to make it challenging to put in 19.8 before dark. Became clear I was not going to make it before dark so got off trail at NY-17 and walked 2 miles to motel. Pizza, salad, & cheesecake for dinner.

I ran into them at Graymoor where they told me to find somewhere else to camp. I took the high road and wandered off.

Taking a couple days off the trail to let blisters, abrasions, and swelled feet heal. It's gonna be boring, but needed. I'm thinking it's the swelling that has caused blistering and abrasions. I've been sitting here for several hours and realized I can't bend my toes!

1) Skip the rest of NH and ME, and go to Harper's Ferry and do the southern half. This means I'll not complete the entire trail. This option I'll regret the rest of my life.
2) Jump ahead to Maine and come back to NH and finish the remaining 91 miles, then on to Harper's Ferry and finish the southern half. Southern Maine is nearly as hard as NH from what I'm told.

Where everyday is surreal, and to continue my spiritual journey. I'm different now, hopefully a better person. As a wise hot dog stand owner (Mitch) said to me when I told him this has been a spiritual journey, ""Have you figured out how to stay on this journey after you are off the trail"" I don't have the answer yet but I think about his words nearly every day. Grimm","Michigan

Mike Beidler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630102,"On the trail again! I was a bit nervous this morning as I stepped back on the trail. Would the knee pain come back, would 2 weeks off trail take its toll, would I have the same surreal experience, ...... So many thoughts bouncing around inside my head!  
The first climb was a tough one. I was sweating profusely, knees still felt okay but I was exhausted. This climb should have been a walk in the park compared to what I had experienced just 2 weeks ago! When does the train head back to Michigan? No, no, no, don't even think about that! Finally made it to the top and all was good from there. Some tough sections of rock, much like Pennsylvania where I felt like I was learning to walk for the first time.  
Arrived at my planned stopping point at noon. Much to early to stop so I ate lunch and set out to do another 3+ miles. Arrived at 2:45 which is still a bit early but figured 12.5 miles was a good first day out.
Knees are aching and were a bit painful when I had to go down steep steps to get water. Nothing like the White's though!  All in all, a great day on the trail! ","Harper's Ferry, WV

Chicago is known for. pizza, Cincinnati for Chili, New England for clam chowder, ...   Virginia for the roller coaster. 13.5 miles of ups and downs. What they don't mention is the rocks! Day started off easy and I'm thinking Virginia is for lovers and I'm loving Virginia. Then came the roller coaster! Not loving it so much at the end of the day. Knees were really bothering me so I stopped early. On the bright side I'm where I had originally scheduled myself to stop today. Tomorrow I have 6 more miles of the coaster ride before it hopefully settles into a more knee friendly trail.
Had a big surprise this morning as I woke at 5AM! The sun wasn't up! Then it dawned on me that I was south where the amount of daylight is greatly reduced. I was use to 5AM sunrise and 9:30PM sunset. Today was 6:15AM and 8PM. And a lot warmer and humid now. 
I think today would have been easier if it hadn't been a weekend. Day hikers were everywhere! 100's of them! They just don't pay attention to what's going on and hog the trail. It was either jump to the side of the trail or collide. Very frustrating!  It's not just here, it's every weekend. Covid is bringing people out that have never enjoyed hiking. I'm not complaining about that one bit. I'm glad people are realizing what nature has to offer.

Mike Beidler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630134,"i knew I could do it!  My previous couple of days have been disappointing mileage wise. The Roller Coaster was difficult but yesterday's 10.5 was hard to swallow. Today's 15.5 miles let me know I'm still in the game! 
Knees gave me a little trouble during the 6.5 miles that remained of the coaster. The last 9 miles were difficult with several 5-600' climbs but without as many rocks. Knees were swollen pretty good but only ached. Same as what happened every day before the White's. Feet were definitely swollen by the time I got to camp. I'll have to remember to loosen the shoe laces.
Received word today that Tablesaw will be starting in Harper's Ferry on the 31st! Hoping he can catch me in the next few weeks! I'll be taking a few zero days and not pushing 20+ mile days till he catches me! Looking forward to hiking with him again. This time with no injuries!

Checked into a hotel after hiking to take a zero day tomorrow. It's only been 4 days of hiking but thought it might be good to let the body recover before hitting Shenandoah National Park. This section is 103 miles of great trail with several lodges and camp stores to pick up some yummy food! I hope to do a couple of 20+ mile days while in the park. Trails are well maintained and designed to keep weekend warrior hikers coming back.  At least that's what I've been told.  I've been here several times on the motorcycle, riding Skyline Drive.  Bears are plentiful in the park, so hoping I get to see a few.

I did laundry in the tub and dried it in the parking lot, walked to the grocery twice, ate crap all day, and made myself sick to my stomach. I think it was the large salad. My body didn't know what to do with vegetables!  
Did do one good deed for the day. There was a nice young couple at the hotel who were on their last few dollars, no job, and no place to sleep. I only know this from another hotel guest who really felt bad for them. He knew they would be sleeping on the street that night. I chased them down the street, where they were headed to put in more applications. I listened to their story, asked a few question, and then offered them some cash so they could spend the night in the hotel (Super 8) and have enough to get some food. Their reaction was priceless! So I doubled it. Sure hope things work out for them! There are so many others out there that need a break.

Lots of climbing, some rock scrambles, some rocky trail, and a lot of well maintained trail!  Just 13.4 miles, but if I went any further, I'll be too early to enjoy burger, fries, and a milkshake at the upcoming Wayside. lol. It's all in the timing!
I've been hiking with Pine Stick for the past couple of days. He's 72 and made it from Harper's Ferry to the Maine border before his body said enough! He took a week off and is now on his way to Springer. He's much slower than I am but walks a lot longer. He just goes till he's tired and finds a spot in the woods. 
New experience here in SNP, there are all kinds of plants that really hurt when you brush against them. It feels like you are on fire! Hand sanitizer seems to take care of the sting.  Helped a tow truck driver load a motorcycle today and he was telling me the one plant with white flowers is relatively new to the area. The darn plants are all over!
Alone here tonight at Gravel Spring where there has been a lot of bear activity. Sure hope the local bears don't have an appetite for tacos (hammocks).
Good news is that if you are reading this, I survived as cell service is weak and I won't have sent it till the next day.
It's great to be in the woods with the giant beasts and the millions of small insects that make so much noise I wear earplugs!

Wow it was good, but too much! Only ate half the fries and still suffered from full belly for the next 5 miles. Saw my 3rd bear today!  It saw me first and ran like it saw a ghost. I've noticed the same reaction from people too! lol
Trail today reminded me a lot of Pennsylvania. Lots of rocks, especially the last climb of 1200'. Wind is really wicked up here tonight. I found a couple trees fairly close to the shelter to help block the wind. I have 5 guy lines on the wind side holding the tarp. Usually I use only 2. Hoping the wind slows down or I might get a bit chilly. 
Once again I'm alone at a high bear active site. Doubt I'll have any issues as no bear in their right mind would be out with this wind!

My goal for the day was 22.4 miles but what the heck, Shenandoah won't last forever. Got a reasonable start today, stopped at Skyline Resort for lunch (turkey & cheese sandwich which was surprisingly good), then hiked another 8 miles and had dinner at the Big Meadows Lodge (Cheese Burger, small salad, and Blackberry cobbler w/ blackberry ice cream, and 2 beers). After dinner I hiked another 3.3 miles before finding a stealth spot.  I could hear thunder and knew there was 50% chance of storms so found the best place I could before it got dark. I'm lying in the hammock writing this with lots of bright light flashing in the sky. So far it seems to be several miles to the north. 
Also had time today to get to know Pine Stick better. Turns out he is a Civil Engineer who owned his own consulting firm. He's from Portland Oregon and has backpacked all over the northwest for over 40 years. 
Yikes! That one was close!! I don't know if it's the mountains, altitude (3500') or what, but dang the thunder is loud!! I've been out here in thunderstorms but nothing like this. No rain or wind, just lightning!
