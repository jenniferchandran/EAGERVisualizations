Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592834,"Walked to WF in Wellesley. 
I didn’t exactly enjoy walking along the road. Too many cars.  I felt out of place. It's also the course for the Boston marathon so there are always people training and running this road.  Also people on bikes, in full bike gear.  
I think I’ll stick with Wellesley Campus next time for hikes starting from the house. It’s a large campus with lots of trails and as a bonus all the trees and lots of plants are labeled so it’s an education at the same time.  There are trails all over Boston, or I can go west to Hopkinton, north to Maine or New Hampshire, or work up some calf muscles on any beach nearby.",,Wellesley College Campus,"Jun 03, Sun",7
Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593536,"There's a simple loop around my neighborhood that's .6 miles for each loop.  It's flat, although there's a stony hill in one of the towns public lands at the end of the street. It's about 50-60 foot elevation at about 25-30 degrees. It has a beautiful view from the top. The area is only about four city blocks but it connects to other forest land so there have been deer, coyote, fox and turkeys seen on the hill.  
This walk is great for when I'm waiting for the kids to get home from school or between loads of laundry or something like that. I can leave my water on the porch and grab some each loop around. I can work on my leg strength by looping up and down the hill. 
Also, I'm convinced there is a spring along this walk as well. There's an area that is wet part of the spring, and it dries up except for a tiny area that is always green.  The road nearby always has a puddle as well. And old maps show there was a stream there at one time. It's either a spring or a broken water pipe.  If I can find it I'd like to try out my lifestraw. 
I've been watching two youtube channels:  IB TAT and eWolf",,Natick,"Jun 08, Fri",2
Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593537,"Went back to Wellesley College. Intended to walk the 3.1 mile trail around the pond but my sister texted to ask me to call her back right away.  She just found out she has stage 3 ovarian cancer.  Shit.  I let her know that I had just scheduled a mammogram/ultrasound for breast lumps.  We are going to the same medical center near downtown Boston. 
After a conversations like that, the walk was a bit surreal. I had an exceptional amount of stress energy so I was careful not to push myself to hard. I totally missed the trail head for the loop so I just walked around campus for an hour. I saw a turtle, three swans flying over the lake, LOTS of chipmunks, squirrels and rabbits.
I made my gear list of tomorrow's REI garage sale.",,Wellesley,"Jun 08, Fri",3.10
Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593539,"Whoa. I got there at 9:30 for 10 am opening and already 30 people in line.  When the guy opened the gate, the first few people ran like it was black Friday. I realized I wasn't going to have time to browse and immediately prioritized - backpack, tent, shirts.  I grabbed the first Osprey I saw and it was the one I had been fitted for and had no damage. Sweet!  On to tents!  I grabbed an REI half-dome that was only missing a grommet. Yeah!  I picked up a fly bivy and a Columbia rain jacket.   So only 15 minutes had passed and 80 percent of the backpacks were already gone and all the small tents were gone. In the corner of the parking lot, a few people were setting up tents and trying on clothes.   
I did see / hear some more experienced campers helping out newbies others with gear sizing etc.  That was so awesome!   
Later I walked 2 miles (so pitiful!) around the neighborhood. 
I also found that the Appalachian Mountain Club has a Massachusetts Based series of hikes on the Appalachian Trail over several weekends this summer.  I would love to do these!
Also, when talking about hiking with my husband, he proposed walking from our town (Natick, MA) to the ocean (in Dorchester.) It's 17 miles.  I can already see the path in my head.",,REI,"Jun 09, Sat",2
Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593600,"Saw snapping turtle on trail that had just laid eggs.  It was trying to get back to the water. Everyone was staying clear.  I'm sure whoever is in charge of campus wildlife will get it to the water safely if it can't make it on it's own quickly.  Lots of runners on the trail.  
I couldn't imagine running anywhere with so may roots sticking out of the ground.  I like walking poles. I like taking the time to listen to birds and look at flowers.

Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595087,"Wow. What a whirlwind two weeks.  Current status: Waiting. 
Went to ER with pain in left armpit and down arm.  All labs, X-Ray and EKG normal.  ER doc says - We can tell what it's not, but have no idea what it is, please follow up with regular doctor. Follow up with regular doctor, I say that it could possibly all be just stress reaction to things going on in my life in general, but that based on symptoms, and that I've been hiking a lot in tree covered paths, may I please have a Lyme test.  So waiting for that.  
Here's what the take-away is from all this:  
1) I'm not going to let it stop me from hiking.  All things change. If it's Lyme, I'll be extra vigilant about treating myself and gear, checking for ticks, etc. Lesson learned. 
1.5) If it's not Lyme, I'll track symptoms and work at decreasing stress as much as possible. 
2) There are good days and bad days, just like for everyone.  Take them as they come.  Give your body what it needs.  
3) Be realistic. If a few days of hiking repeatedly makes me non-functional for a week - maybe hiking is not the best option for me.  I can still make trail magic and support other thru-hikers and take shorter hikes.",,Health,"Jun 23, Sat",1
Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596065,"Broadmore Wildlife Sanctuary was closed today (Monday.) So I went to Walden Pond. I've been living in the Boston area for over seven years and finally made it up there.  It was 87 at home but easily five degrees cooler at the Pond. It wasn't too crowded, however, I was very surprised that 80% of the ""heart healthy"" trail was bordered on both sides by a wire fence the width of the trail.  The trail was barely wide enough to have someone pass.  There were frightening looking one inch metal barbs on each of the metal posts.  There is no running allowed on the trails. I can see why.  One wrong step into one of those posts would be a serious injury.  I started to feel very claustrophobic about 1/2 way around the trail.  There was no sense of openness on the trail at all due to the fence.  I understand that with the high number of visitors to the park, it's not reasonable to have visitors leaving the trail.  I hope perhaps, someday they can have something that blends into the scenery as opposed to a tunnel of barbed wire! On a super-positive note - I talked to my husband and after discussing the AT for the 1,000 time in the last few months, I said, I just want to make sure it's ok with you if I do this.  He said ""I would never stop you.""  Ahhh... He knows what it's like for me to make up my mind to do something!I also added Moab 2 hiking shoes, a compass, a squishy hand therapy ball to use when I'm hiking (my hands swell and that seems to help) and a Sawyer Mini (as I've seen several people use it on AT hiking videos.)   My favorite thru-hikers this year are ewolf, IB TAT and Sleeves. Three completely different personalities and perspectives and so much fun to keep up with.",,Walden Pond,"Jul 02, Mon",1.70
Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596268,"Broadmoor Wildlife Sanctuary is amazing! Nine miles of trails!  It's been so hot I waited until seven pm to hike.  Unfortunately, I forgot to take a photo of the trail map and after hiking for about twenty minutes, the bugs were pretty bad and I was unsure of the length of the trail I was on, so I turned around and went back.  I managed pretty good keeping the bugs away using a stick I found with some leaves on it.  I will be back soon!  I walked around the neighborhood for quite a while when I got home as well.
I have surgery beginning of August for Stage O breast cancer and radiation for several weeks after.  There are other things I can work on if I have a long recovery period and fatigue, such as research gear, watch previous years thru-hike videos and read thru-hike books.",,Broadmoor Wildlife Sanctuary,"Jul 04, Wed",2
Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596886,"I hiked additional miles at Broadmore.  It was so beautiful!  
I’ve had several goals throughout my life and some where a success and some were not.    When I was sad about the failures, my husband (who is always reasonable about life) asked - “Did you learn anything?”  Which of course the answer is “yes.”
From the biggest failure I learned the most important thing - I never OWNED what I was doing.  I never proclaimed from the mountaintops “I own a recording studio!”  When people asked “what do you do?” I always replied by talking about my second job. The one that was bringing in the income to support the failing studio.   I never believed in the studio because it was a thing I was doing out of spite, out of anger - a challenge in response to someone who said I couldn’t do it.  And yet - I managed to base my entire life around accomplishing that goal.  The idea of owning a recording studio came about from my own interests in music and technology and the mystery of the gigantic mixing board.  But the ideal became warped as soon as I let someone challenged me. 
When I finally realized this, I was able to look back at my life and see this was how I often made choices.  First a spark of interest, then someone saying “there’s no way you can do that.” and poof - I was off and running to prove them wrong.  At the expense of my family, my budget, logic, etc.
It’s important to keep this in check, acknowledge this, work with it, as I train for the hike.  The other day, I told a co-worker I went for a hike, he replied “Why on earth did you do that, it’s so hot out!” I that twinge of “I’ll show you!” came creeping up.  But this time - I immediately recognized it.  I was able to take a step back and think - this idea of hiking is a part of me and not reactionary. 
The idea came from my love of hiking while living near the Smokey Mountains. The idea of a few months of keeping things very basic. The idea of being responsible for only myself.  The idea of becoming part of a moving co-op for a summer. The idea of being able to see the best of nature and the best and maybe the worst of people.  To stay healthy at 50+.  To do something other than working 8-5.  To become part of the Appalachian trail community.   To have something else to focus on while I battle cancer.

Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597256,"The best thing about today was that I hiked 5.72 miles and I had no idea I had gone that far.  I had planned on just walking a smaller trail near where I parked but I just kept going.  I got home and checked miles and it was 5.72 miles!  That's really awesome because I seriously thought I had gone maybe 2 miles.  Ok, not so good that my sense of miles was WAY off, but good that I didn't feel anything.  So strength is improving. Two other downsides: 1) I got a blister because I wore my Birkenstocks (unprepared!) and 2) it aggravated by breast and there's two more weeks before surgery. 
Positive Notes: I found a map for the ""grand trail"" a beautiful ten mile loop combining all the trails in the Wellesley area.  Also, I was able to find all the trail markers on the signs and lampposts. I had another serious talk with SO about when to hike. Discussed logistics. My son is a HS senior in the fall and is doing a gap year (hence my trail name idea.) I'd like to be available that summer to help coordinate that as it's most likely going to be overseas.  My daughter is going to be a HS freshman in the fall and while she's super mature, one more year so before I take an extended would be beneficial.  Also my SO shared his long term dream - to complete the grand tour in a boat. The one that goes from Chicago, down the Mississippi, through the gulf, around Florida, up the east coast, in at New York, around Michigan and back to Chicago. He has never been in a boat. So looks like we are a good pair.  I definitely have more experience on the water than him, even though it was just a little fishing boat in a lake!  So we can be ""surf and turf"" or ""land and sea.""  He's on a twelve year prep, mine is only two. But now we each have something to obsess over and research and look forward to.",,Sudbury Trail,"Jul 14, Sat",5.72
Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598600,"This I have learned / experienced recently:
Head nets are awesome.  Used it when I hiked near the Charles River.  I was able to completely ignore the swarm of gnats around my head.  I bought bug pants and I am going to get a bug jacket.  Otherwise, I'll just stick with long-sleeved shirts and pants.  
I took a long hike locally in the warm summer rain in my rain jacket.  Also had an umbrella until it was thundering.  It did get hot and I was sweating but it wasn't miserable.   I don't even want to think about hiking in cold rain however. 
Went for a longer hike today and the map trail location was correct, but it was not paved.  Took a road to connect back to the trail and I did NOT like walking on the road.  If a car was coming towards me, I could not hear cars behind me.  
I don't mind Rail Trails.  Sometimes I just need to know where I'm going and that's definitely the case with a Rail Trail. Also, I like alternating the accomplishment of miles vs elevation. 
Today is Saturday. Surgery is Wednesday.   I don't think that jumpy, bumpy, trails would not be a good thing for a while, so my next goal is to get back up to being able to do a ten mile hike on level ground.  Then with a 20 lb pack, then move on to the Blue Hills Sky Line Trail, a 13 mile trail with a 2799 foot elevation, rock scrambles and other fun stuff!  
At the last REI Garage Sale, I picked up some REI hiking poles.  Yeah!

Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598804,"Today I did the 5.4 skyline loop trail in the Blue Hills Reservation near Boston.  It was awesome!  It was up and down and up and down and many rocky areas. Had to scoot on my butt on lots of the downhill areas.  
Things I learned on this hike:  
I took 1.5 liters of water and drank it all at 3/4 of the way though the hike. I'm wondering if I had started more hydrated, if that would have helped.  It was 85 degrees and slightly humid. There were no water sources on the trail.  Well, there was some gross brackish water and there were parts of the trail that obviously have water flowing at times. 
Also, I had my trekking poles, but I prefer to use one.  I like to have one hand free to grab trees and rocks.  I prefer climbing on rocks that tree roots.  Roots scare me because I know how easy it is to get caught on them. 
I really spent a lot of time looking for the best place to walk.
This trail was considered moderate. LOL. I can't wait to try the ""strenuous"" trail. There are miles and miles of trails and looks like this is going to be an excellent place to get my trail legs.
When I got home after 45 minute drive, I was only mildly sore in the bottom of my feet. I bet if I had been able to lie down that wouldn't have happened.",,Blue Hills Blue Blazes Skyline Loop,"Jul 30, Mon",5.40

Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601960,"Today I got my confirmation for my ""Beginner Backpack Hiking Trip"" for later this month.  It costs about as much as a nice tent, but I'm glad to be able to go out with a other beginners.  The AMC requests that I hike 4-6 times a week with full gear to prep for trip.  The kids just went back to school and I think I'm going to start radiation therapy soon.  I'm not sure how it's all going to work out, but it will. I'm going to change my trail name to Zotz!   Zotz! are a hard candy that has a fizzy center.  They are kinda hard to find in stores.  I usually order them at Halloween and people always make comments about how much they love them and ask where I got them (Amazon.)   So today, I finally set up the used tent I got at the REI garage sale.  After setting it up, I climbed inside to check it out.  It smelled of campfire and was full of sand.   I picked up some scraps of paper in the corner and one of them was a Zotz! wrapper!  So cool.",,View Entry,"Sep 01, Sat",0
Zotz!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603485,"I had to have surgery again. I was crushed that I had to cancel my beginner backpacking class in the White Mountains put on by the AMC as I didn't know how long I'd be out of commission.  Last time it was three weeks before I started to feel back to normal.  The 2nd surgery turned out to be not nearly as complicated.  I was back up to six miles on Saturday (four days!)  That was soooooo much better than last time.  There were at least 12 swans on the lake today. That's a Bevy of Swans.  
I spent the day creating an ebay listing for my beloved classical guitar. It's the only funds I have to buy gear for the hike.  It's ok though.  The guitar, if thought of as potential, has previously been recording studio gear and a 401K fund.  Now it's going to be an adventure. The guitar's name is Venus. Somehow I knew when I bought it, I would only be it's temporary owner and it was just a placeholder to get me to the next adventure.  
I have the next to days off work because I thought I was going to be out of commission from the surgery for three weeks and I'm just not on the schedule yet.  
I bought a 70L backpack I really liked but it made a swish swish swish noise when I was hiking, and I found it much less price on Amazon, so I returned it. I'm not sure if that noise would drive me crazy while hiking so I never ended up buying it again.  Also, hyperlite is only 2 hours away so I'm hesitant to buy another one until I can visit their shop. 
Maybe tomorrow I'll drive up there.",,View Entry,"Sep 23, Sun",0

I officially put in for time off at work.  Last week of April.  I've been talking about people who hike the Appalachian Trail to a co-worker, without telling her my plans. She likes to hike but thinks it's crazy to thru-hike.  Had an issue with my knee but it's gone now.  Just enough to remind me to be careful.  Had no idea what I did, but it was swollen for about two weeks.  The area I had surgery is always sore, but hasn't prevented me from hiking.  Once I was told (regarding pregnancy) nine months in, nine months out - meaning one should expect the body to recover for nine months.  I'm thinking that way about the surgeries / radiation.  It was five months from 1st surgery to end of radiation.  So, five months out would be June.  I just need to keep that in mind when I get tired.",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Sun",6
