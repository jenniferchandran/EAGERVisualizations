Turned out that a fire alarm required evacuation and a check of all rooms by the fire marshal. Whew, after about 40 minutes, all were allowed back in. Fabulous view of the mountains and sunset from our room. Earlier, we checked out the Falls from the top.  Hiked all of the steps going up the Falls ten years ago on my first section hike; in this case, once will be enough :) I'll  start the Approach trail tomorrow from above the falls.Thank you, Tom, for driving!",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Sat",0

There was a heavy downpour nearing the top of Blood Mountain so no views.

Some steep drop offs even before the short, but steep ""bouldering"" section near the top.  Loved it!  Still afraid of heights so only got to second level of steps on the fire tower but still had good views.  Cloudy and cool by the time reached Long Branch Shelter which ended up full - both shelter and tenting.

Then an hour later a beast (most likely a bear) woke me with loud snuffling near my small tent.  Clapped my hands twice sharply and it bounded off.  Then there were deer.  First a young buck calmly watched me pack up my gear in the pre-dawn hours - he was only about 10 feet away!  Then in the afternoon , saw 2 does in open woods next to the trail.  Was also delighted to see wildflowers.  Bluets are particularly charming.","Birch Spring campsite 113

While taking a break at Derrick Knob shelter who should appear but Dan, now Jet.  He recognized my big yellow backpack, a Go Lite classic I should say.

Near Clinton's Dome some very kind ladies from Mississippi offered me a cold Dr Pepper and a snack ( I was hoping/looking in vain for a soda vending machine.) Thank you!  I was revitalized.
Mt Collins shelter area is very nice and suited to tenting.  Threat of rain passed so dry another day.  Pretty tired but did eat something today.","Silars Bald (#108)

Nice historic marker at Indian Gap (main road before Newfound Gap built in the 1930s ). Can't imagine how hard it was back then to cross these beautiful mountains.  
I could have sworn that the guidebook indicated water at Newgound Gap. Did not find any.  Bathrooms had flush toilets but no sinks. No water fountain. Luckily a nice family from Louisville KY offered me a cold water bottle. Thank you!  Later I was able to get some water from a seasonal runoff over mossy rocks. (I am getting very fond of the Sawyer filter) Ended up with sufficient water to get to the shelter.

  ""2 Mountain Lions"" walked with me for over an hour ("" it feels good to hike slowly for a change"" - lol) before heading off.  Not long afterwards I did a partial face plant after tripping on something on an old graded woods road.  That's what happens when your mind wanders.  Bent eye glasses, a few scrapes (nothing needing stitches except my ego.)

The trail the follows the river for a bit before sharply climbing the cliffs. Instead of hiking, I'm taking photos and admiring the views.

Good hiking for a couple of hours before the rain started again.  Took bypass trail around Bald Mountain overlook.  Heard how gorgeous the views are from the bald but today all was socked in a dense fog.  The bypass trail rejoined at The Stamp.
