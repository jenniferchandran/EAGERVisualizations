Monkey Wrench ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625624,"I have arranged transportation to Springer Mountain, GA (the southern terminus of the AT) on April 29-31 via AMTRAK and Ron’s Appalachian Trail Shuttle. I plan to start the trail northbound (NOBO) on April 1st and to hike as far as I comfortably can for about one month. As April 30 approaches, I hope to locate an exit to a location from which I can arrange transportation home. While on the AT, I hope to post photos and commentary about my hike on this site. Love and Best Wishes to all who may follow it. You may access it directly at www.trailjournals.com/GaryMcBride Monkey Wrench",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Mon",0

Monkey Wrench ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625871,"Today I hiked four miles at elevations ranging from 8200’ to 8500’ above the Vail Valley. The first climb was a bit of a struggle, but it became progressively mor comfortable with the final steep 1.2 mile climb barely noticeable. I was pleased with it as a first training hike, but have far to go to be ready for my AT start on April 1.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Mon",0
Monkey Wrench ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626066,"Since arriving at Avon, CO I have completed one 3 mile hike, two 4 mile hikes and one 10 mile hike. The shorter ones were at elevations ranging from 8350’ to 8600’; the 10 mile hike ranged from 8100’ to 8600’. Extending it to 20 miles will add very little variation because the additional 10 miles are back and forth through Avon and along the Eagle River to Edwards, CO and back. I alternate with skiing which helps with balance but not significantly with conditioning. Love you all!",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Mon",0
