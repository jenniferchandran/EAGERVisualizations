Jackwagon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626754,"We are staying in Dahlonega tonight. It's about an hour drive to the parking area that's on FS road 42, about one mile north of Springer. Bill and I are going to slack-pack the mile south to the top of Springer, then pick up our packs when we get back to the parking area. We decided to skip the approach trail. Bill has done it before, and I'm choosing not to do it because of the stairs. I don't have much interest in that. Bill is using my old Lowe Alpine pack, and when we were fitting it to him tonight, the waist strap buckle broke. I ran to Walmart and got the last repair kit off the hook to fix it. Very lucky they had it. His pack is ready to go. Breakfast tomorrow at 7, on the trail at 9. One mile up to Springer, then the same mile back, then we will go north about 8 more miles. I'll be keeping my mileage low for the first couple of weeks to keep from getting any overuse injury right off the bat. I'll miss sharing this with Wendy full-time, but will keep her posted as I go along, hopefully finding a place daily where we can talk.",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Mon",0
Jackwagon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626895,"I started early this morning, around 7. I was alone on the trail for the first few miles. The woods was quiet except for a few birds and the sloshing of my boots in the mud. It has been raining off and on since I started on Tuesday. I’ve gone about 8 miles per day. I hadn’t planned to do more than that for about the first week. I want to keep from getting an overuse type of injury early on. I think that I’ve gotten through the “what the heck am I doing” phase and now getting into the flow. I’m staying tonight in a cabin that a few other hikers are sharing. That way I can get a shower and sleep in a dry spot. It’s funny how some normal things seem like such a treat when you don’t have them all the time. I’ll post again in a couple days where I should have good phone service again.","

Jackwagon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627041,"Hi Everyone, I have had a great week on the AT, but I have just gotten off the trail for some time, maybe a couple weeks. Wendy is concerned about the social implications of the corona virus and wants me to be home for a bit so she will be more comfortable with the situation. She fully supports me being on the trail, but she is the most important part of my life, and the trail will always be there. I plan to return to the AT as soon as possible. I appreciate everyone's expressions of congratulations and support for my start, and I will be providing an update when I return to the trail.
I am turning off my location tracking app but will start it again when I’m back to hiking.
I hope everyone takes this time to draw closer to family and friends and to help others as they can.","

Jackwagon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632732,"I am starting on the AT again on Monday, 2/22 at Unicoi Gap, Georgia. This is where I left last year due to Covid. At the time that I got off the trail, I thought that I would be getting back on a couple weeks later. As everyone knows, this turned into a much longer event that I (or anyone, I think) had planned at the time. I have reviewed the safety options regarding hiking the AT, and I believe that the plans that I have will keep me safe, and keep people I contact on the trail and in local towns safe as well. Wendy is again fully supportive of my return to this hike. I appreciate her love and assistance as I have gotten things ready to start again. ","Unicoi Gap

Jackwagon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632761,"The past couple of days has been along the lines of Dickens it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.I love being back on the trail but my legs aren’t truly ready for it yet. Weather has been great, today started around freezing, but warmed up to 60 with sunny, cloudless skies. I pushed it a bit too hard yesterday and I paid for it today. I hope that a good rest tonight and plenty of liquids will help tomorrow.Everything feels good, except for being tired. No blisters, knock on wood (and there’s plenty of that around).  Tim","Tray Shelter

Jackwagon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632819,"Had a few good days of weather until today.  It rained most of the day.  Arrived at Carter Gap Shelter, set up my tent and changed into dry clothes.  Spent some time in my sleeping bag to get warm.  This is a longer section with no place to recharge my phone, so I will not be keeping it on the next day or two.  If you are following me on the trail, I am planning to get to Winding Stair Gap on Sunday.  I'll get a ride into Franklin and spend the night at a hotel.  I need to refresh my food supply.  My nephew Curt will pick me up in Frankin on Monday and give me a ride back to Winding Stair Gap.  ","

Jackwagon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632835,"After a very rainy and cold night, the weather cleared through the day. Albert Mountain was a chore, but I’m feeling myself getting stronger on the uphills. There was a good amount of downhills today too so I made the decision to head into Franklin NC to restock food, fuel for my stove, and power for my phone. I’m also going to do laundry and need to pick up a hiking pole. I’ve only been using one because the other one was missing a screw on the adjusting clip , making it unusable. Wendy will be bringing the fixed pole when she meets me next but it’s not working out as well with only one. I should be able to get one at Walmart that will work for the interim. I’m trying to figure out how to upload photos tomorrow. ","Carter Gap Shelter

Jackwagon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632843,"I found out that I can’t add photos from my phone on trailjournals.com.  I’ll be setting up my journal on a different site next week when Wendy visits me at Fontana Dam, NC because she will have our laptop with her. When it’s set up, I’ll post the url here. ","

Jackwagon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632858,"I am sad that I’ll be coming off the trail tomorrow, probably for good. I have developed a foot problem called Morton’s Neuroma. It’s a condition where two bones in the foot are compressed together and squeeze a nerve between them. I’ve had one in my right foot for several years and have treated it using superfeet insoles and felt pads that are made for it. That one has mostly been fine, but now a neuroma has also developed in my left foot. Based on my experience with my right foot, I expect that it will take a good amount of time to get it under control to where I could hike again. 
Wendy will be picking me up in the morning to head back home. 
I have had some great experiences, met some great people, and I’ve had fun. I’m sure that I will hike again, but not sure that I could take on this type of long-distance hike in the future. 
Thank you to everyone who has been so supportive and encouraging as I’ve planned, started, stopped due to the pandemic, and started again. It’s great to have such a good group of friends. Above all, thank you to Wendy for being there for me as I’ve been absorbed in getting ready and working on one of my dreams. She has never faltered in her support. One benefit of leaving the trail is that we can spend more time together than we expected!  😀","Winding Stair Gap
