Just Jim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626909,"I first stepped foot on the Appalachian Trail in the summer of 1977. Even as a young man, the AT held a certain power over me. Most of my life I have spent my spare time in the mountains whether it be a family vacation, fishing trip, backpacking trip or something  along those lines. Heading to the mountains does not soothe  my desire to be there, but instead it makes me want to return that much more. After many trips up and down the AT, in different states, I have decided I am going to attempt my own northbound thru-hike of the AT this spring. I am looking forward to sharing this journey.",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Fri",0
Just Jim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627173,"Tick tock, tick tock. I am down to my last couple of days before I depart on my adventure. I have been waiting on this for a few months, my departure date could not get here fast enough. I am starting to feel anxious now that the time is near. I have packed and unpacked my pack two or three times  the last few days. I keep adding things, then removing them. And removing other items, only  to return them. I am very pleased with the equipment I have chosen,  but I am starting to have second and third doubts? I am certain this just is my anxiety kicking in. I am so ready to hit the trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Fri",0
Just Jim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627197,"OK, it looks like the big day is finally here. I will be headed to Amicalola Falls State Park in 16 hours. Here is the majority of what I will be carrying on the trail. I swapped out my old Kelty external frame pack for an osprey 65 L internal pack. It’s taking a little getting used to, but I think it is going to be a great pack for this adventure. I got a new set of Leki hiking poles, my old ones had a lot of miles on them. I swapped out my MSR hubba one person tent for a Nemo hornet two person tent. It is much larger, and half the weight. I got rid of my Kelty down Phil’s sleeping bag. I switched over to a Hammock Gear 20° quilt. It is much lighter, and takes up less space. I am using a Thermarest neo x air. It is 3 inches thick, 6 foot long, and then R-value of 4. It is much lighter than my last pad, and larger. All of my older gear was fine 10 to 12 years ago when I purchase it, but there is much smaller and lighter products available now. The only thing I am going heavy on is my food. I plan on carrying an extra four to five days to be safe. All this buying up everything in the store is out of fear on account of this COVID-19 virus. I need to keep some extra food on hand. That’s all for now, my next post should be from the arch.",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Sat",0

I came here for a little while in 1988. I did not know I would spend 32 years of my life here.I bounced around the country a lot in the 80’s, I have always said that where I lay my head is home. I love traveling and seeing new places. We live in such a beautiful country, it’s a shame most people do not explore it. I prefer the remote areas, away from crowds.

We walked a half a mile so we could all see Amicalola Falls. That was an incredible site. The pictures on the net do not do the falls any justice at all. After a few hugs and kisses and saying goodbye, I walked to the base of the Falls to start climbing up the 750 or so steps to the top. That was a leg burning climb, And I paid for it the rest of the afternoon.I hiked 7.3 miles this evening, and camped at Black gap shelter. I am 1 mile below the summit of  Springer Mountain. My legs have not burned like this in a very long time, probably not since basic training back in 1984. The wind is really picking up, and I can hear some thunder in the distance.

I got a good nights sleep at Black Gap shelter, and woke up this morning to thunderstorms and heavy rain. My legs are very sore, and filled with lactic acid from yesterday’s climb out of Amicalola. I am sore, and slipping often on some of these wet rocks. I can feel the strain on my hips, and I have decided to get off the trail and take a zero tomorrow in the town of Blairsville.I want to dry out some wet gear, and I am going to get rid of a few items, and add one or two things that I have decided I need. They are calling for heavy storms tonight and again tomorrow, so I think I am making the right decision. I do not mind cold or rain, but they are not a lot of fun when you put them together. I am looking forward to a hot shower and meal, and then a quick trip to the local outfitter to pick up a few things. That will wrap up the rest of today.","Black Gap shelter

I felt great after taking a much needed zero in Blairsville. I removed some items from my pack, giving me some free space and shaved a few pounds off of my total weight. There are 10 of us camped around the shelter. This is the most people I have seen since hitting the trail. I am getting ready to cook some supper, and get some rest.

There were a few steep sections, but the views from the highest point on the trail in Georgia was well worth it. After a nice lunch on top, it was a fairly easy two miles downhill to Neels gap. I stopped at Mountain Crossings, and took them up on their offer for a “gear shakedown”. Most of my gear is dialed in, however I am using a much heavier pack than needed. I just bought a mariposa 60 pack from Gossamer Gear. I hated spending almost $300 on a pack two months after buying a $300. pack, but it was the right decision. This pack is 2.5 pounds lighter, and more compact. It should fit my needs a lot better.","Lance Creek

I feel selfish saying that, there are a lot bigger problems in the world right now than my hike. This is a picture of my “ tramily”, or trail family. We all met on the second day, and have stuck together since then. The first and third girl from the left are Hannah and Sharon. They are from Australia. They are currently in San Francisco, and will fly back to Australia on Thursday. The second girl from the left is Carissa. After a 20 Hour road trip yesterday, she drove back to Fayetteville and is now home safe. Aaron is on the right. We drove him to Akron Ohio yesterday, and came right back to Georgia. Most are getting off the trail and going home. There are a lot of closures, making this hike difficult. I will be getting back on the trail in the morning. My goal is to make it to Franklin, North Carolina in the next 10 days. If I can get that far, I suppose I will get off the trail and wait a few weeks for everything else open back up?

I am not sure when the smokies will open back up, so I have decided to jump ahead to Davenport Gap, just north of the smokies and mile 241 on the AT. It looks like I should have no problem hiking to Damascus,VA. That is 230 miles, that should keep me busy for a while.

I had to get off the trail several times, and I had to shuttle around Smokies on account of the closures. I will be returning to Neels gap this morning, mile 31.9 on the AT. This is where all five of my trail family and I got off the trail together one month ago. Carissa has returned, and will be joining me at Neels  so she can pick up where she left off. Georgia is almost back to normal, everything in North Carolina is still closed for now.

Between my feet pounding the rocks walking down an almost vertical trail, with weight on my back is starting to take its toll.

I have always wanted to come and experience  some of the German culture here.I drank a couple of really great beers, that I cannot spell or pronounce. I also indulged in some traditional German food. It was absolutely delicious. Helen is a very photogenic town, and I took plenty of pictures. You would think you were in a Bavarian village up in the mountains of Germany 100 years ago.

Shortly after arriving at camp, five Amish men walked in to camp. We introduced ourselves, made small talk, then started putting our tents up and cooking. They are doing a two week section hike, logging some serious miles. They do this every year, and are well known on the trail. They are known as the “Amish Mafia”. After eating, we talked around a fire for quite a while. It was interesting hearing about their culture, and answering questions about ours. I wish we could have spent a few more evenings together.

The view was worth every minute of the climb. There is an old fire tower on top of the mountain, and the view was terrific.

Four miles into the hike was an option to take a side trail to a tower on Rich Mountain. It was steep, but well worth it. The view was incredible. Right before reaching the shelter, I had my first bear encounter. It was not as fun as I expected it to be. I walked around a bend, and was face to face with a mother bear and two cubs. The cubs climbed a tree quickly, while the mother and I had a staring contest. After a few minutes she went about her business, and I did the same. I was lucky enough to record the encounter.

It was unlike anything I've came across on the trail so far. It was an alpine environment, and home to a few endangered plants and animals. We took a short side trail to visit Roan Knob Shelter. At 6,275 feet above sea level, it is the highest shelter on the entire Appalachian Trail. The air is very cool up there. We stopped for lunch, and started shivering before too long. We had to start walking again soon. Our destination for the evening was the Overmountain Shelter. It is a very old barn that has housed many hikers over the years. You are no longer allowed to sleep in it. It has been condemned. We pitched our tents in a field near the barn. The view was great until the fog rolled in. That is all for now.","Hughes Gap Road

We walked a side trail to Jones Falls. It was a very nice waterfall, and worth walking to. It rained on and off all day. We were soaked when we got to camp. It was also almost dark, cold, and we were out of water. After getting water, we decided to just sleep in the shelter. There was another couple in there sleeping when we showed up. We tried our best to be quiet while getting ready for bed. It doesn't do much good. It is very quiet out here at night, causing everything you do to sound so much louder than it really is.
