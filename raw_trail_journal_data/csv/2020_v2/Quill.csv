Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630404,"2020. What can I say? Starting later and doing less of the trail this year than hoped... because Covid. On a bright note it also means I am just in time to join 3 folks from my 2019 hike that I still consider my ""tramily."" I can't wait to cover some trail with Doppler, Queue and Nails who have started their section 4 days ago. This trip is sort of spontaneous for me and not in the order I envisioned. I originally thought of doing sections in order, in a long straight line from start to finish. In retrospect I am so glad I began at Springer last year and had a first trail experience that included everything the AT is known for: community, generosity, perseverance, weather, OTT (on trail training.) I would absolutely advise beginning at the beginning. And I want to end at the end. It's the middle that I'm feeling flexible about. I plan to hike every mile and every blaze, but here I go making a swiss cheese of the trail by skipping from Hot Springs to Shenandoah NP. I blame it on 2020 and the strong desire to reconnect with my trail peeps.Haven't changed my gear much but plan to try my Altras this time rather than my Keens. As usual I am carrying too much food. Oh well!",,View Entry,"Sep 05, Sat",0
Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631339,"Glorious to be in the mountains again! It is a decent road trip from Atlanta to Shenandoah National Park but I have wings. I can't wait to be on trail, feel the pack weight, push up to views and find that weary sense of peace at night. I enter the park at the start of a holiday weekend with fingers crossed that my friends have found a campsite at Loft Mountain where they've walked in going Nobo from the Southern border of the park. They are a few days into the hike and I admit I've been watching their progress with some envious impatience to get there. 
Loft Mountain Campground has over 200 sites and every one of them is taken when I arrive at the gate. Luckily our group has snagged one of the very last ones and it is large enough for 3 tents. It is such a sweet sight to see Doppler and Queue and Nailed-It. I quickly set up my tent as dusk falls. It is chilly and Doppler builds a campfire. Tomorrow it is back to the trail-life.","home

Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631341,"We are down one man, our only man. During the first days of the SNP hike, Doppler developed the worst blisters on his ankles I have ever seen--the size of half a playing card, gruesomely deep and juicy looking. The pain has changed his gate and is making him limp noticeably. We got a telemed consult from my hubby and the tough decision was that Doppler needed to zero. He will try to grab our campsite for another day and he will use my car to slack pack us until he can rejoin the trail. So my day 1 on trail is just us ladies: Queue, Nailed-It, and me.
The trail passes through Loft Mountain Campground so it's an easy entry from our campsite. The trail is lovely, the sky a cloudless blue, and it's crisp but not cold. There are more flowers than I imagined I would see in September: asters, tall yellow daisies, frothy white clusters of something, and more. Sometimes the trail is positively aflutter with butterflies and bees darting from flower to flower. We also see lots of deer crossing the path and grazing nearby. Parts of the SNP have old apple groves and the deer know where each of those old trees are.
Virginia is definitely not flat. There are some steep climbs up to cliffs and views. Doppler is the best shuttle driver. He is right on time to meet us at Pinefield Gap in my car. Only 7.2 miles but a fabulous day.","

Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631342,"Doppler's ankle blisters aren't looking great. One is beginning to dry but the other is dark and seeping. Another telemed consult ends with a directive to ""debride"" the wound, which means remove the dead tissue, which means a surgical procedure on trail. It sounds awful, but we can do this. Otherwise Doppler is going to need to make an emergency room visit. We make a run to town for sterile supplies (bandages, saline solution, polysporin, kling wrap, etc.) Hubby calls in a round of antibiotics. These blisters are no joke!
After a nice burger dinner in town we head back to our campsite and set up our surgical space: the picnic table. We have a very sharp pocket knife and tweezers, tissues for a sterile field on the table, hand sanitizer to treat the instruments, and our town supplies. I hold the dead tissue with tweezers and Queue trims the margins with the knife until a large raw patch is exposed. We clean it, add a layer of poly and a bandage. Doppler is officially off trail for a while.
He agrees to slack pack us until his blisters are dry and he can rejoin the trail. My car becomes a lucky lifeboat. Doppler drops us at Pinefield Gap for day 2. Some of the trail is dense with vegetation, just a crease in the green to show where it is. Trail maintenance has been spotty with the Covid restrictions. In some ways I love the lushness of it, but it can feel like wading through high water too. A gorgeous, beautiful day but a storm is brewing...","Pinefield Gap

Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631343,"A glorious day, but 2"" of rain predicted overnight. Doppler is in charge of finding a room at the Big Meadows Lodge while we hike. Concierge service on trail is kinda nice. His ankles are looking so much better but nowhere near ready for boots. Another day of ups and downs, rolling terrain and amazing fields of flowers. We walk for half a mile in a superbloom of head-high yellow daisies, a mile in knee high ruffles of delicate pink sprays of flowers, a wedding style aisle of white froth. But you have to be vigilant for the stinging nettle tucked into those sweet flowers. Sometimes a soft green field is actually a mean superbloom of nettle that feels like fiberglass when it brushes your skin. Potty break at your own risk...","High Top Parking Lot

Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631344,"We have relocated to the Big Meadows Lodge. Lots of rain in the forcast and we are due a shower. We pack and transfer everything to the car. Doppler drops us at Bear Fence and will meet us at the lodge later in the day, which will be a shorter one. Today is a showcase of mushrooms and deer along the ridgetops. The does have young ones in tow, some with fading spots on their flanks. The fawns are curious and nearly walk right up to greet us before Mama calls them back. We spotted 2 bright orange Shenandoah Salamanders, rare and endangered. Amazing view from Blackrock Viewpoint as we pulled into the Lodge. A hearty dinner in the dining room with a scoop of blackberry ice-cream, then a shower and comfy bed. Glad not to be sheltering in the rain!","Bear Fence

Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631345,"Woke to a deep foggy mist. Everything is dripping and blurred like a watercolor painting. It's a great day to look at spider webs! They are silvery beaded nets along the path and easier to avoid when in the path. Silk blazing is the act of ""breaking"" the webs on a trail in the morning and we've seen some creative ways of trying to knock them down before you face plant into them. I use a hiking pole to swipe the air ahead of me, Queue puts on a hat and drops her chin. We saw a guy who wore his umbrella. Either way they are usually hard to see, but the mist makes them appear so clearly. Their architecture is varied and we have fun finding the various ones. Our favorite is a tunnel spider who creates a net wall and a collection platform with a tunnel at the back complete with a leaf door. Bugs collide with the wall, fall to the platform and she dashes out of the rear hole to grab her prey. Ingenious.
This part of the trail traverses some scree fields of rocky tumbles left by old glaciers. Nailed It is from PA and warns that the AT in her state looks a lot like this. Slow going over the tippy, unstable rocks but the fog burned off and we got a nice last part of the day. Staying the night in Luray at a hotel.","Big Meadows Lodge

Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631347,"My last day on the trail and it's a rainy one. Doppler is still recovering but his blistered area is definitely healing and closing in with new skin. Guess our surgery was a success! He will probably be back on trail after I leave. It's been nice hiking with Queue and Nailed It, but I feel bad that Doppler had to sit out a section and shuttle us around. Sometimes the best you can do is listen to your body and do the right thing by it.
Rain sprinkles off and on. I started with a jacket but pretty quickly took it off. It's just too hot. I hacked a small, folding umbrella by removing the large plastic knob and replacing with a champagne cork. It works well in intermittent rain: just grab it from the pack pouch, open in seconds and carry for the minutes it rains, then tuck back in the pocket. Much more efficient and quick. There were wild raspberries blooming on the ridgetops with little thimble-sized fruits. Sweet and tart and fun to graze on along the way. We would have had none if it hadn't been raining because the birds would have found them earlier than we did. There weren't a lot of views but we were treated to a huge rainbow over the Valley. Had lunch at Bird Nest Hut #3--leftovers from Nailed It's dinner last night, a delicious stuffed sandwich that turned out to be the size of a large frying pan rather than a personal size. 
We ran into a family of 6 that is nearly finished hiking the whole trail: Mom and Dad and 4 kids ages 4-10. The youngest Netteburg girl hikes in a wonder woman costume and her sister likes her fairy princess dress with hiking boots. The two boys carry small packs but Mom and Dad have very large packs. Truly amazing. They've done a lot of slack packing and staying in hotels and hostels with the kiddos. More than one way to hike this thing. I'll be following as they finish in my home state in October. Over the week we've also run into a lot of other SOBOs: Toe, Cornflake, Orange Salamander, Table Saw, among others. 
At the end of the day Doppler meets us and I drop them at a hostel in Luray. They will keep going as a group. Doppler's foot is just about ready to accept a boot again. I'll spend the night at a friend's house in the Valley before the long drive home. A wonderful section but never enough.","Little Stony Man
