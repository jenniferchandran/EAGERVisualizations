Bhakti Jim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582333,"I have planned a thru-hike once before. My mental attachments to home helped me fail. 
For this hike, planned well in advance, I will be without Wife, House, Job and Family. Wife will be ex-Wife, Family is grown and I am selling the house I have lived in for 30+ years.
I have been a programmer since the late 1970's. I suspect I will be able to find a job when needed. 
At the time of this hike I will be 67 years old, drawing Social Security, paying for Medicare and I hope free!",,"Dallas, Texas","Jan 23, Tue",0
Bhakti Jim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582334,"I have hiked some on the AT, starting in the 1960's. I have done sections in New Hampshire, Maryland and Georgia.
Backpacking at Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimarron, New Mexico started my love of hiking. A trek at Philmont consists of 11 days on the trail starting and finishing at base camp, about 6,700 ft altitude. 
My first Philmont hike was in 1967 with canvas packs, canvas tarps and two handed axes for firewood. We did have dehydrated food them but it all pretty much tasted the same. My hike was over 50 miles and in those days that was enough to earn the 50 Miler award. 
As an Adult I have returned as an Adviser on 4 treks; 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2015. I have hiked with 1 son and 2 daughters out there. We all made it and had a stunning time. It is beautiful country, with big mountains but little air! I could tell without looking when we crossed the 9000' boundary.
Along the way I have had a few hikes on the AT and a couple on the Ouachita Trail in Arkansas and Oklahoma.",,"Dallas, Texas","Jan 23, Tue",0
Bhakti Jim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582475,"Like many, old retired guys I will step on the trail after cleaning up a lifetime of other stuff. Stuff is a good word for it. You can find it in the King James Bible! 
All those things that were once important. All the projects, complete or not. All the things you were going to do but just ran out of time (life?)   There they are and it is time to clean up this mess and not leave it for the kids. I am luckier than most. I am healthy, active and working. I don't have much put away for the future but hey, I have spent it as I lived. Generally our kids are healthy, though one daughter has serious  health problems. We did what we were supposed to do for them. 
My wife and I, as of this writing are still married but that will end soon. Financially and otherwise it is time. We are certainly still friends. When she asked why I did not go give the AT I explained that I would not go so long as my dear friend cat, yes real cat, was still alive. Since she needs someone to take care of her, my commitment. My wife has graciously promised to care for and love my cat! How much more can a man ask? 
So my clock is ticking. I am trail running again, riding road bikes for serious distances, watching my health and trimming my weight. A 2 year approach trail if you will. 
I'll ad some photos of this life for now.",,"Dallas, Texas","Jan 28, Sun",0
Bhakti Jim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582597,"My goal for the hike is to complete the AT. I feel my best chance to do that is recognize my age and ability. I am planning my hike without deadlines. If it takes 5 months or 9 months I'll be happy. Planning and logistics will get adjusted as I go. If I have to break the hike into two years, that is okay by me. I just want to finish and see it all.
I will start in Harper's to remove the Northern time restrictions and to give myself an easier ramp up time. I have hiked out of Harper's through Maryland before. They are beautiful woods with closely spaced shelters. My plan is now to start around April 15 but that is just a guideline. I will adjust for weather. Maine is the target for July or August. I vacationed in New England much of my life and understand about ""black flys"". I am an AMC member and will enjoy as many of the huts in the Whites as I can while there. They are in the budget, at least they are now!
The fall leg will be Harper's to Springer. I am a little hesitant about hitting hunting season in the south but I will adjust my attire as needed. If I am able to avoid injuries on the first leg I should be a darn good shape to knocking out the miles of Northern Virginia.  It would not break my heart if I need to do this half in a following year. I think it would be great to meet the wave of NOBOs.",,"Dallas, Texas","Jan 31, Wed",0
Bhakti Jim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582654,"Well, well, I may not get my 2 year ramp up. Some changing family issues may require that I sell the house much earlier than I planned. If that happens I will move up my hike date to 2019. I am already training as I normally do to maintain my health. I will add more hikes and camping then scale back long distance bicycle rallies a bit. After my annual Hotter'n Hell ride (hh100.org) I will focus on backpacking in case next year is the year.
See ya up the trail folks!",,"Dallas, Texas","Feb 03, Sat",0
Bhakti Jim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582731,"As I prepare for my adventure I realized that much of my life has been clouded by fantasy and I probably missed a bit of reality along the way. Age gives you a perspective that would be hard to grasp when younger and full of dreams. Most of my dreams have faded and gone. That is the normal process. I have had a full life and plan to live right up until the last moment.
Can I change my day to day view to be focused on now and today? Can I be awakened in time for my thru-hike? 
The physiological challenges are more manageable than those between my ears. Through the use of Eastern and Western practices I suspect I can train my thoughts and outlook just as I must train my body. I hope I can and will. We shall see!",,"Dallas, Texas","Feb 07, Wed",0
