Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626753,"The most challenging thing about writing something like this is where to start. It's sometimes called ""fear of the blank page."" This just feels appropriate right now. You can't know where to start until you know where you're going. And you can't know where you're going until you're already on the path.
The train ride has been interesting so far. The passengers on the train seem for the most part like any random collection of people except that they might have one little thing off about them. Some quirk or quality that would cause the average Joe to look just a little sideways at them. And I am starting to believe the description fits me pretty well. Unlike other groups of people there isn't any other cohesive element about this group.
On the flip side of things, this morning I watched the sun rise over a mountain with a small slow moving river in the foreground. The gentle water reflected the colors of the sky but only dimly so as not to overwhelm the scene.
One of the train stops was in Cumberland, MD. Most people reading will not know that Cumberland is my mother's hometown. As I was looking out the window, I could swear I saw my great-grandparents' little brick house. Of course I hadn't been to that house in nearly 30 years so it's likely I don't remember it as well as I think I do. Just being in that city again had an air of strange nostalgia to it. Not exactly like I myself grew up there, but I did visit nearly every year (some years a couple times) throughout my childhood. I've been long time unaware that I would ever find occasion to return.
DC was something else! The weather was perfect and it was a great way to break up 25 hours of train-sitting to be able to walk around that iconic city. I was particularly amused by how 2/3 of the people I passed on the street were obviously tourists or school-age kids on a field trip. But the rest of the people were government types talking about all sorts of official business from the CDC response to COVID-19 to some obscure committee procedure breach. Not sure if it was the committee or the procedure that was obscure, but I suspect it was both. Just an interesting respite amid a looong travel day.
Hopefully I can get a little more sleep this evening as tomorrow is going to be long, wet, and nearly vertical.",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Mon",0
Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627073,"It was a coooold and rainy night..... Actually it's not that cold.The day started with the arrival of the train being delayed by 45 minutes. When planning today out, I was excessively worried about getting started early, so I could arrive at my preferred shelter and get a spot. So not hitting the trail until 10:45 was a little disappointing.
But I set out anyway as I had to do something. Even starting 2hrs later than planned I covered 11.6 miles in 7 hours and arrived at the exact time I had originally planned for anyway. Conditions weren't perfect, but they turned out to be better than you might think for 50 degrees and raining. The trail turned to a mudslide, and where once I believed I would make it 2200 miles without ever falling over... I think I made it about 8. Oof!
Going to bed at 8pm, because I barely slept on the train. Hopefully today's fun will put me out quickly.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627075,"Today was long and challenging. Got my first trail magic from a fellow thru-hiker. He gave me an apple at breakfast. Because you can't throw anything away out here and I didn't want to carry the core in my trash bag, I ate the whole thing except the stem. To be honest, I'm not sure why that's not normal, it tasted fine. It really is these little things that make this experience so different from everyday life. Because they certainly add up to a major departure from the sorts of things we become accustomed to.
Another hiker (headed south) gave a hot tip about a little side trail leading to a waterfall view just north of the shelter. It was a pretty little detour, I was very grateful for the advice. I didn't ever ask the man his name.
The Gooch Mountain Shelter is packed to capacity with twice as many tents set as it is meant to accommodate. They warn us about overcrowding, but I don't really know what we are supposed to do about it. One thing is for sure, I think I'd like to push a little harder than originally planned just to get out of the bubble. In the coming weeks, traffic through here will likely double.
I'm looking forward to taking a ""zero [mile day]"" but it's looking like I should definitely keep putting miles between me and Springer. At least for a few more days.
First night I was able to sleep in the wooden shelter, but tonight I'm in my tent. Certainly I will prefer the tent to a packed shelter, but I am concerned about how wet things might get. It is just now starting to rain. Hope it turns out okay.....","Stover Creek Shelter

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627076,"Rules about food storage forced me to choose between small miles and big miles. I knock out miles pretty quickly early in the day, so I opted for the big miles when I arrived at the decision point around 11am.My decision took me up and over Blood Mountain.... Aptly named, it was brutal. I don't know if it was the highest climb so far or just the steepest. And it just didn't stop raining the whole day. But in the end I completed a bunch of miles and nearly had a breakdown moment.
I was exhausted, I was soaked, and I was getting cold quickly. Luckily, the guy working at Mountain Crossing offered me a ride into town if I decided to stay in a hotel. And I was so beat down by the day that I did just that. After this day I definitely have a better understanding of why nearly 1/4 people drop out at this point.","
",Neels Gap,"Mar 12, Thu",15.60
Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627077,"The hotel allowed me to: take a hot shower, dry out much of my gear, eat a hot dinner, drink a BIG beer, rearrange my pack a little bit, and make a stop at a grocery store.
Then I had to get a ride back to the trail... So at first I started walking out of town, because I figured the people driving out in the country would be more accepting of hitch hikers than the townies. But before I even got to a good spot to stick out my thumb a very kind ""good ol' boy"" whipped his pick up truck around and offered me a ride. Which I gratefully accepted.
The thing with me hitch hiking is not that I'm necessarily afraid of being picked up by the wrong sort of person, rather that I'm afraid I might be a little bit intimidating to your average Good Samaritan, so I'm just not sure who is going to stop and pick me up. Well Ivan seemed like the type of guy that could handle himself if the situation got sticky, and he probably also had a gun somewhere in that truck, but he was nice as can be... He was just out buying a pack of toilet paper ""before all the crazies cleaned out every store."" And when he dropped me off at Mountain Crossing he got a free 20 oz. Sprite for his trouble.
The hiking day was too easy! I mean there were some definite challenges a couple of strong climbs, but the weather was phenomenal and I even got a couple views out of the deal. I think the highlight of the day may have been finally meeting some hikers that were interested in getting to know new people. 
The first few days pretty much anytime I talked to was either (1) an empty small-talker, only talking sure to being stuck in really close quarters with others, or (2) just trying to hand out all of the advice like they need to prove they are the world's best hiker.
Even though these new people are rather nice I'm not sure that I'll hang around with these 3 for very long, because I might be just a little bit faster than they are, but if it works out that way, I could do way worse.
Day 4 is complete and I still have way too much food. I don't understand what's going on. I don't think I am eating enough, but I feel good, I feel strong. I'm going to try to snack more during the hike and I need to start making breakfast. So far it has been a real struggle to get up and cook, but I think tomorrow morning will be a little chilly and hot coffee and oatmeal with chia seeds might be exactly what I need....... That is if the rain holds off.","Neels Gap

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627078,"I knocked out some good miles, though there was very little to look at the entire day. However the weather was excellent. I don't think it rained at all.For the most part a pretty uneventful day. I definitely blew past Oz, Phoenix and No Worries. I think they were planning on taking a zero in Hiawassee. I may see them again down the road, but at my current pace, I think it's unlikely.
Actually had a campfire tonight and that was pleasant. I got to spend a little time with some fellow hikers. Old Chief is a fucking riot! He loves his grandbabies. He also talked a lot about food.... Delicious food that I won't be able to eat for a few more days!
Shelters just aren't a thing right now. I thought they would be so convenient, but they fill up completely by 2pm... And NO WAY am I ready to stop hiking at 2pm! So I just keep pressing on. I like it though. And evidently with COVID-19 flying around, shelters may just end up being a hot bed for disease. At any rate it's working for me and things are going great.","Poplar Stamp Gap
",Steeltrap Gap,"Mar 14, Sat",15.70
Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627079,"Biggest miles to date. So close to North Carolina it's crazy! It was kind of a long day, and I saw only a few hikers after 12:30p today. I think a large number of people went into Hiawassee, GA. They would have gotten picked up at Dick's Creek Gap, which was about the halfway point of my hike today.
When I got there (early afternoon) there was a bit of trail magic set up. And I got an easy refill on my water and 2 tangerines. I eyeballed the bag of Cheetos, but I was happy to have some fresh food and left it. A little ways down the road, I ran into the young couple I camped with last night... They took 8 cans of PBR from the trail magic spot. They were nice enough to offer me........... one. Emily said ""... even though we hauled 'em all the way up here."" Evidently, not realizing that they took all that was there and didn't give anyone else a chance to haul 'em anywhere.
Even though that entitled attitude BS really did irritate me a little bit. After I cooked dinner, I sat and drank my PBR and sliced off a few chunks of my smoked cheddar. You'd have thought I was eating caviar and drinking fine wine, it certainly felt like that type of luxury.
Mostly everything was just awesome today. The sky cleared up and I could actually see for miles. Although not many good photo opportunities because there was always about 20-30 yds worth of forest in the way. 
Definitely did have some struggles though. Had to shit in a hole on the side of a 5% grade hill. Trying to cut through roots, digging a hole, when you're in a desperate spot, digestively speaking, is not a place I want to be ever again. Sorry to everyone who didn't want to read about that just now, but that's the way it is out here and there just isn't any getting around it. Also I had a hell of a time bear-hanging my food bag tonight. Tried to toss into a tree that already had a cut line from a failed attempt. Not sure why I persisted. I didn't have to cut my line though, because I'm an engineer and I know how to do things! Haha!
Tomorrow I will reach my first big milestone of completing the first state of the Appalachian Trail and the day after will be the second big milestone, crossing the 100 mile point!","Steeltrap Gap

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627080,"Finished Georgia in 5 days 23 hours!! Pretty good time; I'm way ahead of where I thought I'd be by now. Also hit a new high today. Climbed my first mountain with higher than one mile elevation. But alas got the same view up there that I have been getting everywhere else.... Fog.
Today was literally 14 miles of fog. It was still good hiking, but nothing much to look at... Even the trees that I CAN see are mostly bare. So it was just rocks, mud, dead leaves and grey skies. 
I'm meeting more people actually worth talking to. It's much nicer to find people that aren't trying to puff up their chests about knowing the most about outdoorsmanship or being able to hike the most miles. I'm finally finding the people that are out here just to be out here. 
I prefer these people way better, but I just haven't found anyone to hike with. No one so far is able to keep up with my distances. However as I am planning on taking my first ""zero"" on Wednesday I'm eager to see if there is some sort of regrouping that happens and if I will run into anyone I've already passed once I get back on the trail.
People back home have been giving me small bits of COVID-19 mania going on, but because I haven't had very consistent mobile service I am having a hard time piecing it all together. I'm trying to head into town tomorrow, and I don't really know what to expect at this point.","Random Campsite near Rich Cove Gap
",Beech Gap,"Mar 16, Mon",14.40
Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627444,"Tried to get up and out of camp early today, because I needed to hike 16 miles to get to Rock Gap before 3:45p to catch a shuttle into Franklin, NC. The morning started off pretty terribly when I woke up with a puddle in my tent. Luckily my inflatable mattress pad kept me out of the water during the night. It was still raining as I tore down camp, so pretty much everything went into my pack wet.After I began hiking, only about a half mile in, the hand strap to one of my trekking poles just fell out. May not sound like a big deal, but the strap is where all the weight goes, without it the pole is basically just a stick to carry. I spent about 20 minutes trying to fix it in the middle of the trail until I finally gave up and just jury-rigged it with a couple of knots.
The rain persisted for a few hours and I was feeling a little stressed to have the trekking pole delay due to my deadline for the day. As I began to ascend Albert Mountain the sky was clearing up and the sun even peeked out as soon as I got to the top of Albert Tower. The first time I got a real good view of the landscape and it was breathtaking.
Immediately after Albert Tower, I crossed the 100 mile marker (and for some reason a 2nd 100 mile marker 75 yards down the trail). I felt all the stress and worry drift away and began to just really enjoy the hike.
I ended up making it to Rock Gap with 45 minutes to kill, and with the best stroke of luck ran into a bit of trail magic. I was fed 3 corn dogs, 2 blocks of fried cheese, 2 slices of pizza and a Smithwick's beer ( for St. Patrick's Day) all by a family (of 8) whose thru-hike I watched on YouTube last year. Added bonus - they are also from Ohio!","Beech Gap

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627445,"I took the day off, after hiking 115 miles in 8 days, to give myself a little recovery time. I got a hot shower, a couple hot meals, plenty of beer and my laundry done. My timing was pretty shitty because I took this rest day the day after NC closed all restaurants for everything other than takeout.
The place was clean, the bed was more comfortable than the ground, and my body definitely got plenty of rest. However, my mind did not. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) is now suggesting that all hikers postpone or cancel their thru hikes due to precautions over spreading COVID-19. They aren't forcing anyone off of the trail, but there is a real decision to be made here. I think it still makes sense for me to continue to hike. There is no information on how hiking will pose any greater a danger than attempting to return home.","

I saw a few familiar faces also having some breakfast. No Worries, Phoenix, and Bilbo have all decided to end their hikes. Rhett and Emily are going to continue on, but they are taking 2 days off because Rhett is having knee pain.
The hike today was pretty quiet, but the weather was phenomenal. I summited Siler Bald to some extraordinary views and three annoying college aged girls gossiping about their professors. Just before I got to Wayah Bald, more trail magic! I had a cold can of Coca-Cola and more awesome views atop The Wayah Bald tower.

The hike was kinda brutal today. Shorter miles than I'm used to at this point, but the descents were extra challenging. Steep, slick, rooty and rocky. My feet took some abuse today. There was one amazing sight called ""The Jump-off"" so-called for obvious reasons. The trail makes a hairpin turn and if you miss it, you would go barreling down a sheer cliff face.
Tomorrow I'll be passing the Nantahala Outdoor Center, which under normal circumstances would be a big deal to thru hikers. However, due to the current situation, everything is shut down except the General Store. Still looking forward to a little fresh food in the morning though.

It was really nice day but there was so much climbing. SO. MUCH. CLIMBING!
Got a little Trail Magic before the steepest climb of the day.

He had actually picked up his car from the nearby B&B where he stashed it, and had come to the dam to pass out a little Trail magic on his zero day. Hammer was hanging back, because he made friends with the proprietors' dogs.
Nails convinced me to go stay at the B&B to get a hot shower, some hot meals, and laundry cleaned. Honestly, the thing that sold me was having clean dry clothes again. Although all that other stuff was great too.

By the time we had hiked 16 miles and 4000 ft up in the rain, everyone was freezing!
It's kinda crummy when all you want to do is change out of wet and into dry clothes, but you have all the camp things to do first. So you just have to suck it up for a while.

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627453,"Yesterday was awful, being cold and wet all day, but today was a real struggle for me. Firstly, I stayed in camp late to wait for the rain to stop, because I was just tired of being wet. Getting a late start to the day is a little demotivating, because on the trail you sort of get a feel for how many miles you're going to end up hiking by how many hours are left in the hiking day. I personally like to stop hiking between 4 and 5 pm.The reason today was so so difficult was that the trail was just all mud from the previous day's rainfall and it felt like every mile I would climb up about 300 ft and immediately drop back down 280 ft. Neither climbs or descents are ANY amount of fun in mud.
Luckily the rain held off and the sun came out for a good portion of the day. However, I dressed in the morning for the cool temps and by 2pm was overheating crazily. It got so warm, that I couldn't take it any more. I stopped right in the middle of the trail, I took my pack off, I took my pants off, I took my thermal leggings off and changed into regular underwear.

Clingman's Dome is the highest elevation point of the entire Appalachian Trail, and there is an observation tower which takes you up about 50 or so extra feet. This was my first attempt at hiking by headlamp, and it was not as difficult as I expected it to be.The sunrise was beautiful as you might expect. It was a very clear morning and we could see all the surrounding mountains for miles and miles. However, to be honest, it really wasn't as grand a sight as I had anticipated. The other people seemed to be way more impressed than I was.
Today was notable on multiple occasions though. 1) highest elevation [as previously stated] 2) crossed the 200 mile marker 3) hiked my most miles to date at 22 miles and most importantly, 4) today I finally got my trail name!
I am Two-Can, because whenever I have the chance, I pack out 2 cans of beer. A 12oz. can of beer weighs approximately 3/4 lbs. so most hikers aren't willing to lug them around. What makes my ritual extra unique is that I don't just carry my 2 cans to the next camp, but I only drink one per night, so I will actually carry one of those full beer cans for 2 whole days.Everytime I pull one out of my pack people say ""You carried that all the way up here!?"" and my response is almost always ""Worth the weight...""

I saw a man dressed like Abraham Lincoln. I assume he dresses that way because he kind of looks like Abraham Lincoln, except for the fact that he is about 5'7”. I didn't stop to get the story, because I was cruising along and listening to music. I found out later through the hiker grapevine that he was lecturing a young hiker about something or another, so I was glad I didn't investigate further. The whole scene was a little surreal, though.

Brownies, chips, mini-Oreos, some sort of marshmallow Little Debbie cakes. I probably should eat some vegetables or something, but I'm having a hard time not gorging on sugary thingies.

It's pretty ironic to me that people who have homes very nearby feel like it's cool to just go out for a hike, when it feels like the entire hiking community has it out for we thru-hikers who are pressing on despite the precautions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

Had a weird dream about leprechauns and a school for magic (Hogwarts-esque) made specially for troubled inner city youths. Don't think that's all that important, but it stands out.
Hit the trail and immediately came across a random grave site for two people named George and Eva Gragg. A quick Google search about this odd little site only brings up others asking questions about why they are there. Interestingly I was the only one who camped there last night who saw it this morning.
I continued on as the Smoky Mountain Diner in Hot Springs seemed to be calling to me. I don't usually listen to music in the mornings on my hikes, I generally wait until the afternoon when I feel like I need the extra push, but today I decided to listen early. I chose an album that I hadn't heard in maybe 3 or 4 years, and it had me literally dancing and skipping down the trail. In my head, I had ALL the moves, but I suspect if anyone else would have seen me I would have looked rather spastic. Not for nothing, though, because I did put down the 3.2-mile descent into Hot Springs in about 54 minutes. 
Due to COVID-19 Stay At Home orders, there really wasn't anything going on in town. I stopped in the Hillbilly Market picked up a few beers, an apple, and a chocolate milk. Chugged the milk, ate the apple, saving the beers for dinner. I putzed around town for just a little bit waiting for the diner to open at 11 am. Once it did, my lunch comprised of a BBQ Bacon Burger (all the way), an apple cobbler (homemade), a personal pizza (mushroom and banana peppers) and a side salad.

Today's hike was normal for the first 5 hours. And then BAM! everything was covered in ice. And it wasn't normal ice either; it must have formed after rain in the wind. There was a strange 2 inch tooth-like icicle sticking off the side of every little twig and tree branch. Really cool looking stuff, but it hurt a little bit when it fell off the tree and hit me in the face.
After passing through the ice forest, the trail just hopped up into this really rocky ridge. I could see all the way down the mountain that I was atop into the valley. The view was quite nice except that I was really cold, and the sun was shining down there making everything look so very warm. I guess you don't get to do something epic like a 2200 mile hike without a little sacrifice.
Also crossed the 300 mile mark today. These ""hundreds"" are often only marked out by someone forming the number out of sticks or rocks. They aren't marked permanently because they move slightly here and there each year as the trail takes on a minutely different shape. I almost missed this one, because it was covered in snow, but it stood out just enough to catch my eye.","Unnamed Campsite

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627639,"The day started out so very cold. My hands were having a hard time gripping things, my feet were wet, there was still snow on the ground. It was definitely a challenge.
As the trail descended down into lower elevations and the sun came out, things warmed up, and the hiking got easier.
This evening I faced a very big decision. I have been considering getting off the trail for a few weeks, to try to wait out the pandemic. The many shutdowns and statewide bans are becoming increasingly worrisome. I don't know how difficult it will be too make progress. I truly believe I am at a much lower risk of catching the virus by continuing to hike, and it is pretty easy to keep distance away from people out here. So I have decided to press on, but I am not ruling out a hiatus at some point. It may just come to that.
The internet hiking community has convinced itself that hikers who continue during this time will cause harm to small trail towns by spreading the virus to them. I'm not convinced that they have any ground to stand on, because in my estimation the virus is being spread on highways and airplanes, at least in most part. Hikers move at about 2-3 mph, even if some people on trail are carrying the virus, it must be spreading more quickly than they can walk it from town to town. Furthermore, if one is at lower risk of CATCHING the virus, by necessity they are at even lower risk of SPREADING the virus.
These are just my thoughts on the matter, I could be completely mistaken, but if I believed that I was a potential harm to others, I would stop.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636565,"Getting ready to head into Erwin, TN tomorrow. I will be booking a hotel room there and I am ecstatic about the prospect of having a shower all to myself. Of course, increased food options and laundered clothing are very exciting also, but the shower I am looking forward to the most. 
I keep thinking as I write these daily logs up that I would like to introduce more humor and profundity in them. I think that would more closely represent me, and I certainly have been thinking about things on trail more than just food and showers. However, at the end of the day after setting up my tent and bedding and cooking Ramen or instant potatoes, and getting all the other chores done like hanging bear bags, fetching and filtering water, and organizing everything so that it can all be packed up in a sensible way the next day, all of those thoughts I have had throughout the day seem to escape my conscious brain. Then the very next day once I'm out on the trail walking, they come right back.","Low Gap Campsite

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636566,"A short day of hiking, for sure. I'm spending the night in a hotel tonight. There's something a little bittersweet about it. It's nice to have some comfort with a bed and a shower. I turned on the television, and it actually felt a little surreal. I didn't leave it on long, but I did catch the last 25 minutes of Beavis and Butt-Head Do America. I laughed at the churlish humor confirming that deep down I'm still 13 years old. 
Certainly, I will gladly accept the comforts this place has to offer, but it doesn't take very long being away from the trail before I want to go back. There's no difference in solitude between a hotel room and sleeping at a campsite by myself, but somehow there is an incredible difference in loneliness, a greater feeling of isolation when surrounded by walls and a locked door. 
On the other hand, there's so much less work to do! So, I'm still not complaining.","Temple Hill Gap Campsite

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636567,"Said farewell to some friends today. They are taking a zero day in Erwin, but I want to hike on. I'm well stocked from resupply and eager to get a few more miles today. There is a chance they could catch up to me at some point, but it's not likely. 
I've set up camp near a place called ""Beauty Spot"" and I've come up to the top of the bald to watch the sunset. There are quite a few local people up here sitting around staring off to the west. The scene reminds me somewhat of a 4th of July fireworks viewing. It's ironic that we've all come to this spot, not to see a once in a year event, but a literal everyday event. The spectacle doesn't seem ordinary at all, and for me, as I'm just passing through, it is a rare moment.
I'm glad to have these rare moments, but as I consider those around me who could potentially come up here every clear day and watch a beautiful sunset, I realize that we can put more time into finding and appreciating the ""Beauty Spot"" in our everyday life.... Yea, it's a pretty cheesy and basic sentiment and it's not an insight all that difficult to come across. However, it's a salient personal moment, so why not publish it on the internet?","Erwin, TN

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636568,"Today presented me with a really nice morning. Even after a cup of coffee and some breakfast, I still got a pretty early start. Today, I've started a new plan of stopping midday to take a lunch break. In Erwin, I had the first opportunity to see myself in a mirror in a while, and I have lost more weight than I am comfortable with at this point. As a result I am making sure to eat a little more than I have been. 
The hike was neither exceptionally challenging nor notably easy. There were a couple of nice views but nothing earth-shaking. As I wrap up week 4, I am beginning to feel like this is just my normal life now. I'm still enjoying all the experience has to offer, but I'm maybe a little bit numbed to the whole situation. It's not upsetting in any way, I guess I'm just settling in.","Beauty Spot

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636569,"Today was an interesting one. Started off in long pants and a t-shirt. Then it started getting warm, so I changed to shorts. Then it started to rain so I put my rain jacket on. Then the sun came out so I took my rain jacket off. Then out of nearly nowhere, a thunderstorm strikes. So I start hustling down the mountain in shorts and a t-shirt, soaking wet, hail pelting me in the face. Very shortly I was able to find shelter, and it was lunch time anyway. So I put some warmer clothes on and had some lunch. Then I ate a little more... The rain stopped, but I was still hungry, so I ate a little more. And then I decided I was done hiking for the day, so I set myself up, and took a nap. I woke up, and made some dinner, and now I'm back to bed. 
It turns out I was pretty tired and hungry, so despite only hiking for 7 miles and having a rather miserable hour, it still has been a damn good day. Just doing what my body is asking me for, and not being beholden to miles or a schedule or any of those things. It has been a wonderful reminder of where my head should be while out here.","Ash Gap Campsite

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636570,"Pretty damn good hiking today. I stopped in at a little place called The Station at 19E around midday. I had a hot dog (which was ginormous) and fries, along with fried mozzarella sticks (quality living right there!) and some chicken wings (honestly, they were just okay). I also drank a beer with my lunch and grabbed 2 more to pack out with me. I listened to a guy from Brooklyn talk about his life in ""the nay buh-hood."" It was slightly amusing. Then I hiked on. 
Took a side trail over to a waterfall. It was quite a cool site. Best waterfalls I have seen on the trail so far. It was well worth the extra quarter mile walk (round trip). If it was a little warmer out, I would have considered taking a little natural shower, but today I would have frozen my man-bits off. 
I crossed the 400 mile marker, and did just a tiny little happy dance. I arrived at the shelter a little bit later than I had hoped, but plenty of time to get things done before sunset. Good timing, too, because as soon as the sun went down a big thunderstorm rolled in. Sleeping on the THIRD! floor of this shelter. Plenty of space here for social distancing.","Stan Murray Shelter

Getting around the river here was interesting; the trail skirts around a little cliff face where the maintainers have actually added concrete so there is enough space to have good footing. 
I'll be heading in to Hampton, TN tomorrow for some grocery shopping. But first thing, I am going to Dunkin Donuts!! I haven't had a fresh donut in weeks. These little luxuries really make roughing it just a little bit easier.","Mountaineer Shelter

Dunkin Donuts was almost what I hoped it would be. The coffee was good and hot (thankfully, because it was a cold morning), the donuts were fresh and the sugar shock was an interesting sensation. The only problem was I had to eat and drink in a gas station parking lot, since there is obviously no indoor seating. 
Tomorrow I have a cabin reserved at a campground. Which means a hot shower, a warm bed and laundry!","Laurel Fork Shelter

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636575,"I arrived at the cabin around 2pm. Not an excessively cold day, but there is a big campfire here and it's pretty doggone cozy just sitting next to it. I'm the only hiker here which isn't at all surprising, since we are so close to Damascus. 
I have been tempted by the prospect of having McDonald's delivered straight to my door. It's not a pretty picture to see a hungry hiker inhale 8 McDonald's sandwiches in about 25 minutes. It is, however, a delight to my taste buds. We shall see if my innards are nearly as pleased later on today. 
Oh, and just in case anyone was wondering... the cost to have 8 McDonald's sandwiches (and a smoothie, because: healthy, right?) to a cabin at a campground in the Middle of Nowhere, TN is kiiiiiinda expensive. The whole order with tax and tip for the delivery was about $10 more than the cabin rental. Still sooo worth it.","Vandeventer Shelter

In other news, Damascus, VA. Dubbed ""Trail Town, USA."" Well, not this year. Due to closures and coronavirus precautions, this is just another sleepy little town with nothing much going on. I did make a stop into Subway for lunch (and a sandwich to carry out for dinner). I've rarely gotten tomatoes on sandwiches before, because I'm not a huge fan. But dammit if it isn't nice to just have some fresh food right now, so I got the fuckin' tomatoes. 
Thirdly, the waters in this area are absolutely insane right now. The river in Damascus has risen 3 feet in just a few days. The water is RUSHING and GUSHING all over the place. What I presume is normally a 6"" deep trickle crossing the trail was a river that went up to my knees. The current was pulling pretty strongly, and it took a good amount of effort not to get dragged downstream. 
This stream crossing is where I finally caught up to this guy named Lefty. He is an awesome guy, and a real inspiration, but this one's getting long so more about him tomorrow.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

Two-Can,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636578,"Today's hike was mostly standard: rocks, roots, kinda cold, kinda wet. I've entered into the Grayson Highlands where there is a contingent of wild ponies that roam the hills. The ponies are kinda cool, they don't mind people at all. You can tell that people feed them often enough, because they come looking for handouts as soon as you start preparing food. 
As promised, I would like to talk about Lefty for just a minute... Lefty was injured in an industrial accident 21 years ago. He was marred by an arc flash blast as an apprentice electrician (which just kinda hits home a little for me). Lefty lost his right arm (hence the name) and 2 fingers on his left hand. His right leg was also irreparably damaged. This is a pretty humbling tale in and of itself, but this guy is out here thru-hiking and KILLING IT! It's seriously not easy trying to navigate this trail with 4 limbs, so just to start with hiking on a bum leg with only one arm is heroic enough in my book. But then you have to realize all the other shit this guy does with only 2 fingers and a thumb. Cooking, starting fires, setting up a tent, etc. 
I don't think he would be super pleased with this little expose on his hiking life, but we just won't tell him about it. Anyway, this guy is my hero right now. He hikes as fast as I do (and not many people out here do), and also he just finished his bachelor's degree in March at the age of 48.","Saunders Shelter
