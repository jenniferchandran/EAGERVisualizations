Squad 51,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480262,"Well yes my hike is set to start in over 5 years. I have been reading this site for so long I couldn't wait to become a part of it. I want to publicly thank Dennis Blanchard for his book ""300 Zeros"". This was the first book I read about a hike on the AT. It combines my hobby of ham radio with my desire to hike the AT. I know it will be hard for anyone to follow this journal and I will post very sporadically between now and my hike but I just wanted to get started. I have a campaign on Indeegogo trying to raise funds for this hike. The money is whats going to take so long. Unlike alot of people I read about on here I don't have a great paying job or good vacation time. So I set my goal for 5 years out. Thus ends my first entry. God Bless",,The beginning of the beginning,"Jan 17, Sat",0

Squad 51,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480278,I am a gaget junky and plan to have a few electronics on the trail with me. I am a ham radio operator and plan to opperate from the trail.

Squad 51,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480527,Well its another week closer to my planned hike which is still 5 years away. I am reading as much as I can right now about gear and the trail knowing it will all chance over the next 5 years. Right now I am just in the saving money stage. I should also be working at getting in better shape. I watch all these youtube videos over in shape hikers huffing and puffing and I am 40 pounds overweight. I have alot of work to do. If you are following me thank you.,,Another Week,"Jan 24, Sat",0
Squad 51,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480806,Well it has been another long week at work. I get Backpacker magazine so I am reading and re-reading that like crazy. Five years seems so far off but when it comes to being ready and geared up it really isn't that long. As I have mentioned I don't make alot of money so saving for this gear and for the trip itself is quite a task. I want to meet this challenge head on and finally feel like I can accomplish something I set out to do. If you are following this thank you and please say hi.,,One more week gone by,"Jan 31, Sat",0
Squad 51,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481548,With my experience as a medic I am wondering just how much to bring as far as med stuff. I can help someone that may be hurt but the chances of that are slim. I always like to err on the side of caution but I also have to think about pack weight. Any thoughts would be helpful. Hike is still along way off but still very excited.,,thinking,"Feb 14, Sat",0
Squad 51,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/496288,Well have been preparing slowly. Have also been enjoying my other hobbies which are storm chasing and amateur radio. There is so much to consider as a first time long distance hiker who is still out of shape. I envy those who are on the trail right now..,,Been a while,"May 23, Sat",0
Squad 51,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508114,I haven't written in a while. Im still just reading everything I can and looking at gear. Im finally getting some money together to start to purchase gear but it takes forever when you only make 10 an hour.,,still reading,"Aug 01, Sat",0
