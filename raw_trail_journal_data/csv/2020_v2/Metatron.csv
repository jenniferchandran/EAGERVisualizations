Metatron,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625919,"The State of Nevada District Court has given me permission to walk the Appalachian Trail.  After the court disapproved the postponement online, I called and found a human who agreed to postpone jury duty, but only until September 15th.  It's kind of like being on parole.  If you see someone climbing Blood Mountain while wearing an electronic ankle bracelet, that would be me.  There's nothing like a little court-approved recreation to stir the mind and body.Now I can pack...",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Thu",0
Metatron,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625930,"The State of Nevada and Southwest Airlines have jointly agreed to allow me to fly to Atlanta to start my hike on February 22nd.  My son and one of the grandsons have offered to walk the first mile or so with me on the approach trail out of Amicalola Falls - the same path he and I took on several long Thanksgiving weekends years ago.  It's early in the season to start a thru-hike.  I'm hoping for good weather in Georgia and through the Smokies.  Even starting later, cold weather can persist until hikers are well north of Damascus.  It is a challenge to pack the right clothing and gear without carrying too much weight.Thanks to all who are keeping up with my adventure.  I believe there is a guest book you can sign on this trailjournals.com page.",,View Entry,"Jan 24, Fri",0

Metatron,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626063,"My first resupply boxes were entrusted to the US Postal Service this morning.  That gets me through the Smokey Mountain National Park, at least in the planning stage.  Mail resupply  boxes range from three-days' supplies to full seven-day grubstakes.  I've packed them all, fitting them into either the medium (tiny) or large (small) flat-rate boxes the USPS ships for $15.05 and $21.10 each, respectively.  Some locations require Fedex or UPS, and have only the road crossing as their address.  That's adventure.
I planned to use no-cook food, but found it resulted in greater weight and volume.  I'm compromising, using food that can be eaten without boiling water, even if it won't be as palatable, such as dried potatoes, instant rice, ramen, and dried vegetables.  I'll carry an alcohol stove with a smaller amount of fuel, relying on less stove cooking.  Cold soaking will reduce cooking times, or produce something edible when there is no other food preparation choice.  Warm food is a real treat on the trail, even if it's ramen or dried potatoes.

Metatron,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626246,"Neither the Mountain Laurel Designs Exodus pack nor the MLD bivy sack will be delivered before I leave in three days.  I ordered them on January 13th, but maybe should have allowed more lead time.  I'm using a GVP Gear G4 backpack, just like the one I took to Katahdin in 2005.  Everything totals 11 pounds in the pack, not including food, water, and fuel.  That's not counting clothes I'm wearing, trekking poles, etc.  I'm packing food that tastes better cooked, but can be eaten cold-soaked or just plain cold.  It will save weight and give me a little more flexibility.  Eat to live, or live to eat?I won't bore you with a gear list, but basically, I'll be using a light frameless pack, a dyneema fiber tarp, and a 20-degree down bag - the basic ultralight setup.  With the amount of shade on the trail, I'm leaving my SolarMonkey at home, and using a 10,000 mAh backup battery for phone, mp3 player, and headlamp recharge.  You don't need a map on the AT, but I do recommend Guthook's navigation app.  It has a lot of information, crowd-based and otherwise, with downloadable maps.  I used The Guthook app for the PCT.Thanks for keeping up with my walk.  Best of luck in your adventures, wherever they are.",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Sun",0
