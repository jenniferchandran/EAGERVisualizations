Lightbulb,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/494999,"May 13th The wind blew all night and sounded like a wind tunnel blowing 30-40 mph and it cold on top of that. I put on my wool cap, then long pants, then wool socks, then long sleeve shirt before I was warm enough to sleep. The wind chill this morning was almost to much to bear. It finally got bearable once I got in the woods with a wind break. I got to Thomas Knob shelter for lunch after a long climb over rocks and roots and some more rocks (they really hurt my feet). Then I got the Grayson Highlands and got to see the wild ponies, one of the highlights of my hike so far. They let me pet them, but the young ones are still pretty shy. Then more rocks and roots for the rest of the day. There were some nice views from there once you were on the Bald. Got to Wise shelter around 620 pm and set my tent and was getting ready for dinner and Moma Moab and Utah showed up and soon after Queen B and BB came into camp. While we eating some wild ponies came right thru like it was no big deal and it was pretty cool. I hiked about 12 miles today even with my blisters still hurting but they seem to be getting a little better. Passed the 500 mile mark today.

More rocks and roots and it really is hurting my feet, so when I found a stream big enough I soaked my feet in the cold water until they were numb. Stopped in Old Orchard shelter for lunch and moved on. Had a long day of hiking and got the road to Troutdale but couldn't get ride to the Hostel and it was dark. I pitched my tent right next to the road. I need a few supplies to get me to Marion so I'll try a catch a ride in the morning to Sugar Grove.

Hiked a little over 13 miles today. The shelter had a shower but it ice cold water, I washed off best I could without getting to cold, because I was one stinky hiker.

Then as I was hiking, I hear this deep, loud growl from the woods just over a berm about 15 feet away, there was a bear on the other side that I had heard. The hair on the back of neck stood up and I froze, then I backed away nice and easy then hiked fast keeping an eye behind me. Stopped at Jenny Knob shelter for some lunch and the weather was clearing up and the wind was blowing pretty good, so I got rained on from the leaves when the trees moved. Went to Trent grocery to get a cheeseburger and fries, worth the mile walk out of the way. Got to Dismal Falls about 715 pm to set camp but not many spots, a lot of hikers here tonight.
