LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628175,"After hiking over 600 miles of the AT over the past 3+ years
I was really looking forward to resuming my journey early Spring. Then the
COVID-19 plague came and postpone my plans to mid-Spring.
After getting approval for a two-week vacation from work I
started detailed planning around May 1. I used a gear checklist from prior
Spring hikes, so I was pretty sure I had everything. I selected southern PA
because of its easy terrain, often speculated as the easiest stretch along the
AT. It would be a good hike for me because I was a bit out of shape and about
5-10 lbs. heavier than normal due to the plague.
Since I am getting further away from CT, I need to spend
more than a week on the trail, or I will go broke with all the transportation
costs. Hence, I packed enough hiking food for 12 days and extra clothing in my
car to avoid having to do laundry mid-way.
I downloaded the PA section of the AT from the Guthooks
Guides application so I would have detailed hike information along the way.
This wonderful app works with GPS and is very reliable. It tells you where the
shelters, camp sites, hostels, hotels, and water sources are. Hikers often
leave comments at these locations to tell you more about the location than is
posted in the app.
I found an AT Shuttle Driver that was willing to shuttle me
from Duncannon to the MD/PA state line, also known as the Mason-Dixon line. The
cost quoted was $100, which seemed fair for his 3+ hour round trip drive. I usually
start my section hikes on Saturdays but held back a day due to snow squalls and
sub-zero wind-chill temps on Saturday.
I was planning on making it to Duncannon in 5 days and
thought that would be a good half-way point. I could drive home if I was not
feeling well or the weather turned for the worst.
I cut out some of my luxury items to make my pack as light
as possible. I got the base weight down to 24 lbs. Adding 2.5 lbs for water and
7.5 lbs for food, it tipped the scales at 34 lbs.

Day 0 – Drive to Harrisburg
I drove from my home in central CT to a hotel in Harrisburg Saturday afternoon and
stayed for the night. I was close to the meeting spot in Duncannon and was
nice. There was only a hand full of guests staying there. I wore my facemask
anyway to avoid getting sick.",,View Entry,"May 01, Fri",0

Weather: Cloudy, windy, temps in the 50’s
I got up early, had a light breakfast and drove 20 minutes
to the meeting spot in Duncannon. Mike, the Driver, was on-time and had a large
SUV. He drove me to Pen Mar park, just south of the MD/PA state. With 5 days of
food in my pack and a late start I opted for a shorter than normal mile day. 
Highlights included passing by Deer Lick Shelters, Antietam
Shelter and Old Forge picnic grounds.
The weather was still cold and windy. I felt some sleet
along the way. There were a few hills in the first few miles, but the rest was
relatively flat. I stayed warm as long as I kept hiking. I arrive at the two Tumbling
Run shelters around 3:00 PM. It was near a town park and there were a lot of
day hikers passing by. 
The sign on the shelter said it was closed, so I setup my
sleeping pad under the pavilion between the shelters. Late afternoon two thru
hikers stopped at one of the shelters to stay the night. They were just
resuming their thru hike after taking 6 weeks off due to the plague. They were
heading south-bound (SB) and were nice to talk to.
The nighttime temps got down to 40 degrees and the high
winds had subsided. I mistakenly brought my summer sleeping bag, which was only
good to 50 degrees. I slept with my down puffy and wool socks and kept warm all
night.","Pen Mar Town Park

Weather: Partly sunny, light wind, temps in the low 60’s
I woke up early, had breakfast, packed my pack, and got on
the trail around 8:00 AM. 
Highlights included passing by Chimney Rocks, Rt. 233, Rocky
Mountain Shelters and Rt. 30.
My warm-up hikes were 8 miles at most with light packs.
Hence, this seemed like 15 miles. I recall getting to the shelter late
afternoon, completely exhausted. Fortunately, the winds died down making it a
delightful evening to have dinner and say hi to a few day hikers passing by. 
The Quarry Gap Shelters were spaced about 20’ apart, with a
covered picnic table between them. The spring was just 20 yards away and the
bathroom was no further than 50 yards. The bear box was just 30 yards away. The
camp was kept in immaculate condition by Jim Stauch, the “Innkeeper.” Jim did
not stop by to visit, so I will have to send him a think you card for keeping
two shelters and surrounding area nice and clean.
Around 6:00 PM, two hikers came to the shelters. One was on
a 2-day hike and stayed overnight on a tent platform. The other was a
thru-hiker who started hiking the AT at the southern terminus in Georgia in
February. Unlike most thru hikers, he never got off the trail and was happy to
be close the halfway point. The thru hiker looked in excellent shape and must
have had a body-mass index around 20.
I had the second shelter to myself and opted to sleep there
for the night. It was very cold, and temps dipped into the 30’s. A good think I
had my down puffy on to keep me warm!","Tumbling Run Shelter

Weather: Mostly cloudy, light wind, temps in the upper 50’s
I woke up early, had breakfast, packed my pack, and got on
the trail around 8:00 AM. 
Highlights included passing by the Birch Run shelter, James
Fry Shelters and Pine Grove Furnace State Park. I was planning on hiking just
12.2 miles (to the second shelter). However, the Guthooks app reported that the
hostel at the entrance of the park was open, so I opted to hike closer to 17
miles. If I could hike 18 miles the next day it would put me into Boiling
Springs a day early. 
Unfortunately, the hostel was closed with a sign on the door
and no phone numbers to call. This was somewhat depressing as I called the main number the night before. The answering machine indicated they were open with check-in time at 5:00 PM. I waited there until 5:00 PM and nobody answered the door. Lesson learned, don't trust an answering machine!
I then opted to hike 1.8 miles further to a
Spring just outside of the park. It was a small campsite and I stayed there
alone. The spring was flowing well, and I filtered the water anyway, like I
always do.
I recall getting into the campsite around 6:00 PM, having
dinner and retiring before dark. This was the second longest day I had hiked in
my 3+ years of section hiking. I was starting to show my age (58).","Quarry Gap Shelters

I woke up early, had breakfast, packed my pack, and got on
the trail around 8:00 AM. 
Highlights included passing by Tagg Run Shelter, Rt. 34, Rt.
94, and the Alec Kennedy Shelter.
This was my second day hiking long distance. I was worried
that my knees might get sore and possibly give out on me. Frequent rest stops
kept me going. I knew I would be in Boiling Springs by day’s end, where I could
get indoor shelter, good rest, and a shower at Lisa’s Hostel. 
By the time I got to the hostel I could barely walk. The
blisters on the soles of my feet felt like hot poking irons burning deeper with
each step. Perhaps next time I will find some insoles that will prevent that
from happening. 
I texted Lisa when I got near the town park. She met me 10
minutes later and drove me to her home and hostel just 2 miles from there. The house
was a large house that was well kept. She had 2 horses out back, some chickens,
roosters, ducks, dogs and cats. The hostel was a shed that she converted to a
hostel a few years earlier. It had 5 bunks, microwave and drinking water. This
was minimal accommodations, but what do you expect for $20 a night? There was
no AC, heat, nor a floor fan. Fortunately, it did not drop below 55 degrees
overnight.
Being just 24 miles away from Duncannon, I thought about
slack-packing the entire distance in one day. I would be able to complete the
section with a small and light 8 lb. daypack and save 1 day on the trip. Only a
good night’s rest and some confidence would determine if I would go thru with
it.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

Weather: Mostly cloudy, light wind, temps in the upper 60’s
I woke up early, had breakfast, packed my day pack, and got
on the trail around 8:00 AM. Slack-Packing is when you get a ride to or from your destination on a given day so you can hike that section with a light day bag vs a full backpack. It allows for more miles with less ware on the body. My car was already at my destination so I was all set. 
Highlights included passing thru several farms in the Cumberland
Valley, Amish people on the trail, Rt. 174, ATC’s Scott Farm Trail Work Center,
Rt. 944, Darlington Shelter, Rt. 850, Cover Mountain Shelter, and Hawk Rock. The
first 12 miles were relatively flat. The next 7 miles were up and down ridges.
The next 4 miles were along a rocky trail ridge that threatened to sprain my ankles
with every step. The last mile was as steep decent from Hawk Rock, dropping
nearly 1,000’ into Duncannon. Ouch! 
The view from Hawk Rock was amazing. There were about 2
dozen day hikers that had hiked up from the valley just to see the view early
evening. I recall getting to my car in the parking lot around 7:45PM. I drove
into town, found a parking spot outside the “Kind of Outdoorsy” hostel, and
stayed the night. 
The hostel consisted of a bunk room with 3 double bunks, two
lounge chairs and a small table to prepare meals on. There were no windows and
I envisioned that this must be what life in prison is like. The second room was
mainly used for storage and passage to a small bathroom, which had a nice
shower, since and toilet. I was pleasantly surprised that the Town had not
closed the shelter years earlier. For $25 a night, including a shower, what do
you expect?
Two thru hikers arrived late afternoon
and ordered pizza for dinner from the pizzeria across the street. Fortunately,
they left me several slices of pizza. I ate the pizza, took a shower, took some
pain meds, and went right to sleep. This was my longest slack-pack day ever on
the AT, eclipsed only by the time I hiked 25 miles with a full pack.","Lisa's Hostel in Boiling Springs

I woke up late in Duncannon, went across the street to an
outdoor diner, where I ordered eggs, toast, bacon, and hash browns. I then
packed up my gear and drove 35 miles south back to Lisa’s hostel in Boiling
Springs. She was expecting me, and I was the only person staying that
day/night. Yay!
Highlights included returning to Lisa’s hostel, relaxation,
recharging electronics and watching the chickens, roosters and ducks fight with
each other and enjoying 3 light beers for just $2.00 each. I called Mike the
Shuttle driver and scheduled a ride from Port Clinton (approx. 80 miles north),
back to Duncannon the following morning. He quoted me the same as before, $110,
which seemed fair.
I went to bed early because I knew the overnight trail would
come roaring thru around 2:00 AM and a rooster would start roosting at 4:00 AM.
The train was so loud it sounded like the Polar Express coming thru the back
yard! The ground and bunks shook for the 5+ minutes it took for the train to pass
by. Now I know what its like to sleep in an earthquake zone.","Kind of Outdoorsy Hostel in Duncannon

Weather: Mostly sunny, light wind, temps in the upper 60’s
I woke up early, had breakfast, packed my pack, drove about
80 miles north to Port Clinton, dropped my car, got shuttled back to Duncannon,
and got on the trail around 10:15 AM. I had a full pack with a 5-day supply of
food and 2 liters to last the day. It was Saturday and I passed many day hikers
along the way.
Highlights included crossing the Susquehanna river on the
Clarks Ferry bridge, watching a diesel trail pass by with 130 box cars
attached, passing Clarks Ferry Shelter, Rt. 225 and catching a view at table
rock. Even though it was a sub-10-mile day, it seemed closer to 20 miles
carrying a full pack mostly up.
I arrive at Peter’s Mountain Shelter around 5:00 PM and felt
exhausted. It was a large 2 story shelter that slept 20 people max. In fear of
catching the COVID-19 virus, I stayed a safe distance away. There were about a
dozen hikers staying there. Half were on a 2-day hike. The rest were thru
hiking north bound all the way to Mt. Katahdin, the norther terminus of the AT
in central Main!
The worst think about this site was the hike to the nearest
spring. It was nearly 400 steps down a steep hill with lots of stairs cut into
the rock. I had to take several breaks on the return trip. At least the spring
was flowing well. The water was clean and refreshing. I filtered it before
drinking, like I always do.
There was no rain in the forecast, so I used my tarp as a
ground cloth and cowboy camped under the stars. It was beautiful watching the
starts at night. I wished that my 6 year young Grandson, Bryson, could be
there with me.","Lisa's Hostel in Boiling Springs

I woke up early, had breakfast, packed my pack, and got on
the trail around 8:00 AM. 
Highlights included passing Kinter View, tent sites,
springs, country roads, and Yellow Springs Campsite.
The trail was nearly flat with a few ups and down along the way.
Thank God for that!
The hike was long and challenging. I figured I would be in
good shape to complete the hike around noon of day 11 if I could hike 15-18
miles per day for a tough 3 day stretch. I took lots of breaks along the way,
some with the thru hikers. I got to know a few of their stories and how they
managed to continue hiking the trail thru the pandemic. The trail never
officially closed, and they reported having no problem re-supplying 1-2 times a
week whenever hiking thru a trail town.
I arrive at Rausch Gap Shelter around 5:00 PM, shortly after
the thru hikers arrived. It was an older shelter with space for 6 people, along
with several tenting spaces nearby. The bathroom was nearby, and a piped spring
directed the water within 10 yards of the shelter, which was very convenient!
None of the hikers showed any signs of being sick so I opted
to sleep in the shelter. We told trail stories and listened to music. I was
getting the thru-hiker experience that I always wished for. Thankfully, I did
not get sick as a result. Thanks to Mom’s prayers, God was looking out for me.","Peter’s Mountain Shelter

Shelter, Rt. 645 and Rt. 501.
Yet another long day on the trail. Fortunately, my pack was
relatively light, and the weather was nice.
The trail was nearly flat with a few ups and down along the
way. Again, thank God for that!
Like the day before, I recall passing thru miles of un-inhabited
forests, listening to the wind, birds, and waterfalls along the way. This is
what I was hoping for along this stretch. It was very therapeutic indeed!
I arrived at the 501 Shelter around 5:00 PM shortly after
the thru hikers arrived. I quickly discovered the nearest water source was a
half mile away. I opted to join them in a shuttle into the nearest town to get
water for me and dinner for them. When we returned, I cooked and ate dinner at
the picnic table just outside the shelter.
The elderly “Innkeeper” lived in a house adjacent to the
shelter. He came out to meet and interview us after dinner. He wanted to make
sure we were not “day” hikers or people looking for a place to party at. We then learned the shelter was originally built as a pottery barn. Hence, the large sunroof in the center. After
he left, we quietly entered the unlocked shelter and went to sleep.","Rausch Gap Shelter

The day was shorter than the prior 2 days, but still long
and hard. It was cool and windy, and the stops were infrequent. I tried my best
to enjoy my last full day on the trail, setting me up for a 10 mile hike out
the following morning. My blisters were still hurting but were manageable and
never popped.
I arrived at the Eagle’s Nest Shelter around 4:00 PM. The
only person there was a thru hiker named Roman that was hiking the entire
trail. She started mid-February, got off the trail for 6 weeks when the plague
got worse, then returned to the trail early May. She told me her hometown was
Berlin CT, which turns out to be adjacent to my hometown of Southington. Like
me, she often hikes on Ragged mountain for conditioning.
After dinner, two overnight hikers arrived. They setup a
tent about 100 yards away and lived locally. The lady had completed hiking the
entire AT over the course of 5 years. Her father was with her. He had hiked
most of it and was turning 80 later this year. God bless him!
One of the other thru hikers came into camp early evening
and slept in the shelter. There were 3 of us in the open-faced shelter, spaced
about 6 feet apart from each other. Nobody snored and we slept well.","Rt. 501 Shelter

The first 8.5 miles were on mostly flat terrain with a few
ups and downs. The last half mile was a steep 500’ decent into the gap in Port
Clinton. Along the way I tried to schedule another day of slack-pack hiking 15
miles northbound. Driver Mike was not available, and I could not find anyone
else to drive me. Hence, I knew this would be my last day on the trail this
spring.
I arrived at the Reading Railroad station at 12:20 PM and
walked a short distance to my car. I then began the long drive home, traveling
about 220 miles in 4.5 hours. I was glad to be coming back home to my family, a
hot shower, and home cooked meals.","Eagle’s Nest Shelter

of days on the tail by 4 days. I now feel ready to complete a 2-week section
hike in the fall and future years God willing.
Lessons Learned
Bring a winter sleeping bag for late Spring hikes as it can
dip below freezing at higher elevations. 
Bring a hat to sleep with. A bandana works, but not as well. 
Try to schedule slack packing days at the start, middle and
end.
Wear heat reducing insoles to help prevent blisters on the
bottom of my feet. 
Write down important names, hostels, and phone numbers in
case my phone dies.
Just because I can slack-pack 25 miles does not mean I
should!
Order a lightweight single person tent – done.
Order new trekking poles to replace my old ones – done.",,View Entry,"May 23, Sat",0
