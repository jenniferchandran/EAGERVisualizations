Ausy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625502,Made the announcement today to those outside my immediate family - lots of support (so far) and encouragement. My wife is on board with support and encouragement ( or maybe she is just tired of hearing me talk about the AT ? ) Booked the hostel room for my arrival and transportation from MARTA station and to Amicalola Falls.  I have looked forward to taking on this challenge for some time (i.e. - years) and am super excited to get to Springer and start putting one foot in front of the other !,,View Entry,"Dec 30, Mon",0
Ausy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625599,"Back from New Years and the Pasadena Rose Bowl Parade / Hollywood little 3 day trip.   Now back into hikes in prep for the great adventure beginning in 3 months.  Had a great 8 mile hike yesterday in the Gold Field mountains just north and east of the Superstitions.  This morning we did an easy 9 miles over rolling desert in an area referred to as ""Dog Bone"".  I am fortunate to belong to a great hiking club - the Pebble Creek Hiking Club - and am able to hike 4 - 5 days a week.  Our hikes range from 7 - 12+ miles with elevation gains of a few hundred to a couple thousand feet typically.  I have been in the desert and hiking here for a little over a year and enjoy the weather, warm climate, desert plant (cactus, cactus, cactus) and animal (rattlesnakes, torantulas, wild burros) life, many varieties of birds, and the desert mountains.   But it is very different from hiking in my adopted former home state of New Hampshire and from what the AT is going to throw at me.  Can't wait to begin the adventure !",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Sat",0
Ausy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625607,"Today is Sunday, a day off from hiking. I typically hike with the hiking club 5 days a week. Am working on finalizing and fine tuning my gear. Have decided to upgrade my sleeping bags with newer / lighter ones. Am looking at the Therm-A-Rest Hyperion 20, REI Magma 15, and Nemo Kayu 15 for winter and REI Magma 30 and Nemo Disco 30 for summer. All have pretty good reviews. I have pretty much decided on down vs synthetic for the warmth to weight ratio and packability of down. Any comments / experience from any hikers who may read this ? Otherwise some final tweaking and I am all set. On paper my base weight should be about 24 1/2 lbs with 4 days food and 2 liters of water bringing me up to around 37 lbs. I may cut back 1 days worth of food to start and may cut back 1 liter on water after I start once I see how plentiful water is along the trail. Comments and questions are welcome and thanks for following me. Let the adventure begin !",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Sun",0
Ausy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625950,"Continuing desert hiking training and final gear review / revisions.  Had a good 13 mile unstructured bushwack hike climbing and scrambling up, down, and around a series of peaks and washes.  Slept in my tent on air mattress to ensure they are in good shape.  Had to adjust tent poles shock cord tension but otherwise both tent and sleeping pad were good.  I will be treating seams and rain fly with waterproofing since it had been in storage for some time. Now trying to figure out how to post pics from my phone to entries.  Have done on desktop but web site interface very different on phone and haven't figured yet how to do it.  If anyone can explain how to. please let me know.",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Sun",0
Ausy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627120,"Although I am not overly concerned with the possibility of my contracting the virus or my ability to cope with it on the trail I have become increasingly concerned with the ability to resupply, closing of hostels, ability to hitch hike to and status of establishments in trail towns, and the bigger societal aspect of contributing to the potential of knowingly or unknowingly spreading the virus through interaction along the trail, hostels and towns.  I will be heeding the ATC call to postpone my hike.  That means I will not be living the dream this year.  I can't selfishly think only of myself, and I hope others make the difficult right choice.  Ausy",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Thu",0
