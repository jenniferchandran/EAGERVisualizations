Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624440,"This month (actual day not in stone yet) one year from now, I will be flying to Georgia to begin hiking the Appalachian Trail. The goal is to complete a thru hike. 
They say this journey is life changing. I imagine that to be true, one can’t hike nearly 2200 miles over approximately 6 months, through 14 states carrying just the bare essentials on your back and not be changed in some way.  This will be an enormous challenge for me and one that will take all the courage I have.  I will be tested in every way, physically, mentally and spiritually. I can attempt this because I have an incredible husband and children who support me and above all else, believe in me, which in turn helps me believe in myself. And if I can’t for any number of reasons complete the trail, at the very least, I will have tried. No shame in that.
 The AT has held a big part of my heart for many years now. I have a list of reasons why I yearn for this trail. In the end, and an end is one thing guaranteed for all of us. I don’t want to have any regrets. No “ wish I did.” No “I should have.” If I’ve learned anything, we are here, on this earth, for only a limited amount of time, we don’t know how long that time will be and we can be a dreamer or a doer. I’m choosing the latter. 
It’s a desire deep in my soul. Some will understand, many won’t. This is okay. It’s my story to live.  The task of preparing for this will consume most of the next twelve months. I have spent countless hours reading every book about the AT that I could get my hands on, reading blogs from past thru hikes, watching u tube videos, researching gear, following current hikers, learning about mail drops and resupplying and making lists but now, the real preparation will being: Conditioning by body and my mind for this epic journey. 
I post this today because, while I’m not brave, I am determined. I have fears about all that lies ahead, but above all, I’m excited for the challenge. And if I put it out there, if I say it out loud and share my intentions, then it brings it one step closer to becoming a reality.
So if you should see me with a gigantic pack strapped to my back out training over the next 12 months, say, maybe in the supermarket walking up and down the isle (kidding, well maybe not) give me a shout out and perhaps a few words of encouragement because Lord knows I’m going to need it! 
Now off to chase that dream....",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Fri",0
Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624441,"I was first introduced to the Appalachian Trail when I was in my mid-20's. At the time, I belonged to a photography club. Each month, they (the club) would bring in a guest speaker. This one particular month, a man came in to tell his story of his journey on the Appalachian Trail. He shared with us a slide presentation (yes, photo slides! I’m that old) of amazing photos he had taken during his six months on the trail. His storytelling was such an inspiration, I was in awe and remember thinking that I too would love to do that “someday."" That was the spark that lit a small flame. I had no way of knowing at that time, it would become a burning fire inside me.
The idea of hiking the AT was a fantasy for more than 21 years after I first learned of the trail. I was a wife and a stay at home mother. I had a full family life with all its responsibilities. I was busy and happy. A 6-month adventure during those years were not an option or a possibility and I had different priorities. The intrigue of the trail never left me though, and I still believed in “someday.” As my children grew and I had more “me time,” I started to focus a little on my needs. I was overweight and under active. With encouragement from a friend, I joined a running group and in time, began to enjoy running. With more confidence in myself and more time on my hands, my desire to try hiking grew. So, when a friend said she would join me on a weekend hike to the AMC High Huts in the White Mountains of NH, I laced up my boots and headed North. That trip was magical, and the flame that was sparked 20 something years earlier began to grow. In the 5 years that followed, there were numerous weekend hikes up to the Huts. The mountains were calling me and I heard and responded to their call. There is an indescribable feeling when you’re standing on top of a mountain that you just summited, a mountain that took every ounce of energy inside you to get you there. When all you can see is pure untouched wilderness as far as the eye can see. My words fail miserably to describe the grandeur of it all. As faith would have it, on these hikes, I would cross paths with several Appalachian Thru-Hikers. It was an opportunity to hear their stories of the trail and I ate it up! I had so many questions for them. Infatuated with their stories, I began buying and reading all the books about the AT I could find. This, in turn, added more fuel to my dream of hiking the trail. Over the last 4 years, I have invited everyone and anyone who was in proximity of me, to hike with me and would talk endlessly about the allure of a thru-hike. If you knew me, you knew the AT was on the top of what we now refer to as a “bucket list."" Sadly, there were no bites. How does a dream become a reality? When you set your intentions. When you say it out loud. When you believe it to possible. Several months ago, while in REI, I picked up an Appalachian Trail Thru-Hike Planner. I brought it home and read it cover to cover. It was then, I decided it was time to have a serious conversation with my family. 
Although preparing for the trail will take months, in the sense of researching and purchasing all the gear needed to live, cook and sleep in the woods for six months, preparing resupply boxes to be sent to the trail, making sure things at home are in order and physically getting my body ready for the demands of the trail, I think the sacrifices of 6 months of hiking will ultimately be the biggest challenge. The trail will be inherently hard. There is no doubt, I will sore, cold, tired and dirty. I will be afraid at times, other times feel lonely and there will be no comforts of home. The trail will be a trial!
No doubt finishing the trail is the ultimate goal, but most people are out there for more personal reasons. For me, self-growth tops my list and that’s a big one for me as I have always been reluctant or more truthfully, afraid, of doing things alone. Self-discovery: to learn what I’m capable of. To experience nature. To push myself physically and challenge myself beyond my comfort zone. And to live a simplified life for a little while. That is what I’m hoping to attain from this journey.
This will be an epic challenge. The Appalachian Trail is not a walk in the woods, it will test who I am to my core. In addition to the physical challenge, I believe the mental challenge may be the biggest obstacle. How does one strengthen their mental muscle? Can they? With the positive physical gains I have made over the last few years, I suspect, in turn, it has helped my mental game to some degree. A successful thru-hike will take drive and determination to see it through. Is that something that can be built or is it something one inherently has? If I’m being honest, I don’t know if I have what it takes to complete the trail, what I do have is a desire to try.",,View Entry,"Apr 01, Mon",0
Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624443,"Came off the trail yesterday with so much more love, confidence, drive and desire after experiencing four amazing days and 41 miles section hiking the AT from Lee Ma to North Adams. For me, it was what is called a “shakedown hike”, an opportunity to carry all the gear that I will be taking with me in March when I attempt my thru-hike. My take aways were plentiful as I learned so much in these four short days. I learned 31.5 lbs is considered heavy by thur-hikers standards and I need to work on lowing my pack weight. I learned to always carry a backup in case your water filter fails you. I learned that my new tracking device only works if l truly know how to operate it. I learned that mice like my sleeping bag as much as I do. I learned my body can be sore and my feet tired but I can still feel incredibly wonderful. I learned just how strong my legs are. Climbing down can sometimes be just as hard as climbing up. I like the sound of rain on my tent but definitely prefer the sun on my back. There are many different degrees of MUD. Pepperoni and a cheese stick wrapped in a tortilla makes the most delicious trail lunch and Snickers can and will help you up the mountain! It was an opportunity to learn by doing and I believe in that respect, it was successful.And amongst all the lessons learned, we shared smiles when we were blessed with trail magic. We had great conversations over many miles (except for on the ups, nearly impossible to talk then?) We met and shared shelters with some amazing and interesting people. There was singing and a little swearing. We sweat and we smelled but we came away feeling proud with a overwhelming feeling of accomplishment.",,View Entry,"May 26, Sun",0
Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624444,"This past week was an amazing self growth experience for me. I did my first solo backpacking trip. I spent five days on the Appalachian Trail (AT) starting in Cornwall Connecticut hiking to great Barrington in Massachusetts. It was 45 memorable miles. The temperature was humid and in the high 90s, the bugs could carry you away and then there was the rain and despite all that, I had an amazing time! I met some exceptional people who were kind and encouraging. I experienced incredible beauty in the mountains, hiking in the woods and through the fields. Truthfully, I was nervous to go alone. I find hiking (most everything really) more enjoyable when shared with a friend. As it turned out, alone was how I was meant to be. I returned home happy that I braved the solitude and have gained a little more confidence in myself and my capabilities. Today I’m stronger for it.",,View Entry,"Aug 26, Mon",0
Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624451,"I did it! Made it official. One way ticket to Atlanta Georgia....booked! I leave home on March 4th. Tom, my wonderful and supportive husband and my son Rob will accompany me on the flight. My daughter Kelly, will fly from her home in Wisconsin to join us. Together we will spend two nights at Amicola Falls Lodge where we will celebrate my sons birthday. I plan on beginning my hike at the approach trail to Springer Mountain on March 6th the day of his 20th birthday. 
I already know how hard it’s going to be to say goodbye to them. I anticipate a tearful goodbye  but I’m so very grateful to have a family who loves and supports me! Without their encouragement and belief in me, this crazy dream of mine would never be possible.",,View Entry,"Sep 10, Tue",0
Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624695,"Physical preparation.
I have never been athletic. An athlete is not even a word I would use if asked to describe myself.  In fact, quite the opposite is true. Yet despite how I view myself, over the last several years I have managed to run four half marathons. Although It was I who did the actual running, I believe the successful completion of those races were due to the coaching I received. More specifically, a given training plan. A printed paper, a 3 month guide, a schedule, a written formula for success that I put on my refrigerator followed fatefully and checked off daily.
Long distance hiking is different. I’ve heard it said, the best way to physically train for a thur-hike is to hike.  That makes a lot of sense and yet I feel there may be more to it. Over the last seven months leading up to my start date, I have tried to consistently run three to four miles two times a week and I attended a local gym where I work on strength training and balance. Throughout the summer, I hiked as often as my schedule allowed but sadly there is no “How to Successfully Complete an Appalachian Trail Thru-Hike Training Plan” hanging on my refrigerator.
Social media is full of people offering their ideas and advice. You don’t have to look far to find a multitude of different opinions. Some even say, “no training needed, you’ll get your trail legs while hiking the trail.”
I personally feel I need to do more. I want to feel better prepared before I set out on my journey. Today I took my pack to the gym, wore it with all my gear, set the treadmill on rolling hills and walked for seven miles. I can tell you, it’s definitely more enjoyable hiking seven miles in the woods but the ability to bang out the miles on a consistent basis I believe, is invaluable for preparing my body for the stress it will be enduring day after day while I am on the trail. In addition to the added treadmill training, it is my intention to add some stairs into my weekly routine. 
Over the next four months, this is how I plan to physically conditions my body in the hopes of building my cardio endurance, strengthening my body to handle the weight of my pack and most importantly, aid in preventing injury. Because, let’s be real here, a body in its mid fifty’s is going experience some pain. So I will take the advice of those who have gone before me and start slow when I begin the trail, keeping my daily miles around eight to ten. 
Yet with all of that, there are no guarantees I will make it to Maine. I will however feel more confident in my ability, and that can only help me reach my goal.“Preparation doesn't assures victory, it assures confidence.” Amit Kalantri",,View Entry,"Nov 01, Fri",0
Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625280,"My why.
I was twenty five years old when I lost my dad. He died much too young. Cancer, more specifically a brain tumor took him from our family. His birth name was Robert Henry Vattes, to me he was dad, but most simply called him Bob. 
A true outdoorsmen. His passion for fishing would have him up before the sun and on the shores of the Wachusett reservoir, the “Resi,” as he referred to it. Occasionally, I would go with him. We would walk in the woods for what felt like miles to get to “his spot” there, he would set his fishing polls in their holder near the edge of the shore where the water meets the sand. Sitting on the shore, he’d take out his yo-yo and ever so patiently watch and wait for a fish to bite, that  yo-yo going up and down, up and down, up and down. As a young girl, I thought of this as pretty boring. Now looking  back, I understand the allure and the peace it must have brought him. 
Fishing wasn’t his only passion. 
He was an avid hunter and would often head into the woods with rifle in hand. We (my sisters and I) were taught responsibility and respect for firearms at a young age. We always ate whatever was brought home. Having a mother who is 100% Italian meant everything went into the spaghetti sauce! And it was always delicious! 
He never brought me along on any of those hunting trips. I’m certain it was for my own safety but as the only male living in a house with 4 females, I’m sure he valued the solitude of the woods. 
Trapping was another sport he enjoyed. Of the three, this is where I hold most of my memories of him. Tagging along, sometimes through the woods on foot, sometimes down the river by canoe, I’d watch as he set and checked his traps. I learned about many of the animals that make their home along the river banks. Muskrat, mink, otter, fox and beaver. It was there, I was taught the circle of life. 
As I write this, I realize the way he lived his life may be controversial to some. My intention is not to stir emotions or anger in anyone who does not agree with these practices but only to say it was my foundation. To my father, it was a life of purpose and passion.
Although hiking or backpacking was never something I was introduced to as a child, I did grow up camping. It was how we vacationed each summer. The 1979 Rockwood pop up pulled by my dads Ford pickup.  I’m sure to my parents, it was the most economical and affordable way to take a family of five on vacation every year but to us, it was nothing but pure fun! To this day, nothing carries founder memories then the smell of a campfire. 
Maybe growing up this way somehow laid the foundation for my love of the trial. Perhaps being surrounded by nature gives me another chance to feel my dads presence. There is no denying, walking through the woods brings me joy. 
Alaska was on the top of my dad’s bucket list. A dream of someday seeing the wilderness country. A fitting choice for the outdoorsman that he was. Unfortunately, that dream never happened. He never had the opportunity. He died at just forty-nine years old. I did not know at the time what an impact losing him at such a premature age would have on how I view life and ultimately the way I choose to live mine.
Ironically, at forty-nine, I was diagnosed with cancer and on my 50th birthday, underwent surgery to have a melanoma removed from my right shin. A small scare given the history and the timing, however today, I’m  blessed to already have four more additional years on this earth than did my father. Consequently, I now look at things a little differently. Truth is, life is a gift. A precious gift not to be taken for granted. How much time do we have? That’s a question with no known answer. One only hopes to have a long life with the time to do all the things they dream of. Often we wait, putting off experiences, saying someday, but for some, someday never comes.
So why am I hiking the Appalachian Trail? I saw a YouTube video today that really summed up “my why.” The title: Everyone Dies But Not Everyone Lives. It went on to say there was a hospital study done of one hundred elderly people facing death, they were asked their biggest regret in life. They all said it wasn’t the things they did in life that they regretted but the things they didn’t do. The dreams they never pursued. Powerful stuff! 
It also went on to say, people don’t choose dreams, dreams choose them and to then ask the question, do you have the courage to follow the dream that picked you? More powerful stuff! 
Thru-hiking the AT - this crazy, epic dream that chose me. I’d like to believe my dad is in someway behind it. I have often wondered if he were alive today, would I have his support and encouragement? Would he join me on the trail?  Perhaps just a section...where the fishing is good. ??",,View Entry,"Dec 14, Sat",0
Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626100,"Transition. It’s a word I find myself using quite often these days. We are currently getting our house ready to be put on the market. The house my husband and I built 15 years ago. The house we raised our family in, the house we saved for and dreamed about building during the first 12 years of our marriage. With our children now grown and a growing desire to simplify life, selling our home is something I’ve been wanting to do for a few years  and yet, now, it’s seems painfully very bittersweet. Many years of celebrations and wonderful memories were made in this house. I continue to tell myself it’s not the walls and roof that make a house but the memories made inside, and those,  I can take with me - for they will always be stored in my head and in my heart. The older I get I find myself seeking a simpler life, an easier life, one of minimal material possessions. Its funny how priorities change and those “things” that once meant so much, along with the desire to acquire, becomes obsolete. 
I am so stressed and yet blessed all at the same time.The timing is certainly not ideal and given the choice I wouldn’t be packing up everything I own in life, selling my house, preparing to building a much smaller one and leaving in less than a month on the biggest 6 month adventure of my life all at the same time! And though I do believe we all have choices in life, life often unfolds on its own time. Seriously, who am I to question or complain. All good stuff happening - I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed. 
So as the boxes head into storage and the “little things” that we never got around to fixing now get attention, I’ll relish in the memories and hold back the tears. I can only hope that the family that lives here next will love our house much as we do. When my departure date comes, I’ll pause a little longer before heading out the door for what will most likely be my last. 
If all goes as planed, and honestly, who knows, our current house will sell quickly and I will be coming back from the trail to a new home. While I’m heading North through the woods, my husband will be overseeing all that is involved with selling and rebuilding. I feel confident leaving it in his very capable hands. His plate will be full in addition to working full time and yet, he still plans on visiting me occasionally along the trail. Couldn’t be more thankful for the wonderful man that he his! 
My days have been consumed by everything involving the house and in turn, has left me with little time to obsess over my gear. I’m choosing to look at that in a positive light and I’m trusting my gear choices will serve me well. If not, I will figure it out along the way, right?  
As busy as I find myself, in truth, it has not keep the fears of my impending epic test of endurance from setting in. The nerves are all to real and lately at the forefront of my thoughts. I’ve been asked the question more than once, are you nervous? Heck ya I am. But I’m also filled with excitement and great anticipation! I’ve done a pretty good job of convincing myself that it’s normal to have all these feelings. After all, I’m about to step very far out of my comfort zone! I know that is where growth begins and I’m ready and willing. 
It’s nearly time to ...stop talking it and start walking it. And so, it is with a grateful heart I prepare to let go all that was and step boldly into whatever will be....",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Fri",0
Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626859,"I’m finding it really hard to write here out on the trail. I’m nearly a week in and this is the first time I’ve picked up the pen. 
Saying goodbye on day one was really difficult. I didn’t know a heart could be filled with so much happiness and heartbreak all at the same time. Tom, Kelly and Rob flew to Georgia with me two days prior to my start date, and I got a surprise visit from my sister who drove eight hours up from Florida to see me off! We had two days of family fun and celebrated Rob’s 20th birthday before I started the trail on Friday morning. 
I started at the iconic arch at the beginning of the Approach Trail under a sunny but chilly sky and climbed the 600+ stairs up the most amazing waterfall I have ever seen. It’s beauty helped to distract me from the difficulty of carrying my fully-loaded pack that got weighed in at registration minutes before at 36 pounds. My legs felt strong, and I was thankful for all the time I put in preparing for this moment. 
I reached Springer Mt Shelter around 3 o’clock that afternoon and set up camp for what was to be the coldest and windiest night ever! The AT was going to test me right out of the gate and remind me that I truly was leaving all the comforts of life as I knew it, behind.
There was about nine of us camping at Springer Mt Shelter that night, but there was little conversation. It was just too cold to be standing around, and we all retired to our tents to shield ourselves from the relentless wind gusts. When morning came, we helped each other with frozen water bottles and made wind shields with our hands to keep our stoves lit so we could cook a hot breakfast and have a cup of coffee before hitting the trail.
I made new friend. His name is Jimmy, but we now call him “French Roast."" It’s a name I bequeathed on him and he accepted. A fitting name for his admiration for a finer cup of coffee.","Amicalola Falls Approach Teial

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626861,"I hit the trail around 9 am, with a destination of Hawk Mt Shelter. The following three days, the sun shined on the trail, but the nights were still cold. Nothing, however, like that first night on Springer. I have been happy so far with my gear choices. I love the warmth and comfort of my sleeping bag. It’s big, bulky and takes up a lot of space in my pack, I was cursing it while trying to stuff it in my pack prior to leaving for the trail. My attitude towards it now is one of thanks and great fullness. 
Although I have mostly been hiking the days alone, many of the same people I’ve met over the last few days have been staying at the same shelter at night. We are all taking it slow, hiking only 8 to 9 miles from shelter to shelter for the first week or two. The lower miles give our bodies time to adjust to the daily climbs and to amount of weight we carry. It’s nice to see familiar faces at the end of the day. On one or two nights, a campfire was built and we all sat around getting to know each out a little more.","Springer Mt Shelter

At Cooper Gap, there was a husband and wife from Atlanta cooking hamburgers for all the hungry hikes coming down off the mountain. And at Woody Gap, there was two guys making chili dogs. In addition, they had chips and fruit and so much more! It was a welcome site, not only substantial fuel to get over the next mountain but a great morale boost as well. Such an amazing gift of generosity by people who just love the hiking community or who are past Thru- hikers themselves and just want to give back. 
I find myself heading into my tent around 6 pm for the night. It’s early in the traditional world but not out here in the woods.

I hit the trail at 6am and as promised the rain started. I hiked the first hour and half under the cover of darkness in the rain. I thought I would be fearful on the trail in the dark, but I knew there were others ahead of me and behind. We had all made a plan to stay the night at Neel Gap. I also had an overwhelming feeling that my dad was walking right beside me, like we had when I was a little girl. Any fear I thought I would have, to my surprise, just wasn’t in me.
The hike went up and over Blood Mountain, the highest mountain in Georgia thus far. The fog was thick and there were no views. I strapped my umbrella to my pack and it worked wonderful at keeping my upper half dry. The 7.3 miles to Neel Gap seem to fly.

I needed little else because I had sent myself a resupply box and had picked it up there the day before when I had come down off the trail. With all the morning preparations, we got a late start getting back on the trail. The plan was to push 11.5 to Lower Gap Shelter. We had four mountains to go over and I was struggling with the weight of my newly resupplied pack. 
French Roast, Baby Gap, Stone Man & Aura and their dog, Rou and I, hiked the whole day together. They are all a colorful group of individuals and our ages range from 29 to 66. I’ll share more about them in the future. For now, I’m happy our little group has formed and we all have each other's backs.

They also offed a variety of other supplies for the taking!  As past thru-hikes themselves, they knew, and had, exactly what a hopeful thru-hiker needed. 
We all feasted until we were full, then were generously shuttled into Hiawassee by Buttercup, where we got a room for the next two nights.  I’m sharing a room at the Budget Inn with my new southern friend Salt from Louisiana.

Greens are one thing I’m definitely lacking out on the trail.

Because a cup of coffee is a necessity ￼in the morning, I walked to the corner store. Walking to the Dollar Store to get our resupply for the next 4 days was also on the list. We walked to Mc Donald’s to get lunch, where I gouged myself on a Big Mac, fish sandwich, large fry and a large coke! Don’t judge, hiker hunger is real! 
We were also reunited with French Roast. He had left the trail a few days prior due to a pain in his knee and was hoping to rejoin our Tramily back on the trail, unfortunately, tomorrow he will be flying home to rehab his knee. We are all sad to see him go. He will be missed greatly. 
After lunch, I spent a few hours in my room resting and and catching up on my journal, uploading videos and photos. It’s been hard getting them to Kelly without WiFi and as a result, my YouTube channel has been somewhat delayed. 
The evening ended with all of us sharing pizza and stories in the hotel lobby before we retired to our room to repack for the trail in the morning.","

The goal was to hike 11.8 miles to Muskrat Shelter. We were all pretty excited because we would be crossing state lines into North Carolina and leaving Georgia behind. Although we are only 78 miles in on this 2,200 mile journey, crossing one state off seems like significant process. 
My legs felt strong coming off of my zero and the first 8 miles seem to fly by. That was until we got to the border. 
North Carolina set out right away to show me who was boss!  Not ten minutes after we crossed state lines, we were staring at our first 4700 footer. It would turn out to be one of three mountains we had to get over before arriving at the shelter. I struggled to get to camp.
I was lucky enough to get the last spot in the shelter. It had rained all day and was expected to storm all night. I was happy with the idea of sleeping in the shelter where I wouldn’t have to put my tent up in the rain and pack it up soaking wet in the morning.

We will be in town tomorrow and will regroup and reassess.  For today, I’m on trail.

Here in Franklin, the grocery stores and outfitters have remained open. Supplies seem plentiful.  All restaurants and food establishments are closed but are accepting takeout orders. We were able to fill our hungry hiker bellies and resupply for the trail.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627353,"I’m still trying to process all my feelings. The reality of remaining on trail was just not possible. Despite the enormous hurt in my heart, my head knows it was the right and responsible thing to do. With that said, I’m still having a difficult time believing this dream I’ve put so much time and energy into preparing for has come to such an abrupt ending.
The Covid-19 crisis has currently changed the world. Every single person has been affected by this pandemic. This is not just about me.  It’s a scary time for all of us, as these waters are uncharted and so unpredictable. 
My thoughts go to all of the health care workers putting their lives in danger. I think of all the small business that were forced to close, whose livelihood depends on customers and clients. I feel for all of the kids whose school year has been cut short and those once- in-a -lifetime events: proms, graduations, class trips have all been canceled. I’m sad for of all the couples who won’t be able to hold their dream weddings. I’m sad for all the elderly who live alone and are now evermore isolated.  And I cry for all who have died and those who have lost loved ones due to this horrible virus.  So much sadness, hurt and disappointment.   
Though, I realize not being able to continue my journey of walking through the woods, is minor and insignificant with all that humanity is dealing with, truth is, I can’t help feeling sorry for myself. One might consider that selfish, perhaps it is. 
When my trail family and I first learned that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) put out a request strongly urging all hikers to get off trail, we didn’t quite understand; wasn’t being outside, removed from society, breathing fresh air exactly where we should be?  We quickly discovered that although all of that is true, there was so much more to consider.  I will admit, for the first few days, the biggest concern was the availability of resupplies and support on trail. 
Slowly, we started getting word that stores, restaurants, hostels and shuttles were beginning to close. Support that hikers rely on was becoming limited and yet, I still wanted to push on, not wanting, or ready, to believe that my thru-hike could realistically be over. 
Word continued to come in with more and more closures and cancellations. The NOC closed, the ATC Headquarters closed, Fontana Damn Lodge closed. At first, they closed the Smokey Mt National Park to everything but foot traffic but within days, it was shut down to that also, leaving no way to hike that section of the trail. Maryland and New Jersey closed all shelters and privies on the AT indefinitely. Trail Days in Damascus was cancelled and little by little any hope of staying on trail began to diminish.  
With all of that, there was even more to consider. The ATC was asking us to comply with their request to leave the trail.  For them to ask this of us was huge. The trail is what they are all about. Promoting the trail is what they do so this was not something to take lightly. We as hikers need to come into the small towns along the trail to resupply, regroup and recharge by getting a hot shower, washing our clothes, eating a hot and hearty meal, etc.  Possibly exposing those we come in contact with in town, or town folk unknowingly exposing us, would potentially spread the virus. If that should happen, and medical care is necessary, we would be putting a burden on some of these small towns that already have limited access to medical care. Resupplying in town would also be taking limited resources from these small towns, again, adding a burden to local town folks. 
Many of these trail towns have relied on the hiking community in past years to bring prosperity to their financially challenged towns. They have always welcomed, encouraged, protected and supported hikers with open arms.  This year, it seems the tables have turned, it’s up to the hikers to protect and support these small towns by doing whatever is necessary. Preventing the spread of the virus has become the utmost importance. 
There has been a lot of debt on social media groups about those who choose to stay on trail and those who have chosen to comply with the ATC request.  For me, in the end, I know leaving the trail was the right decision. I could say I had no choice, in reality, I guess maybe I did, we all have choices...we just have to be prepared to live with them. 
No one knows when the world will return to what we once considered normal. I think that is what is most concerning. For now, I’ll take one day at a time and find gratitude in knowing my family members are all healthy. 
I will continue to hold on to hope that I will, when this is all over, return to the trail that has, for a long time, held a huge part of my heart.","

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628641,"After leaving the trail on day 17 due to Covid-19 and nearly three months under a stay at home order, today I have returned to the trail.


I couldn’t be happier to be back on my beloved AT and even more happier that Carebear, Insight and French Roast are here. We were reunited in Franklin N.C. yesterday. Today the four of us started back on trail where Insight & Carebear came off in March. I repeated the 11.2 miles from Winding Gap Stair to Wayah Bald Shelter where we are staying in tonight. I was a day ahead of them in March and had already hiked those miles before I left the trail last time. They, in true Thur-hiker fashion, didn’t want to miss any miles and I opted to rehike them rather then get back on where I had came off in a March and hike alone and have to take a zero day to wait for them so we could all go forward together. 


We left the Budget Inn in Franklin at 8:30am shuttled to the trail head by Ron and under sunny skies the four of us began what I am now referring to as, Appalachian Trail Take Two!


Given the fact that we have now lost nearly 3 months of our planed North Bound Thur-hike, the sad reality is, we will not be able to finish on Katahdin before it closes in mid October.  Because of this, our plan now is to return to where we got off, hike through the Smokies and at some point flip up to Katahdin and start hiking South Bound. This will allow us to finish our thru-hike with no closing restrictions.  Though this is not the dream thru-hike I have held in my heart for so many years, I have come to terms with it, what’s most important to me at this point is just to be out here hiking it in some capacity. 


My attitude this time out is one with no expectations. I vowed to take it one day at a time and just enjoy whatever the trail has in store for me. 


Today started out almost surreal.  The feeling of being back on trail brought me such happiness, joy truly filled my heart once again. 
Around 6 miles into our hike we found a wonderful area with a few picnic tables, a perfect place for four hungry hikes ready to break for lunch.  We nearly had finished and the sky rumbled overheard with A loud clash of thunder. With about 5.5 miles still to go, we quickly packed up and started back on trail hoping to make it to camp before the rain.  That, was wishful thinking. The sky opens up and the rain soaked us, turning the trail into a river. We even had hail for a brief time.  Lightning flashed around us while the thunderstorm seemed to follow us right up the trail. At that moment we all question why we wanted so badly to be back out there. 


I struggled and found it challenging carrying the weight of my pack. My legs and cardio are now staring over and It will take some time to feel strong again on trail. I knew that coming out here, tough it was still disappointing to me.


And yet, even soak, hiking through thunder and lightning getting my ass kicked over 11 + miles today, I wouldn’t have wanted to be anywhere else in the world. 


Tomorrow we have 10.6 miles to get to Wisser Bald Shelter where we will meet up with Turtle and  we will become a merry group of five.","Winding Stair Gap

I didn’t sleep well and was up at 5:30 making coffee. Mornings are my favorite time on trail. Sitting with a cup of coffee, watching the sunrise, listening to the birds wake and anticipating the day ahead. It was hard putting on my wet socks and shoes that had no chance of drying out from the day before. The forecast was calling for rain again today, so I saw no need to put on the only pair of dry socks I had.  Carebear and Insight were ready and headed out at 8:00am, French Roast and I where a half hour behind leaving camp. 
The first 4 miles were relatively easy. The trail was pretty flat and I felt better than yesterday. We met Turtle at Burning Town Gap and we began the climb up Tellico Gap. Stoping to take a break and eat lunch at Cold Spring Shelter that was conveniently located right on the AT.  An unusual and rare treat to have a shelter you don’t need to walk an additional side trail to reach. 
I had a spam and mustard sandwich with Pringle’s. It’s amazing how things that I would never eat at home are so enjoyable on trail. 
We had about 2.2 miles to camp when we got caught once again in a server thunderstorm. Nearly to the top Bald and on the ridge, Carebear, French Roast and I were stoped in our tracks as lightning hit the ground right in front of us. It was so close we all screamed. Around the corner was Insight and we all dropped our poles and sat on our packs as the rain turned to hail. Eventually the storm let up and we were able to make it to camp, arriving around 3:30. There were 3 hikers already there. Again we were soaked and cold and made quick work of changing out of our wet clothes and making a hot meal. Again tonight we are sleeping in the shelter. Hoping I’m able to get a better night sleep tonight. We’ll see.

Everything has grown in and there were several trees blown down blocking trail. I scrambled up, over, under and between several. 
We arrived here at the Nantahala Outdoor Center better known as the NOC about 12:30. The 5 of us had reserved bunks for the night but were unable to check in until 3pm. With some time to kill, we picked up our resupply boxes at the outfitters and sat riverside enjoying a cold beer. 
Unfortunately laundry facilities were not open due to Covid-19 restitutions  so we washed our clothes in the bathroom sink and hung them on the porch rail to dry. I’m not convinced they will be dry by morning so it may be another morning of getting into wet clothes.

I hiked pretty much together the whole day with Carebear and Insight. It was nice to chat and learn a little more about their lives and it was a welcome distraction from the continual incline. 
We stopped for lunch at the only open view we got all day on trail. I tried a new lunch today. Fritos and Bean Dip with jalapeños!  I enjoyed it immensely. Though I hope I don’t regret it in the middle of the night. 
Sassafras Shelter is pretty swanky by Shelter standers. It has two floors, a nice porch with benches and a cooking area.  We are sleeping in the shelter again tonight due to the predicated rain. There are only two others here with us. Amy and Caroline. They are from Nashville and are out for a section hike.  
There is a very different vibe on the trail now. It’s quite.  We have been back on trail 4 days now and have seen very few people. There were times in March where 20 or 30 hikes would be staying at the same shelter. Now the feeling is of more solitude. I wouldn’t want to be out here now without Insight, Carebear and Turtle.

My pack was loaded with 4 days worth of food after receiving my resupply box the day before. Given the fact I had so much food, Insight joked that my new trail name should be ‘Pantry’. I think I’ll stick with ‘Snapshot.’
As promised, Shuckstack did not disappoint. We reached the summit and Carebear and I climbed the fire-tower to see a 360-degree  view of the mountains. It was breathtaking! 
In addition to the spectacular view, our first day in the Smokies reminded us that we share the forest with many. I saw my first bear today. First heard the snapping of branches, a big grunt and then saw the back end of the black bear. It stopped all of us in our tracks. After that, we made lots of conversation so as not to startle him and make him aware of our presence.  Snakes are apparently very popular here as well. We came across two of them on the trail today.

After a quick cup off coffee, we were on trail by 5:15am. Only the light of our headlamps to guide us up the trail. We listened to a little Jerry Garcia, complements of Carebear’s download. It helped motivate all of us up the mountain, but was intended mostly to kept the bears away. 
There was no sunrise, no views to see, only fog, mist and wind.   Despite the lack of views, Carebear and I climbed the tower. We were the only ones there.

Ordered￼ a burger and a side of fried green tomatoes for lunch and took it back to my room. Figured why not eat the local favorites.
Spent most of the day relaxing in my room posting journals, uploading videos and plotting our next few weeks itinerary. ￼ ￼Hundreds of people on the streets of Gatlinburg. There is so much to see and do though I was happy to distance myself from the crowds and just keep my feet up. 
Carebear and Insight saved  me the trip and graciously offered to take my laundry and do it with theirs. Tomorrow I will hit the trail showered, with fresh clothes. ￼
Time for lights out. 7:30am Conductor Red will be here to shuttle us back to the trail where we will finish the second half of the Smokies.","

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628951,"Today was a great day. Fresh legs coming off a zero in Gatlinburg, perfect hiking weather, spectacular views, a mama bear with two cubs and a beautiful buck with velvet antlers! 
We were shuttled back to the trail by Conductor Red early this morning and made it to Charlie’s Bunion by 11am, where we enjoyed lunch with one of the most breathtaking view thus far. 
The terrain made for pretty easy hiking today and rewarded us with amazing views most of the day. I was happy. I also had a little surprise. A woman, her name is Susan, I later learned, stopped me on the trail as she was passing by and said “Hey, I know you, you’re Snapshot”. She said she had been following me and enjoyed reading my journals. We spoke for a few minutes before moving on. Susan, if you’re reading this, it was a pleasure to meet you today. 
Made it to camp about four o’clock. Tonight’s shelter is .4 off the A.T. down a side trail. It’s an additional walk after hiking 10.5 miles and not one most thru-hikers would choose to do. However, being in the Smokies, one must stay at the shelter. Stealth camping is not allowed. 
I do believe, today was the first day I hiked into camp with dry shoes and socks. Though it was not a day without rain. About an hour after we reached camp, the rain came down. 
Dinner was my rendition of a burrito. A flour tortilla with dehydrated pinto beans, rice and hot sauce. Not exactly Chipotle, but a pretty good second out here on the trail.￼ 
Sleeping in the shelter once again. I haven’t slept in my tent yet since returning to the trail. With the lack of hikers on trail now, the shelters have been relatively empty making it an attractive option to setting up my tent in  what seems to be a never-ending supply of rainfall. 
Cell service on trail has been spotty at best and tonight there is zero. I’m sure Tom will miss hearing from me, at least that’s what I’d like to believe ?","New Found Gap

8 hours of hiking in the relentless rain, wind and fog. There were no views. The three of us, Carebear, Insight and I walked in silence for most of the day, each of us silently wishing we were already at camp. 
Nothing noteworthy today except I used my rain skirt for the first time and I loved it. I also learned my two favorite pieces of gear are my umbrella and my sit pad. Both indispensable.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628953,"I made a bonehead move this morning and left camp without my water bottle and water filter. The mistake cost me 1.6 miles extra on top of our planned 10.4. I hadn’t realized I had left it behind until I went to take drink.  
I didn’t want Carebear and Insight to have to wait for me so they headed on and I went back towards the shelter to retrieve them.  
Plantly and Mr. Meaugie, a couple from Kentucky, who are also thru-hiking, were coming down the trail as I was heading back up. We had stayed in the shelter with them last night. We first met them back at Sassafras Shelter several days prior but lost them when they took a zero at the NOC. 
They generously ￼offered for me to leave my pack with them so I could move quicker up the trail. I took them up on their offer and we ended up hiking together the majority of the day. 
We caught up with Carebear and Insight about 4 miles from our destination and the five of us hiked together down into Davenport Gap where we were greeted by Baba and Stephanie. They are a couple from South Carolina who are here in Tennessee on vacation and had stopped at the gap with beer, chips, donuts and cookies! It was a delicious treat and we all sat roadside and enjoyed. 
The last two miles up to Standing Bear Farm included a massive set of rock stairs and a road walk under the highway. 
I’m sharing a cabin with Insight and Carebear tonight. Plantly and Mr Meaugie are staying here as well. They are nearby in the treehouse. Standing Bear is a unique place with very, very rustic accommodations. An outdoor shower and a washboard for doing laundry. It’s all part of the experience!","Cosby Knob Shelter

Insight had to get a shuttle into town for a new pair of shoes and Carebear need to get some supplies for her feet. Plantly also shuttled into town for a few things. Mr. Meaguie and I stayed at Standing Bear. 
We were on trail at 12:30 pm and didn’t make it to camp until 7 pm.  It was a hard day.  We picked up our resupply boxes at standing bear, the extra weight made us slow moving, the first four miles were a relentless steep grade up. 
Plantly and Meaguie are hiking with us for now, at least until we get to Hot Springs. It’s nice to have them in our group, I enjoy their company and I hope they stay with us. There aren’t any other Thru-hikers that we have met, only a handful of section hikers. The trail is very quiet now. Today, we never saw one other person. 
The 5 of us are the only ones here tonight. It’s raining again. My legs are tired and my feet sore. I hope tomorrow the sun shines all day.","Green Corner Rd/Standing Bear Farm

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628955,"Left camp about 9am. Carebear and Insight were about twenty minutes ahead of me and Plantly and Meaugi were still packing up camp when I left to hit the trail. 
We actually had cell service at the shelter last night and for a good 2 miles after leaving this morning. It was nice to be able to talk to Tom. My sister called as I was heading up the mountain, we chatted for a little while, then I called Danielle to catch up with her. The conversations helped pass the time and I caught up with Carebear and Insight before I knew it.
Today we hiked up Max Path.  It was as magical as I had it envisioned it would to be. ￼It took my breath away with it’s amazing 360 views. We hoped to camp on top of the patch and catch the sunset, however, there was an 80% chance of thunderstorms, so we made the decision to hike an extra few miles down to the shelter and played it safe. I was truly thankful we had nice enough weather to relax there for a while and eat lunch. I was soaking up the moment. 
Coming off of Max Patch was beautiful as well. We walked through a tunnel of Rodademdrands, passed some old wooden fences and saw some pretty cool mushrooms. Today may have been one of my favorite days on trail. 
The five of us are here tonight, Insight & Carebear, Meaugi & Plantly and myself. We are camping at Roaring Fork Shelter along with a dad and his two teenage daughters from Kansas who are out for a section hike. 
After dinner, Insight made a fire. It has been so rainy every night lending little opportunity for one. Tonight’s fire warmed my body and my heart.","Groundhog Creek Shelter 
",Roaring Forks Shelter ,"Jun 30, Tue",8.30
Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629084,"I was up at my usual 6:30am. The rest were still sleeping. I quietly got my bear bag down and made a cup of coffee. It never did thunderstorm last night though the predictions said 80%. I was a little disappointed that we played it safe and left Max Patch for the Shelter. I believe we would have seen an amazing sunset and sunrise. One can only hope there will be other opportunities to camp in such magical locations. Up until tonight, we have been pretty much been Shelter hopping. The Shelters are convenient because most have a water source, meaning a stream nearby, a privy and bear bag cables. The shelters are good protection from the elements and make camp life a little easier with all the conveniences but they are generally down low on the mountains, deep in the forest rarely allowing a view of the sky through the trees. 
Today I walked though a beautiful field. It was filled with wildflowers and berry bushes. I especially enjoy when the trail comes out of the woods and goes through open areas or down a road in town. The forest has its beauty, and today I loved seeing all the mushrooms but with all the rain, the forest is wet and dark most days lately. 
As I write this, I’m laying in my tent. We are stealth camping for the first time since returning to the trail. I’m happy to be in my tent, it brings me comfort. Plantly & Meaugi and Carebear & Insight are also in their tents, near by.","Roaring Forks Shelter

The forest was bright today. The sun shined all day and the hiking was downhill for several miles, a welcome change from all the rain we have been experiencing. God smiled on me and I was thankful for all I received. 
Though there was no cake and candles, Insight built a fire after dinner and my Tramily sang happy birthday to me. It was a perfect ending to a perfect day.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629086,"Last night,  I slept in my tent without my rainfly for the first time ever. It was wonderful. I could see the fireflies dancing in the air all around me. The moon was nearly full and it peaked out from behind the canopy of trees. The night was ever so still, not a breeze, not a sound. Silence lit only by moonlight. 
I woke to Plantly and Meaugie sitting on the picnic table quietly watching the sun rise through the trees. I joined them, made a coffee and soaked up the early morning air. 
We neroed into Hot Springs today. Laughing Heart Hostel is located right on the trail, we are staying here for the next few days. Carebear has been experiencing some feet issues, though the lower miles this week has helped some, taking a few days off to rest and repair is what she needs if she is going to be able to push onward. We are all on board with zeroing for  two days. 
After I settled into￼ my room, showered and did my laundry, Plantly and Meaugi and I headed into town to find lunch. I quickly put away a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, onion and mayonnaise￼, accompanied by a side of fries and a large diet Pepsi￼. 
When on trail, food is always on our minds and occupies ￼a good deal of our conversations. It seems we all have a craving for great big cheeseburgers when we get to town. My body definitely craves red meat out here. I also find myself wanting salad. Not surprising, fresh vegetables or any vegetable for that matter, is lacking in my diet. 
After lunch, we explored the area a bit. I had to make a stop at the Post Office to pick up a box Tom had sent me. I’m swapping out my winter sleeping bag for my summer bag now that we are through the Smokies. My summer bag is lighter and less bulky, I’m hoping it will free up some space and noticeable weight in my pack. We’ll see.
Later in the evening, the five of us headed downtown again. Of course it was another mission in search of food. Iron Horse Tavern was open and their website said they had live music, we were excited for dinner, a beer and some entertainment. There was no live music (do to COVID). However, dinner was delicious and the beer was cold!
COVID-19 is still alive. It’s easy to forget when you’re in the woods for days. It’s seems like a different world. There are days when I’m on the trail that the word COVID doesn’t even enter my mind. Then I come into town. I carry a face mask, we all do, we wear them in town and in common areas when close to others. We all do our best to be responsible citizens and respectful of the towns and folks we come in contact with. It is the world we live in now. There are moments in the woods I can escape it, but in the end, reality always returns.

The main attraction here is of course, the hot springs. Hot Springs Resort and Spa offers a hot tub experience complete with water piped in from the hot springs. People come from all over for its healing properties. It’s supposed to be good for the body and the soul. 
We tried to book an appointment for a session but there were no openings. I guess being 4th of July weekend and all. So, what to do, what to do? Tubing the river? No can do. Dock was taken out because high water levels a few days ago and has not been put back in. Sorry, no tubing today. 
With little else to do, Plantly and I spent a few hours sitting in the river. The others napped at the hostel or worked on editing videos. 
Laughing Heart Hostel has been a wonderful place to stay. The caretakers, Tigger & Chuck Norris have been so welcoming and very helpful. The hostel has everything we need and more.

There has been a slow leak in my air mattress. Today I got out the soapy water and a hose and tried to find where it was that the air was escaping.

The trail, up hill,  as is typical when leaving most every town. 
We were all stopped in our tracks as a mama bear and her cub were nearby on the trail. We gave them space and made them aware of our presence. The cub ran up the tree and mama waited until it was very high up, safely out of danger before she crossed the trail in front of us so we could pass.  It was a something to experience them in close proximity. 
We are camping on the summit of Rich Mountain. It will be a first for all of us as we are sleeping in the fire tower. I’m so excited to be staying here tonight!

I can’t describe the scenery and do it justice. I sat and soaked it in for a long time. I want to remember it forever. Mountains after beautiful mountains as far as the eye can see. The sky so blue, the clouds so close, like you can almost touch them. Every day, it’s still surreal that I am out here. That I am on this amazing adventure. I’m so thankful to have this opportunity.

I didn’t get the best nights sleep. It seems the repair job I did on my air mattress while at the hostel the day before, didn’t work. I woke several times last night because I was sleeping on the metal grate floor. Though I wasn’t the most comfortable, I loved sleeping up there and will remember my experience for a long time to come. 
We hiked approximately 3 miles to the nearest shelter, made coffee and breakfast and then hiked on. It was a 12 mile day - the trail was challenging. 
We also saw another bear and her cubs. It’s possible it was the mama and cubs we had seen just yesterday. 
Tonight, we are sleeping in the shelter again. Rain again. It started about an hour before getting to camp. We were able to cook our dinner and hang our food bags before it got heavy. 
I’m sitting in the shelter writing this, there is a bunny just 2 feet away from me. He/she isn’t timid at all and has been hanging here for 10 minutes now. She appears to be eating the rocks on the floor of the dirt shelter. Guessing she may be sharpening her teeth. It’s pretty awesome to watch her.

There was an amazing ridge walk that gave way to spectacular views. The five of us sat and enjoyed lunch, overlooking the valley with the mountains rising all around us. I appreciated the payoff for hiking an elevation gain of 1500ft in under two miles and a rock scramble that reminded me of those in the White Mountains. The ridge can be so treacherous that there is a bad weather bypass. The sun was shining, thankfully no bypass needed today. We were able to get the true experience with all of the glorious views. 
We also crossed the 300 mile mark today. I did a little happy dance in celebration.

The first 4 miles flew by, the trail was gentle to us. The forest was beautiful with light shining through the canopy of trees. Soon though, we were climbing up over 4400 ft, it was hard and very humid. 
We were all motivated to get the miles done and get to town as soon as possible. A good part of our day was spent talking about what we were going to eat at McDonald’s, dreaming about Cheeseburgers, French fries and ice cold Coca-Cola! ￼ ￼ 
Somewhere around the nine mile mark, Insight thought we needed a little motivational music and played Jimmy Buffett cheeseburger in paradise. I may have danced down the trail a little! ￼￼
The trail took us through a cow pasture which was pretty neat and a nice change from the tree covered forest. An old barbed wire fence with worn wooden posts lined the trail for several miles. I loved the old fence and couldn’t help but think￼￼ of the person or persons, who built it many years ago. 
Each morning I wake, I wonder, what does the trail have in store for me today? What new things will I see? What will I learn? I love being on this adventure. Each day is a gift.

It was warm, the window was open. Though the bunk house holds about 10, only one other hiker was staying there. All others were in cabins in the back of the property. 
I was woken by a loud noise just outside my window. It was dark, I was unable to see anything, only heard a lot of ruckus￼. An hour later, three police cruisers with blue lights flashing were here, I got up and went outside to see what was going on. Someone had abandoned a car right in the middle of the four way intersection just feet away from my window. The police officer asked if I had seen anyone. All the windows were busted out of the vehicle, the cop said they thought the front window had bullet holes but then decided it may have just been smashed with a baseball bat or something of the sort. My first thought when I came outside to see what was going on, was they had set up a roadblock or barricade at the intersection and was waiting for someone, after speaking to the officer I learned of the abandoned vehicle. They were waiting for the tow truck to come and remove the vehicle from the intersection. 
Nervous that whoever abandoned ￼the vehicle might be hiding out somewhere around the hostel, I was unable to go back to sleep.￼ Thus making my 8.3 miles today a struggle. 
I cried today. Reaching the top of Bald Mt. after a difficult climb, I was just overcome with tears. The vast beauty, Gods amazing creation, I had no control, my emotions overtook me. I wanted Tom to be there, to be with me in that moment, to be able see what I was seeing, to share this amazing experience with me. 
After I was able to collect myself, I tried my best to capture what my eyes were beholden. The shear natural beauty of the mountains that were all around me. I only hope the pictures and videos can somehow give even the smallest glimpse￼ of their magic.

Meaugi and Plantly shuttled from Erwin to Johnson City to pick up the mini van that would take the five of us to Massachusetts today. 
We got a late start leaving the Super 8 due to all the time spent on the phone with Baxter State Park in Maine. The logistics to be able to get into the park and summit Katahdin are difficult on a good day, Covid-19 has made it even more challenging. It seems Maine has opened the park and trails but are doing all they can to prevent A.T. hikers from coming in. 
We will be staying in Massachusetts at my house for a few days. This will allow us time to get Covid tested, print permits, fill out compliance forms, set up Resupply boxes for the hundred mile wilderness and swap out and or replace some gear, etc, etc.
Tom will then be driving us to Maine where we plan to camp in BSP for the night, hike up and down Katahdin, then the following day start the trail Southbound. It’s referred to as a flip flop. 
It’s not the way I envisioned my Thru-hike to go. The dream was to start at Springer Mountain Approach Trail in Georgia and hike North all the way to Maine and finish on Katahdin. A traditional Thru-hike, NOBO. 
For reasons unknown, this is not how it was meant to be for me. I’ve accepted that and I’m out here hiking the trail and am adjusting accordingly. For better or worse, 2020 is my year to get it done. It has been and undoubtedly will continue to be much more challenging this year due to all the logistics of the Covid-19 world we are currently living in.  
There is so much more pre-planning and a greater expense given all the closures of hostels, the lack of transportation from trail to town, the added expense of rental cars needed to flip from south to north. 
My tramily and I will persevere. We will continue to rise to all the challenges thru-hiking the A.T. in 2020 has thrown our way. One might have thought of it as simply walking in the woods, this year there is nothing simple about it. 
Tonight I will get to see my husband and my son. This makes my heart happy. They have been so supportive of my hike. I’ve missed them. I’ve come to realize even more then ever, how lucky I am to have not only them and my daughter but all of my extended family and so many friends who would go out of their way, do anything to help me on this crazy adventure I’m on.

The 14 day quarantine was out of the question so we opted for the testing. Tom also had to be tested because he will be driving us there and staying with us a few nights before we start the trail South. A negative test was to he results for us all. 
￼￼Walmart was our next stop. There we shopped for all the food we will need for the nine days it will take us to hike though the Hundred Mile Wilderness. Back at home, we put together our resupply boxes and figured out our food drop. The Shaw’s Hostel in Monson, Maine will be doing a food drop for us on day 4 of the 9 nine days.
White House Landing is located in the middle of the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  They have bunks, showers and are know for the best burgers in Maine. We had hoped to stay there a night, unfortunately,  they are not expecting thru-hikers this year, once again, due to Covid. 
With a small window of time left, I took Plantly and Meaugi to show them the area a little bit. They are from California and we’re happy to see my little corner of the world. We even stopped for a quick ice cream where we were joined by Mom and Roni￼. I was happy to see my dear friend, give her a hug and have her meet Plantly & Meaugi. 
When we returned home, there was a bag full off homemade chocolate chip cookies, hot out of the oven accompanied by a half dozen fireball shots! Sarah found out that I was in town ￼with my trail family! It was a wonderful gift for all of us and appreciated beyond words. 
It was also great to see Kate, though brief, her visit made me smile. I miss her and all my 5:30am ladies.

Our first stop leaving town was the post office. Everyone had packages they needed to mail back to their perspective￼ homes￼. A stop for lunch, a stop for gas, a stop at Walmart for a few last minute things and finally a stop in Monson, Maine at the Shaws Hostel where we dropped off our resupply. They will be meeting us halfway through the 100 mile wilderness with the supplies for our second leg. 
After arriving at Baxter State Park gate, we still had a half hour drive in the park to get to the campground￼ where Insight and Carebear and Plantly and Meaugi would be tenting for the night. It was late when we arrived and we were all hungry and tired from the long road trip.
While they got set up, Tom and I made hotdogs so we could all have a quick bit before he and I went back to Millinocket where we had a room booked for the night.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629567,"Katahdin did not go as we had hoped.  
Despite our efforts, we were unable to summit. Rain, fog and 65 MPH winds stopped us just 1.8 miles from the summit. 
We had gotten the weather report earlier in the morning and were told by the Ranger that this was our only window for the next three days. He said thunderstorms were coming in and we needed to leave immediately if we wanted any chance. The Ranger instructed us to turn around if we hadn’t reached the summit by 11am. 
Katahdin is a beast! It is 5+ miles of shear rock climbing. There are places where rebar drilled into the side of the rock is the only way up the mountain. Every move has to be calculated. 
It was made even more challenging due to the weather. The wind was whipping and the fog was rolling in. 
At 11 o’clock, we were still 1.8 miles from the summit. The rain started and we began hearing thunder. At that point, we made the decision to turn around. 
I was heartbroken and disappointed but knew it was the right decision. To risk it would have been foolish and irresponsible￼.  
Though I wanted more than anything to reach the summit, I was not willing to risk my life. This thru-hike, this year in fact, has been unforeseen in just about every way. It’s only right I should need a plan C for Katahdin. 
Once we finish the trail, the five of us have agreed to a reunion where we will again take on the beast and finally summit Katahdin. It’s a small silver lining knowing that we have reason to all be together once again.","Baxter State Park Maine

One ice cream cone, two snakes, three river fords. 
Tom dropped us off at Katahdin Spring Campsite. The group of us had gotten rooms for the night at The Baxter Park Inn. We were soaked and chilled to our bones after coming down off of Katahdin yesterday. It was predictable to rain all night and we wanted a night to dry out before starting South in the morning.
We hiked from Katahdin Spring Camp Sight through Baxter State Park and into the Hundred Mile Wilderness. 
Though the terrain could very well be some of the easiest we have hiked yet, today may have been my hardest day on trail so far. ￼My body is still tired and my muscles sore from my failed attempt at summiting Katahdin yesterday. I was also very dehydrated. I had had two beers and a shot size Fireball yesterday after coming off the mountain. They weren’t celebratory drinks, more of a necessity to help ease the pain of not making it to the summit. ￼I also had to say goodbye to Tom again, that was not easy. 
Maine is beautiful. The trail is so different than down south. More pine scent in the air, more roots and rocks. The trail followed the river for the first 9 miles, and three times today, the AT crossed the river. Fording the river was a fun experience. I put my crocs on to save my shoes and socks from getting wet and to help prevent blisters. 
We stopped for an ice cream cone at Abol Bridge Store. It was just what my exhausted body needed. I hoped it would help get me the 3.5 miles left to camp, though, I still struggled.
We got to camp later then usual. There are many more people here then on trail in the south. It was hard to find a spot to put up my tent. I’m sleeping on a slant tonight. Not ideal but I’m so tired I don’t think it’s going to matter.","Katahdin Steam Campground

We also hiked along the shores of Rainbow Lake. The lake is so quiet and peaceful. We saw not a soul, only a few feathered friends and heard the sound of the bullfrogs. ￼Maine is beautiful but the trail here in the 100 Mile Wilderness is tough on my feet, though there is little elevation, it’s hard to get any momentum going due to all the exposed tree roots and rocks that make up the trail. 
We arrived at camp about 4 pm. There is only one other hiker here tonight. We are all in our tents, he is hammocking. 
This may be my favorite camp to date. The shelter isn’t anything spectacular but it’s located right along side a large and flowing stream. The first thing I did when I got to camp, after setting up my tent, was to take a bath in the stream. It was wonderful. The cold water washed away all the days sweat and dirt.

Tonight we are camping on the shore of Nahmakanta Lake. It’s a beautiful spot with a sandy shore. There is even a picnic table.

Maybe it was because the trail followed a secluded lake￼￼. It definitely would be a place dad would have loved to fish. There were no people, only a few loons￼ in the water. I had tears in my eyes thinking how much of my life he has missed and how much I have missed him. Together we hiked for a few miles, then,  just like the lake, he too was gone. 
I am four days into the 100 Mile Wilderness and today I felt strong. It’s taken me a little while to transition back after the long car ride from Tennessee to Massachusetts, being home for two days, then the drive to Maine. ￼ 
After our failed attempt at Katahdin, I was mentally and physically struggling. Not today. 
There is so much water here. Streams, raging rivers, peaceful ponds and lakes. Untouched beauty.
Today the trail gave a little reprieve from all the roots. At one point, it became a wide path blanketed with pine needles. My feet felt as though I was walking on carpet. ￼The scent of pine filled the forest. It was a gift. I’m appreciating so many thing out here. Things I never knew I would.  It wasn’t long before the roots, rocks and muddy trail retuned but I’m going to remember and recall that pine path. 
I was hoping to see a moose today. There is so much evidence of them. Moose droppings cover the trail in many places and their tracks are everywhere. I’m certain￼ it’s only a matter of time before I witness the majestic creature. I look forward to that day. 
My tent is set up in a little oasis. It’s tucked in the tree line, along the shore of Jo Mary Lake. I have my own private water access and was again able to bathe all alone in the lake. It’s an amazing feeling to be so free out here.

I was able to move very quickly through the first four miles leading up to the drop due to the lack of food in my pack. Entering the 100 mile Wilderness, I carried enough food for the first 4.5 days and set up the food drop for the remaining days. It was a noticeable difference when my pack was filled with another 5 days of food. The remainder of my days miles went slower. 
We arrived at camp early today doing just under 8 miles. Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to is built just feet from a river with a rushing waterfall. The first thing I did when I arrived here was to climb out on the rocks and put my feet in the river. The cold water was so refreshing and rejuvenated my tired feet. 
Being at camp early affords an opportunity to have a campfire. Most nights we are just too tired to gather wood and make fire, tonight though, I enjoyed having one. The smell of campfire always brings me back to my childhood. Treasured memories indeed.

The view from White Cap was spectacular! I could see Katahdin in the distance and was amazed at how far we had hiked in just the 7 days we had been on trail heading south. We stopped on the summit, ate our breakfast and continued on. 
Starting early allowed us to get to camp early again. I took a nap on a large rock down by the brook. I really feel like I’m living in the woods now. It’s such a simple way of living out here. Though the days are hard on trail with the elevation gains and losses, my pack weight, the annoying bugs and the unpredictable weather on any given day, it has become a simple, peaceful life of only nature and necessity. 
I continue to be grateful for every day I have out here.

I like the early starts. The hiking seems easier. 
We forded Pleasent river today. The water, only up to my knees, wasn’t all that deep. I was told by some locals that at times, the water can be much higher. 
Chairback Mountain lived up to it’s reputation. It was a steep cliff of rocks. I had to put my poles away and use my hands to scramble over it. At the summit, the views were magnificent!
I hiked all day with Plantly and Meaugi.  Word came to us when we got limited cell service on top of Chairback, that Insight and Carebear had in fact, gotten off trail. What we assumed when they didn’t show up at camp last night, was confirmed.

All were large rock climbs and the rain made them slippery as hell!  There are few switchbacks ￼here in Maine, it’s nothing like hiking in the South. The mountains go straight up, roots and rocks make up the trail. The climbing is hard. Every step needs to be calculated. It’s slow. 
I had to dig really deep the last two miles to get to camp. It was knowing I had no choice but to continue to put one foot in front of the other, to keep pushing on.

We had 10.4 miles to get to ME 15, a shuttle would be picking us up and bringing us to The Shaw’s, there, we planned to zero for a day or two. Again the terrain was a continuous up and down rock climb.

My body is depleted. It’s hard to get the calories and nutrition needed when you’re in the woods for an extended time. When in town, I’m able to eat more protein and vegetables that I lack on trail. ￼
We arrived at The Shaw’s close to 5pm.   It’s a wonderful hostel run by Hippie Chick and her husband Poet. The atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. 
Dinner was cooked on a open wood fire pit. Melt in your mouth seasoned steaks, chicken burgers, campfire vegetables and apple cider slaw￼! It was delicious, nutritious and exactly what I needed! 
I was able to recharge all my electronics and call Tom and the kids. I missed hearing their voices for the last 5 days and was so happy to connect with them. 
It’s amazing how much we rely on our phones for everything. Living without was a lesson in living in the moment for me. Though I was disappointed I had no ability to take photos and videos to share, I was enjoying the peace of simply just being there, in the moment. Not trying to capture it, just enjoying it for what it is. I can’t remember a recent time I have not had a phone in my hand. I’ve been around long enough to have lived before cell phones were even a thing, now though it’s different feeling to be without for multiple days. 
My thoughts on the 100 mile wilderness: It’s beauty is spectacular. The water in Maine is abundant. Peaceful, quiet and secluded. Raw wilderness, natural and untouched in many ways. It’s also rugged and relentless with natures challenges.

I worked on sending videos and photos to Kel and updated my trail journal. It’s time consuming but town days are the only time I’m able to get caught up. I also made some phone calls to friends and family to let them know I’m still alive.

Yesterday’s experience with no water, the heat, the difficult climb and near heat exhaustion had really scared her.

We all enjoyed a beer and a few appetizers before having dinner. 
The atmosphere was a little lighter and we were all able to talk about yesterday. What we did, what we didn’t do, what we should have done etc, etc. 
Back at the Sterling Inn, Rob and I had planned to move forward together. We were planning out our days for our next stretch when Plantly and Meaugi said they had talked about it and decided to stay on trail and give it another go.

The four of us had breakfast at the Sterling Inn, then we were shuttled to the trail. We hiked about a half mile, where we took the Kennebec Ferry across the river. 
The “Ferry”, a canoe ride, takes each hiker, one by one across the river. It’s actually considered part of the AT and is the only way across.  The Kennebec is too large and deep to Ford. I enjoyed the experience. 
The trail ran all along the river for the entire few miles we hiked. There was an amazing waterfall with a swimming hole. Mudcrack took the opportunity to get in. The rest of us just sat and enjoyed the force of the rushing water and the energy of the falls.

For just $40 dollars you get a private cabin, towel, uses of the bathhouse and a home cooked breakfast with coffee. ￼The one room cabins are rustic, no electricity and there is no cell service. Lighting is by oil lamp and there is a wood stove for heat if needed. 
I sat on the porch of the main camp and watched the hummingbirds. Four feeders hung from the porch roof.  I have never seen so many hummingbirds in one place. They were so fascinating to watch. I couldn’t help but think of my mom and how much she would enjoy seeing them. I took pictures and video and I can’t wait to send them to her. She loves the hummingbirds like I do. 
Tim was so kind and made us dinner. He doesn’t typically serve dinner to hikers, only breakfast. We were so fortunate to eat such a hearty and homemade meal. Salad and corn chowder to start followed by hog shanks in a sweet barbecue sauce, venison steak and a side of tortellini. There wasn’t a bite left in anyone’s plate! 
Breakfast will be served 7am sharp tomorrow morning. I’m already looking forward to that!

The 10 miles today were easy after the huge breakfast I ate before leaving Harrisons. Tim makes a breakfast any hungry hiker would die for. A stack of twenty pancakes (yes twenty) with blueberries, strawberries and apples, scrambled eggs, three sausages, orange juice and coffee! 
We had a river ford within the first ten minutes of being on trail. We passed a few ponds, East Carry and West Carry. Other than that, the trail was pretty uneventful. 
Though we didn’t get on trail until 8am, we arrived at camp by 1:30. The terrain was pretty easy with virtually no elevation and we were able to move fairly quickly.  We considered going on a little further because it was so early in the day but with the tropical storm still being a possibility we decided to just make a fire and relax at the shelter. 
In an effort to cut some weight, I got a new backpack. It’s a ULA Circuit.  I have been using it for two days now,  the jury is still out. My Osprey pack I have had for about 6 or 7 years now, though I’ve loved it for how comfortable it is, it weighs 4+ pounds empty. The ULA is definitely lighter, though I’m not sure if it can compete with the comfortability of the Osprey. ￼ Change is hard sometimes, I will give it a fair chance, I can always go back to my Osprey if need be.","Harrison Pierce Pond Camp

The trail was nothing short of a river after the tropical storm dropped buckets of rain last night. I tried to rock and root hop in the hopes of keeping my feet somewhat dry but they were so slippery, I gave up within minutes and just started trudging through. 
The trail went along Flagship Lake. Plantly, Meaugi and I stopped for a snack and a break. I was in awe of all the driftwood that lined the small shore. I don’t think I have ever seen so much driftwood all in one place. Piles. I wanted  to take a piece of the smooth, beautiful wood, carrying it didn’t make sense so I left it were it was. 
The hike up to Little Bigelow Lean-To was nice. If it weren’t for the conditions of the wet and muddy trail, it would have been wonderful. 
There is side trail that crosses a large brook on the way to the shelter. Just in front of the shelter, the same brook flows through several cascading pools called The Tubs. 
We all went down to the tubs to soak our feet. The water was ice cold. Meaugi and Mudcrack got all the way in. For me, just my feet was enough. 
I’m in my tent tonight. Meaugi & Plantly in theirs, Mudcrack in his hammock. There are also three young men, Southbounders, staying at the Lean-To tonight. I’m sure we won’t see them again, all three are doing big miles every day.

Though I miss Tom, Rob, Kelly and all my family and friends, I know this is where I need to be. 
Plantly and Meaugi left camp about a half hour before me. They wanted to get an early start. We had a big day today. I finished my coffee and then hit the trail. Mudcrack was just getting up. He passed us all on trail even though he was the last to leave camp. 
I experienced the most amazing views today, but I had to work hard for them! It was a four Peak day.  Up and over Little Bigelow Mt., Avery Peak, Bigelow Mt. and Horn. Challenging climbs, but oh the pay off was epic!

We didn’t want to get caught coming down on slippery rocks. 
The Saddlebacks and the Bigelows have been my favorite thus far. The views on both are truly amazing. 
We experienced a bit of trail magic. A cooler left on the side of the trail as we came down Saddleback, filled with candy, coffee cakes, peanuts and more. It was a welcome treat. 
I fell today. Tripped on a root and went down on my hands and knees. (Dr. Rousseau, if you’re reading this, I’m fine, honestly) Though I will have a good bruise on my right knee and shin but no worse for the wear. It won’t be the last time I suspect.

Shower, laundromat, lunch, resupply then dinner is what most town days are made of. Today was no exception. The day unfolded in exactly that order. 
Lunch was a delicious steak and cheese bomb with hand cut fries followed by ice cream of course. Dinner a caesar salad with grilled chicken. We also ordered a large pizza with all the toppings, we will pack it out in the morning and have it for lunch on trail. I’m looking forward to that!

The climb up Old Blue was not so bad. I arrived at the summit just after 9 a.m. With rare cell phone service, I was able to send a few texts, I also received a call from my sister. It was nice to talk with her and catch up on things. 
When Plantly and Meaugi arrived shortly after, we all had lunch (yes at 9 a.m.) on the summit. I really enjoy the salmon packets with mayo. It’s a nice change from tuna, loaded with 29 grams of protein and it really gives me much needed energy. 
The hike down Old Blue was steep and treacherous. We went slow and calculated each step. The descent was 3 miles long and took us two and half hours. 
South Arm Road was our pickup location. We soaked our feet in the river while we waited for David from Pine Ellis to pick us up and shuttle us to the hostel. 
The usual routine of chores were performed and then off to the local market to get dinner. 
Another hamburger and fries followed by a pint of ice cream. 
Sadly, the small town of Andover is dying. The only business left is the small market. It carries minimal supplies but no fresh produce. There is a kitchen that serves pizza, hamburgers and sandwiches. You order inside and sit outside to eat. 
The town has a beautiful church but no pastor. The gas station is closed and all the other stores on the small Main Street are closed and the buildings for sale, as are many houses nearby the hostel. Sad really.

We hiked Moody and Wyman Mountain today. Neither had great views. 
I packed out a roast beef sandwich and a bag of potato chips. We were able to eat our lunch on a picnic table. It’s a rare commodity in Maine. Down south, every shelter has a table, in Maine, none do. We considered ourselves lucky to have such a luxury.

It was a small female. She darted into the woods, there was no opportunity to get a photo. I’m still holding out hope to see one in their natural habitat while I’m walking the trail. 
Baldpate East and Baldpate West were the two mountains we summited today. They were above tree line and had spectacular views. The descent was somewhat steep. A few times we had wooden and iron ladders to aid in getting down the rock slaps. There was also a section that we needed a rope. Again we took it slow and enjoyed the process.
I must say, I’ve really enjoyed these last two days of slack packing. There is such a noticeable difference in my ability to move up and down the mountains when wearing a day pack as opposed to my full backpack. 
Tomorrow I strap the monster on once again. I’ll be carrying four and a half days worth of food. It will be heavy! 
We are heading into a difficult section this week. The Moohusuc Notch! It’s said to be the most difficult mile on the entire AT. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little nervous. I’m told it takes some hikers 3 hours to get through that mile. The Notch is made up entirely of large boulders that must be climbed over, under and through. 
Weather is a concern. Forecast is showing rain Monday night. Coming down the Moohusuc Arm is not something I want to experience if the rocks are wet and slippery.  I’m praying that will not be the case. We will watch the weather closely and make safe choices.

We stopped for lunch at Speck Pond Shelter and I was super excited to see Hawk there! Hawk is a legend out here on trail. Last year, he did a Yo-yo (hike the trail from South to North turned around and hiked it back from North to South). This year apparently he is doing a flip flop. I had been following him on YouTube for over a year. It was pleasure to talk with him. He is as genuine in person as he appears on video! 
The day was only an 8.1 mile day but we hiked Spec Mountain, down the Moohusuc Arm and through the Moohusuc Notch. 
The Moohusuc Arm is said to be the steepest decent on the entire Appalachian Trail. The Moohusuc Notch is the hardest mile on the entire Appalachian Trail. They both lived up to their reputation! 
The arm was steep, made up of long rock slabs. I hung on to trees and roots to help aid in getting down. There were several places where butt scooting was my only option. 
We had plans to camp at a camp sight at the bottom of the arm. However, we reconsidered due to the fact that rain was predicted for late this evening into tomorrow morning, we knew we wouldn’t be able to go through the Notch if it was raining. Even if the rain had come over night, the rocks would be treacherous￼ and impassible. We decided to push on and get through the Notch, then find a stealth site for the evening. 
I found the Notch difficult. Some people call it fun. Not me. Maybe if I had taken it on first thing in the morning when my legs were fresh, maybe if we weren’t trying to get through before the dark of night came, maybe if it didn’t start lightly raining. Maybe, just maybe. 
The Notch is a mile long boulder scramble. Up, over and around a field of very large boulders, and on two occasions, through very tight rock caves where the only way through is to take your pack off and drag it behind you. It took us nearly three hours to maneuver through that one mile. 
My knees and shins took a beating. My whole body will feel it tomorrow. I believe my body bent in ways it has never before in it’s life. 
I’m grateful tonight for Plantly and Meaugi. We worked as a team today, I wouldn’t have wanted to go through that section of the trail alone. 
Today was hard. I’m learning I am very capable of doing hard things!

We left the shelter about 8 a.m. A late start for us. The plan was to hike 10.1 miles to Trident Cole Campsight. We were only on trail for a few minutes when we hit the Ledges. A steep outcropping of rock. Hands and feet bouldering. It was technical and very difficult. Plantly hurt her knee climbing up and was in pain, finding it difficult to continue walking. In addition, we got rain, making the trail slippery once again. 
She struggled to go the 5.3 miles to the nearest shelter and it took several hours before getting there. Her and Meaugi were done for the day. I was debating whether to push on the remaining 5 miles to the planned campsite when the rain came again. It poured buckets. My final decision was to stay at the shelter with them.

Where to begin? 
The plan was to leave Osgood Campsite by 7 a.m., hike up Mt Maddison, down to Maddison Hut and then on to a stealth campsite just below tree line. It should have been a 5.1 mile day. 
Out here, things often don’t go as planned. So much can be out of our control. The weather being one of them. 
Just as we reached tree line on Mt. Maddison, the sky darkened, black clouds rolled over, strong winds blowing. 
The trail above tree line is made up entirely of large boulders, with low visibility and 65MPH winds, it was very difficult and dangerous. I was thankful to be hiking with Mudcrack and Katie. Both are strong hikers and remained clam. We ultimately chose the bad weather bypass trail that would take us to Maddison Hut. 
The AMC high huts are not open to overnight guests this year due to COVID. They do however have a caretaker there, hikers have access to drinking water and bathrooms. Coffee, tea and hot cocoa along with a few baked goods are also available for purchase. 
We took the opportunity to get out of the wind, get a hot cup of coffee, fill our water bottles and check the weather report for the summit of Mt. Washington, that being our intended destination tomorrow. 
Temperatures over night were predicted to be 20° with a wind chill below Zero. In addition, the summit of Mt. Washington would be experiencing 80 to 90MPH winds tomorrow. We knew right there and then, tomorrows plan for going over Washington wasn’t going to happen. 
With the horrible overnight forecast and knowing Washington wasn’t an option for tomorrow, we made the decision to hike back down to Pinkham Notch where we had come from a day earlier. 
With no chance of going back over Maddison and down the way we came, we mapped out several other trails that would ultimately get us back to Pinkham Notch where Katie’s rental car was parked. 
The hike down took several hours. With pouring rain, trail above tree line, fog making it difficult to see and lots of bouldering on slippery rock, it was slow going, requiring both hands and feet. 
I was soaked, tired and honestly miserable. It was hard. 
At some point coming down, while using my hands to push myself up and over a boulder, I felt a ping in my left hand. My thumb immediately swelled at the joint.
Several hours later, we came out where the trail crosses the Mt. Washington auto road. At this point, 2 miles of trail remained to get to Pinkham Notch and ultimately Katie’s car. It was late in the day and we were trying to beat the dark, I was exhausted and moving very slow. 
After a quick discussion, it was decided, Mudcrack would leave his pack with Katie and I, giving him the ability to move much quicker down the trail. He would get to the car and drive down the street and up the auto road to pick up Katie and I. Katie and I would take the packs and begin walking down the road. We mentioned we might try to hitch a ride down if the opportunity presented itself. At that point, Mudcrack took off down the trail, Katie and I down the auto road. 
About twenty minutes into our hike down the road, we were picked up by a man and his wife coming down the road. He had a pickup truck with two young kids in the back seat of the cab, we jump in the bed of the truck. 
He was kind enough to drive us down and then offered to drive us to Pinkham Notch. Thinking we would get there before Mudcrack could get down and to the car, we took him up on his offer. Wrong decision. In hindsight, we should have just waited at the bottom of the auto road. 
We arrived at the Notch, soaked, exhausted, sore and hungry just before dark.  The car,  gone. Mudcrack had made it down the trail before us and was on his way to pick us up at the auto road. 
We later learned, we had missed each other by seconds. 
No cell service in the Notch left us unable to reach him. 
He had arrived at the gate to the auto road. Being late and after hours, the gate was closed. After explaining the situation to the guy manning the gate and trying everything to persuade him to let him drive up was unsuccessful, Mudcrack parked the car and ran the 2 miles up the road only to realize we must have gotten a ride down. 
Showing up back Pinkham Notch completely wiped out from the added four mile run, up and down the auto road, an hour and a half after we had arrived where Katie and I were able to book bunk rooms for the night at the Joe Dodge Lodge located right there at the Notch.
After a hot shower, I made a cup of soup then iced my hand before crawling into my bunk.

Roni arrived at Joe Dodge Lodge an hour after I phoned (a 55 minute drive) and took me back to her house in Plymouth NH. 
We had a nice lunch downtown. The food was delicious but more than anything, I enjoyed just sitting with my friend, talking, relaxing and not being on trail.
By now, my thumb and hand had swelled up pretty badly. Unable to put any pressure on it without pain, I sent a text and a few photos to my doctor, Dr. Rousseau. She was concerned it could be fractured, I could have partially torn a tendon￼￼ or simply, have a bad sprain. 
A visit to the Urgent Care confirmed it was not fractured though badly sprained. I was put in a split and sent on my way to ice and elevate. 
Roni, being the kind friend that she is, took me to the natural food store where I got arnica and CBD ointment. Back at her house, I iced and elevated. 
The day ended with freshly laundered hiking clothes and a ice cream sundae for dinner! 
I’m staying the night here, in a most comfortable bed, Roni will drive me back to the trail where I will meet Mudcrack and Katie. The plan is to hike up the Amanoosic ￼Ravine Trail to Lake of the Clouds Hut where ￼we will then be back on the AT.

I said goodbye to her,  knowing I had only a day and a half of hiking before she would pick us up once again at Crawford Notch when we finally finished the Presidentials. 
Mudcrack, Katie and I were reunited, the three of us began our treck up the Amanoosic Ravine Trail that would take us to the Lake of the Clouds Hut. 
Truthfully, I didn’t want to be out there. My hand was sore and after Tuesday’s  Mt. Maddison nightmare, I had in fact, lost the joy. There is a saying out here on the trail: “Never quit on a bad day.”
Though the thought was fleeting, it was real. I expected at some point along this journey, it would be. 
The day, amazingly, turned out to be incredible. The hike up the ravine to the Hut was steep but beautiful. It took a bit to get use to hiking with one pole due to my injured left hand but the sun was shining and the sky was blue. It made all the difference in the world. 
We reached the Hut about two and a half hours into our day. It was windy on top but clear as far as the eye could see. We enjoyed a hot cup of coffee and a brownie, the majestic Mt. Washington sitting right in front of us. With not a cloud in the sky, we could see her total beauty. 
Moving on, we hiked over Mt. Monroe then Little Monroe￼ at which point we said goodbye to Katie. She would be hiking back down to her car and catching her flight back home to Colorado tomorrow. ￼I was sad to see her go. She has a kind and generous soul and I really enjoyed her company. 
Mudcrack and I continued on over the Presidentials. The views were spectacular and the day just kept getting better. Such a stark contrast to just two days prior. 
We reached Mizpah Hut after a wonderful day on the ridge and celebrated with a cup of hot cocoa, then hiked over to Nauman Campsite where we are camping tonight.

4 hours later, Russ and Roni picked Mudcrack and I up at the Notch on route 302.
On the way back to their house, Russ suggested we stop at the Mt. Washington Hotel. It was so enjoyable to sit outside and have lunch that included an adult beverage, while we looking up at the mountains we had climbed over the last few days. It gave us a whole different perspective. 
Later, after we were each showered and settled into our rooms, Roni took us for a ride, showing Mudcrack and I, the charming little town of Plymouth. We stopped at a local farm stand, fresh picked corn on the cob, squash and tomatoes were picked to be an addition to the grilled steak and chicken dinner Roni had prepared for us. 
Dinner was magnificent! One of the best dinners I have eaten since being on trail!

She drove Mudcrack and I to the trail head, I was like a young kid going off to school, not wanting to get on the bus and leave the security and comforts of home. Roni, teasingly, telling me it’s going to be okay. Go, she said, “you’ll be fine, it’s going to be a great day and you’ll make lots of friends.” Reluctantly, I said goodbye and up the trail I headed. 
Mudcrack and I had mapped out a 3-day plan that would take us over Franconia Ridge from Rt 302 Crawford Notch to Rt 93 Franconia Notch. Approximately a 28 mile stretch.  Roni would once again pick us up at the trail head when we came down.  
The trail going up the Notch was easier than anticipated, we found ourselves making more miles than expected. Reaching our targeted destination before noon, we decided to push on. 
The weather was not the sunny day that was forecasted. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Cloudy, foggy and very windy. 
We reached Zeland Hut and stopped for a cup of hot cocoa, then proceeded the 2.5 miles up to the Summit of Mt. Zeland where I reached my 700 mile mark.  
Though excited to have reached the milestone, I was struggling mentally.  Doubting myself. My capabilities. We pressed on...
Guyot Mountain came next. The summit above tree line. With the wind raging, I was scared to go up and over the summit and ultimately to Guyot Shelter where we could camp for the night. Visions of the day on Mt. Maddison ￼played over and over in my mind. 
Just a quarter mile from the summit, we set up camp. The stealth spot was not ideal by any means but I reasoned it was better to stay there for the night than risk the wind on top.
The wind is raging! ￼￼My tent blowing relentlessly, making it difficult to sleep. ￼￼I’m freezing. I have every article of clothing I owned on me in an effort to keep warm.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630366,"I lied in my tent most of the night thinking of the fastest and easiest way down of the mountain. My mind was telling me I wanted out. I was done. The joy was gone. I questioned again, why I was there.  
The wind was still blowing when morning came, though not as severely. At first light, I packed up my tent. I had gotten very little sleep. Mudcrack and I had made a plan to break camp at first light, skip coffee and breakfast, hike the 3 miles to Galehead Hut where we would then make our breakfast, get coffee and use the bathrooms. 
I wanted to bail on that plan. On the trail. Hike down the mountain like I had played it all out in my head, get off trail, call Roni to come get me. 
I didn’t. 
We left camp at 6:30 a.m. and hiked the .4 miles to the summit of Guyot. Though still windy and foggy, the summit was not threatening. We took a minute on top then followed the trail to the right. Now faced with an immediate field of boulders I stood there, defeated. Mudcrack was in front of me, making his way across the rocks, he looked back at me, frozen where I stood. 
The words came out...”I don’t think I can do this.” His reply: “Yes you can, I’ve seen you do way harder stuff than this.” 
I wasn’t convinced but continued forward. 
We arrived at the Hut by 9 a.m. only to find it closed. Apparently they don’t open until 11 a.m. midweek. We sat on the bench on the porch and made coffee and breakfast. The weather was improving slowly but my attitude still was not. 
The weather report posted to window at the Hut said that today would become mostly sunny skies and winds would diminish to 10 to 15MPH. Tomorrow, mostly cloudy sky’s, winds 15 to 30MPH. 
Because of the extra miles yesterday, we had only 3 miles to get to the shelter where we had originally planned on staying. Taking into consideration the weather and the fact that it was early in the day, we decided to push ourselves and go up and over the ridge. We wanted to hike it on a clear day and today looked ideal. Tomorrow’s weather was not predicted to be as nice. 
Hiking up and down Mt.Garfield before starting up Mt. Lafayette and ultimately over Franconia Ridge which included summiting Mount Lafayette, Little Haystack Mt, Lincoln Mt. and Liberty Mt. before taking the trail down to Liberty Springs tent sight.  An epic undertaking after already hiking 9 miles. The promise of sunny skies had me motivated to push. I wanted the Ridge to be a good experience. 
It turned out to be amazing! Spectacular in fact. I found strength beyond what I thought I was capable of. The views energize me and propelled me up and over. I basked in the sun, in all of nature’s incredible beauty. Mountain beyond mountain reaching the horizon.  It was glorious, and I, a different person from the one lying in that tent the night before. 
If you could hand pick the perfect day to hike the ridge, it was today!
With cell service, I called Roni from the top of Lafayette and told her we were ahead of schedule. That we were on the ridge a day early and planned to camp at Liberty Springs, leaving us on 3 miles to hike out tomorrow. 
Ultimately, we decided to really push and hike all the way out to the road. Roni was willing to pick us up a day earlier than planned and it would allow us to have a zero day given we were a day ahead of schedule. 
We knew it would be dark before we would make it out of the woods. The last hour was hiked in the dark by way of headlamps. It was slow going. Not only because of the rocky trail engulfed in darkness,  but my legs were tired. 
We reached the road where Roni was waiting for us, at 9:30 p.m. In true Roni fashion, she had water, soda, beer and snacks for us to enjoy on the ride to her house, where she had dinner waiting in the oven for us! 
An epic 17 mile day over some of the hardest terrain on the entire AT!

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630423,"Today started great but ended very badly. 
Mudcrack and I had planned a 16 mile day over the Kinsmans. The plan was to slack pack the miles and return to Roni’s house in Plymouth where we would spend the night. The next day, we would slack pack a 14 mile day over Mt. Moosalukie returning once again to Roni’s house. Then, the following day, he and I would say goodbye to Roni for the final time, return to the trail with our full packs, heading towards the border of Vermont. 
I was overjoyed when Russ and Roni wanted to join us on trail for the day. We  were up before daylight and dropped a car at the location we planned to end the day, Beaver Brook Parking Lot on Rt 12, then drove to the trailhead at Liberty Springs. This allowed us as many hours of daylight as possible to hike the 16 miles. ￼
The weather report showed a 10 to 40% chance of rain, only a total of a half-inch for the day. We figured the odds were in our favor, though we packed our rain gear of course.
The morning started great. Roni and I were together on trail. I was so glad to have my girlfriend with me, for her to share a part of my AT journey. Feeling great with only a day pack to carry, I was able to move effortlessly. I’m always appreciative ￼of a day I don’t have to carry the weight of my full pack. 
We reached Lonsome Lake Hut by 9 a.m. The hut was closed. So we stopped for a snack on the dock by the lake, and that’s when the rain began. Misty, really, at first, eventually turning increasingly heavier. 
Up to the peak of North ￼Kinsman we climbed. Reaching the summit, then down and up South Kinsmen peak. The descent was steep and rocky. Moving at a decent pace even with the rain, we reached the shelter at about 1:15 p.m. Stopped to filter some water, use the privy and have a bite to eat.
It’s easy to get cold when your wet from the rain and you stop moving, we quickly put some food in us, more for energy than enjoyment, and moved on. 
Roni began to feel pain in her knee that grew increasingly worse as the miles went on. Between the wet, slippery trail and the pain she was experiencing, we were now moving at a snails pace. Then, it got to the point that she could barely walk at all.
With 4.5 miles still to go before we would reach the parking lot and darkness only a few hours away, we had no choose but to call for help. Roni was no longer able to walk out on her own. The pain unbearable. 
Worried for and feeling helpless in the moment, I sent an SOS from my Garmin InReach, within minutes I was on the phone with the New Hampshire Game Warden. After answering several questions about our situation, he assembled a rescue team. 
It took the team of 17 volunteers an hour-and-a-half to hike in and meet us on the trail. A team member assessed her leg and made an educated guess that she may have torn her meniscus. ￼￼Still raining and now well beyond dark, they strapped Roni into the litter (similar to a gurney) and began carrying her out. 
It was incredible to see such an operation. The whole team worked liked a fine oiled machine. 7 or 8 rescuers￼carrying at a time, then switching off. ￼When there was steep and challenging areas, they would line up on the trail and pass the litter down the line. Truly amazing what these men and women have to do to get someone who is injured out of such a remote location. 
My appreciation for these highly trained volunteers, immense!￼ 
It took 3 hours for them to carry her out. 11 o’clock at night, soaked, cold, mentally and by now physically drained,  we were safely at the car.

The trail up was definitely steep. Manageable yes, in good weather, I would not ever attempt it if it was wet!￼  
The day promised to be sunny but the fog had not lifted by the time we summited. It was windy and viewless when we first arrived. Shortly after the sky started to clear, we stopped for a snack break and enjoyed the views.

I am blessed beyond words to have Roni as a friend. I’m not sure she even realizes the magnitude of all she has done. 
Though yesterday we hiked our last 4000 footer, NH is still not in the rear view mirror￼. 
We will be leaving the hardest states behind soon but today we still had two peaks to climb. Mt. Cube followed by Mt. Smarts. Both nearly 3000 feet. 
The idea that I’ve done the most difficult and technical parts of the trail feels good to me. I’m proud of that accomplishment. 
The views from Cube were spectacular!     I also had a delightful surprise as I was coming down the mountain. Fly by Night, a guy I had met and camped with my very first night on trail, back in March, on Springer Mt. was coming up the trail. We recognized each other and stopped to chat a minute. He had stayed on trail, with some jumping around and a five week hiatuses due to a fractured foot, he is continuing North as he had originally ￼planned.  ￼
I’m finding one of the positives of my flip flop, is the opportunity to see again, some of the people I met who remained on trail, when I first started back in Georgia. It really is special. 
Next came Mt. Smarts. It was a 3.5 decent, a long but gradual up. The summit wooded, on top a fire-tower. I climbed to top to take in the views. 360! Wow is all I can say. 
After nearly 18 miles, we were picked up by Doug. He is the Inn Keeper at Dowds Country Inn. It’s the charming place we are staying tonight in the town of Lime NH. 
Tom drove the 2 hours up to spend the night. I love that he’s here, though the truth is, I have an overwhelming feeling of just getting in his truck and going home with him. It sure would be easy. The thought of being home, safe and surrounded by people who love me.

Mudcrack and I hit the trail at noon. I struggled with the weight of my full pack after having the pleasure of slack packing the last 3 days. I will need to get back in the groove with my old 30-pound friend!
I also wore a new pair of trail runners today. My feet have been swollen and I needed to get a half-size lager. Several of my toenails have turned black and are tender from all the downhill pressure. I’m hoping the larger size will alleviate it. ￼We had Holts Ledges and Moose Mountain to climb. Neither were terribly challenging, but I struggled nonetheless. Some days are just more difficult. 
I’m also back in my tent tonight after four nights of sleeping in a bed at Roni’s house. We are camped by Mink Brook. It’s not an official campsite but there are a few other hikers camping here also.

The trail runs right out of the woods into Dartmouth College. Walks right by the athletic fields and down the Main Street of Hanover where all the shops and restaurants are.
I was supposed to meet my friend, Neil, he works at the college, for lunch. I promised I’d stop when passing through. Unfortunately, today is the holiday, Labor Day. The campus is closed, he has the day off. Sadly, I will not get to see him.

After lunch and resupplying, we followed the AT through town, over the Connecticut River where we crossed into Vermont, leaving New Hampshire behind. 
I’m happy to have Maine and New Hampshire behind me. They are considered the two most difficult states on the entire trail.
New Hampshire was tough! The weather can make or break those mountains. There were days I struggled. There were days that were amazing. I was tested and I came through the other side. 
I have to thank Mudcrack for sticking with me. He has more confidence in my ability than do I. He has gently pushed me past what I believed I was capable of, I’ve come through stronger. I am and will be, forever grateful.

Mudcrack rented an E-Bike from the hostel where we are staying and rode back into Hanover for dinner. I declined his offer to go along, wanting to just put my feet up and rest.

Mudcrack and I made arrangements with the hostel to slack pack today. The idea was to make some big miles so we could catch up with Plantly and Meaugi who are about a week ahead of us. They had taken a few weeks off trail after finishing Maine, skipped the state of New Hampshire and got back on trail in Vermont. 
I am really hoping to reunite with them. Mudcrack has been so kind to hike through the Whites with me, in truth, he can move much faster. He is younger and a much stronger hiker than I. 
I have been feeling like his ball and chain and trying hard to put in the big miles and I have over the last few days, but I can’t maintain 19 and 20 miles a day. 
I have no enjoyment on trail when I push those miles. I don’t want to stop to take photos or videos or even take a bathroom break because I will fall far behind him. No fun, no joy. 
I have to be honest with myself. It’s not fair to Mudcrack. I know he needs to go. Move ahead at his pace. Me at mine.

NEVER QUIT ON A BAD DAY. 
I’m not 100% sure but I have to believe, for most of us, the thought has, at some point along this journey, crossed every Thru-hikers mind. 
Yesterday was a bad day. I was feeling really guilty of holding Mudcrack back. Feeling the pressure of making big miles or be left hiking out here alone.
Last night, back at the hostel, we talked about it over a cold beer. Mudcrack saying, he knew we wouldn’t hike together forever but wanted to stay with me until I caught up with Plantly and Meaugi again. He is a very kind, young man. 
My day was much better today. Though we still did decent miles, 15.9, I went at my pace. Not trying to keep up. I wasn’t far behind and Mudcrack waited for me at various locations along the trail. ￼
I had downloaded some music on my phone back when I was staying a few days in Gorham, today was the first day I listened to music on trail. It really helped me stay out of my own head and gave me a little push up the mountains. I found it very enjoyable. I will need to add more songs, I think I’m going to be singing up and down the trail more often. 
At the end of our day, with just a half a mile up to the shelter, we unexpectedly, received trail magic. Kevin & Keith, as they introduced themselves, were all set up by the brook. They invited Mudcrack and I over, offered up cold soda, sandwiches with fresh garden tomatoes, chips, Mac salad, bananas and cookies. 
As we happily devoured our meal, we chatted with the brothers. They live in Vermont, about an hour away, come to this area a few times a year to offer trail magic. I felt blessed we were here at the right time and grateful for their generosity.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630613,"I didn’t sleep well last night. I think it may have been due to the Coke I had at trail magic. Nevertheless, I was up before sunrise and on trail by 7 a.m.
The trail started straight up! Vermont mountains are not technical like New Hampshire, though they are still challenging. ￼Many rolling ups and downs. 
Today, the Appalachian Trail walked through Gifford Woods State Park, a large, car-accessible campground. Hikers can get a 50 cent shower, use the restrooms, fill water bottles at the spigot ￼and charge electronics. It’s definitely a treat! Many simple things I’ve taken for granted each day at home, have become luxuries out here. I now view them as gifts.￼
The Long Trail picks up the AT at the State Park also. The Long Trail runs 273 miles through the state of Vermont. It runs along the main ridge of the Green Mountains, coinciding with the Appalachian Trail for about 100 miles. With the addition of The Long Trail, I imagine ￼we will be seeing more hikers. 
Mudcrack and I took a half-mile blue blaze trail down to The Inn at Long Trail. They have an Irish Pub located inside the Inn where we were able to buy lunch. 
I ordered a ice cold lemonade, large garden salad, a cheese burger and apple crisp with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream! It was worth the extra half-mile and gave me the energy I needed to climb Mt. Killington! Killington was my last 4,000 footer on trail. I’m camping tonight at Cooper Lodge Shelter, though I chose to sleep in my tent instead of the shelter. 
Cooper Lodge is the highest trail shelter on the AT in Vermont, sitting just near the peak of Killington. It is one of the oldest shelters on trail and is in pretty poor condition.","Stony Brook Shelter

Last night, we camped along the banks of Bully Brook. First thing this morning, the trail crossed the brook and went straight up. 
A mile or so in, once the sun rose above the trees, we stopped and made coffee and ate breakfast.
It was pretty cool and a nice surprise this morning to see the enchanted rock garden, two actually. Several piles of white rocks all stacked up. It looked mystical, as if fairies or gnomes￼ lived amongst the rocks, were my thoughts. I smiled and hiked on. 
I am seeing quite a few Long Trail hikers. It’s been nice to stop and chat with them. I enjoy seeing more people on trail. Many have been interested in my AT journey and are full of questions. Multiple times a day, I tell my story.

The day kept getting better. We hiked 1.4 miles down the mountain and another 2 miles up to the summit of Bromley Mt. where we sat on the ski lift platform, made breakfast and enjoyed the view. As amazing as my morning was, the day got even better.
Danielle, my dear friend and next door neighbor, just happened to text me that she was on an annual cousin’s weekend in Vermont this year instead of their traditional￼ NH beach weekend. After exchanging a few texts, we discovered she was 20 minutes away from Manchester Center, the town I would be in late morning. At 11 a.m., she pulled into The Pinnacle Lodge and scooped up Mudcrack and I, took us out for a delicious lunch, then drove us into town so we could Resupply for the next four days. 
It was such an unexpected blessing in my day! I loved our visit. I’ve missed my friend, seeing her was wonderful. 
Back at the Lodge, I showered, did laundry, talked to Kelly and tried to catch up on my journals, etc.

My pack felt incredibly heavy with four full days worth of food in it. Though the terrain was a gentle and steady up, I was slow under the heavy weight of my pack. One would think by now I would be used to it, but a full food bag adds an extra 10ish pounds. A very noticeable difference especially when climbing up. 
The heavy pack aside, today the trail graced me with an amazing gift. I was brought together with Stoneman and Aura, two of my original trail family members, when I started this journey back in Georgia. They just happened to be hiking the Long Trail going North and today, the trail gods allowed our paths to cross. It was truly amazing to see them both again. I hugged them with tears in my eyes. We all couldn’t believe our luck. The trail had brought us together again, even if it was, only for a few fleeting moments. 
I arrived at the Stratton Pond Shelter about a half-hour after Mudcrack. Ten miles done, about 8 more to go. I needed fuel so I had a quick lunch and hit the trail again. 
The climb up to Stratton Mt. was slow. I was tired, my legs felt heavy. Finally reaching the summit where Mudcrack was waiting. 
The summit, though wooded, had a fire-tower. I had not the energy or desire to climb it to see the view. 
I crossed 900 miles today. It’s crazy when I think about it. I’m almost at the half way point. 
We hiked for a few more miles then found a place to stealth camp. Mudcrack made a fire, the nights are getting cold. We chatted and reminisced about our time on trail together, knowing that our time of hiking together would be coming to end. 
Tomorrow, we reunite with Plantly and Meaugi. I will continue on with them. Mudcrack will be pushing ahead. We have been an unlikely pair. He is twenty years younger and a faster and stronger hiker, but he has upped my game and shown me just how capable I am. These last few weeks I have been hiking big miles I never dreamed I’d be capable of. 
At the end of the day, I’m proud of myself but I can’t continue at this pace. It’s time to slow back down, for me, there is more to hiking then just hiking.￼","The Pinnacle Lodge Manchester Center VT

I keep my hiking clothes in the bottom of my sleeping bag, my body heat keeps them warm at night, making it easier to get dressed when I don’t have to put on cold clothes in the morning. 
I’ve gotten my morning routine down to a science now. Everything has a specific place in my pack, I have an order as to how I put everything in. It’s simple really.  I’m amazed at how little I really need to live out here. Just the necessities. Nothing more.
I crossed the border into Massachusetts today. It has taken me 2 months and a day from the time I climbed Katahdin in Maine and started my Flip Flop hike back south, to walk to my home state. It feels great to be in Massachusetts! I now have completed Georgia, North Carolina, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. Closing in on 1,000 miles.

I feel very fortunate to have such a wonderful husband who is so supportive of my epic endeavor. He truly is the best. I appreciate all he does for me and realize how lucky I am.
We dined on a picnic table in the sun, then Tom took us to the Dollar General so we could Resupply for the next 4 days. 
We were back on trail with 9 more miles to hike; that would take us into Dalton. Dalton is another town that the trail walks right through the main streets of town.

Last Wednesday, Plantly, Meaugi and I were finally reunited with Insight and Carebear. I was very excited, happy to have our trail family back together again. It had been since July, way back in the Hundred Mile Wilderness that we had to leave Insight and Carebear behind. 
After Insight’s kidney stone surgery, they continued to plug along the trail from where they had gotten off, leaving them weeks behind Plantly, Meaugi and I.
So late in September, it was too cold and dangerous in the White Mountains. They found themselves mostly alone on trail and with the weather being unpredictable in those mountains, they decided to jump up to Massachusetts and continue their hike, going forward with us. 
All of us were seeing fewer and fewer people on trail. Our thoughts were that it would be nice to have more people around; safety in numbers. The year of COVID has been a challenging year in many, many ways! 
The five of us set out Thursday morning from Great Barrington, MA with plans to do a 4-day stretch that would take us into Kent, Connecticut. 
Four miles into the day, Insight and Carebear called for a shuttle and went back to the Travel Lodge in Great Barrington. 
Their packs were too heavy due to all the now-unnecessary winter gear they had been carrying from The Whites. They were struggling to keep up and decided to get off, go back, swap out some gear and rejoin us in a few days when we got to Kent, CT. 
Plantly, Meaugi and I continued on as planned.
Kent is charming, little town, though more of a tourist town than a hiker-friendly town. By that I mean, lodging is more expensive, re-supply more expensive etc, etc. 
Again, due to the after affects of COVID, some of the hostels, restaurants and shops are now, sadly, permanently closed, adding an extra layer of difficulty. 
We all made the decision to get a shuttle back to Great Barrington on Sunday (when Plantly, Meaugi and I finished our stretch) reserving rooms at the Travelodge, once again, where it was more affordable.
Insight and Carebear were there and rain was predicted for Monday and Tuesday. I hadn’t had a zero since NH, and we all agreed it would be a good time, with the rain coming, to take a day off. 
Because of logistics, we would not be able to get a ride back to the trail until Wednesday morning; that would mean taking a double zero. A double zero is not something we typically like to do, for many reasons. I find it harder to get back on trail the more time off, financially it can get expensive due to lodging and eating in town, etc. 
One day to rest the body is good, more than that, for me, not necessary.  But with the weather coming in and the shuttle not available until Wednesday morning, the plan was to hike into Kent, CT on Sunday, Tom would pick Plantly, Meaugi and I up, drive us an hour back to Great Barrington where we would double zero, the five of us would then get back on trail Wednesday morning in  Kent where we got off and proceed forward all together. 
Sunday morning, a few hours into our hike into Kent, Plantly and Meaugi told me that they decided to stay on trail. They weren’t going to go back to Great Barrington as planned and would just keep hiking- saying it was too stressful with five of us in the mix now. They had concerns about everyone’s hiking style and didn’t think it was going to work with what they were comfortable with. 
Truthfully, I was shocked. There was no communication that they were considering an alternative plan, I was told matter of factly, hours before our planned pickup. 
Out here, on trail, there is a saying: hike your own hike. It’s true, one must do what works for them and though I understand that, I felt a little disappointed that there was no communication from them, in advance, that they were even considering a different plan. Mudcrack and I had pushed so hard, through The Whites and into Vermont, so I could catch them, and hike with them again, after they had gotten off trail, skipped NH and got back on in Vermont. 
My feelings were that of sadness mixed with anger if I’m being honest. Again, it’s nobody’s job to babysit another hiker out here, but when you are a Trail family, I believe, you make decisions together. 
I’m a solo hiker, I enjoy hiking with people, it’s part of why I’m out here. I want to share the experience with others, not be alone in the woods. 
After hearing the news from them, I pushed ahead, hoping to get to the pickup location earlier than originally planned so I would have more time with Tom and Rob. They were making the 2.5 hour drive to pick us up and bring some supplies. Now, without Plantly and Meaugi getting off, I knew I could move much faster, allowing me more time with my family. 
I called Tom and asked if he could come earlier than planned. In the end, I got to the pickup location but had to wait for over an hour for Tom and Rob to arrive.  By the time they got there, Plantly and Meaugi were just coming out of the woods.  We drove them the 4 miles into town of Kent to the Grocery store where they intended to re-supply and get back on trail, however, when we got there, the only grocery store in town , had closed at 3 p.m. due to a company party. 
We drove them, dropped them off at the gas station and I said goodbye. 
Not sure I will see them again. 
Tom, Rob and I then drove the hour back to the Travel Lodge, as was the original plan, where I quickly showered off the last four day’s sweat, dirt and grime.  After, the three of us enjoyed dinner together at a delicious authentic Mexican restaurant just down the street from the motel. Two margaritas and overstuffed burrito, helped ease the pain of my 14 mile day and all mental angst. 
It was July when I last seen my boy and I was so happy he made the trip out with Tom to see me. I miss my family. I’m blessed that they support my dream of hiking the trail, I’m happy to be out here living that dream, though there are many days, I miss them terribly and my familiar life as wife and mother. 
I write this while sitting in my room at the Travel Lodge. Many thoughts go through my mind. It’s hard to put them all on paper. I wish I could express myself in a fluid, meaningful way. Sometimes, it takes all I have in me to journal at the end of the day. I promised myself, I would at the very least, put something on paper every day that I am out here. There is so much I want to remember about this journey. I know I will want to relive it, to who knows, maybe share it with my future grandchildren someday. At the very least, keep the memories alive and close to my heart. All the good, bad and the ugly. All of it!

Insight and Carebear joined us in my room and we shared stories of the trail and the girls brought me up to date on what has been going on back home. 
Later, they treated us (Insight, Carebear & I) to lunch at the Mediterranean restaurant across the street from the motel then later drove me to the store so I could pick up a few last minute supplies. ￼

The ground was wet, the fall leaves covered the trail making it slippery. I walked cautiously but still managed to slip. Luckily no harm done. 
I inhaled a cleansing breath of forest air.  It seems the woods have a distinct smell after the rain. Earthy. I could smell the soil, the ground, the fallen leaves.
Though it’s never fun hiking in the rain, we definitely need it. Most of the streams, brooks and rivers have dried up due to the lack of rain this summer. We had no problem getting water on trail today. We’ll see how tomorrow goes. 
I walked along Ten Mile River. The water was flowing rapidly. It was a beautiful stretch of trail, the river lined with fall colors.

We had a short day today, only 9 miles but the first 4 miles were slow going. The rain, coupled by the rocks covered with wet leaves, made the trail slippery. 
We reached the Morgan Stewart Shelter about 11:30 a.m. and stopped to make another cup of hot coffee. 
The rain eventually ended, the sky cleared and the sun shined. It was a mood lifter and made us all happy. 
Our destination today was The Mountain Top Deli and Market. They are located in Stormville, NY, just a half-mile from the trail, and allow hikers to camp behind their deli. They also allow us to use their electrical outlet and water spigot.  
We reached the Deli about 2 p.m., ordered delicious sandwiches and made quick work of devouring them before setting up our tents in back of the building. 
All settled in, we enjoyed the afternoon sitting in the sun, sharing a beer and just relaxing. ￼
The luxury of just waking around the building and having access to anything I am craving is a great feeling and makes for a wonderful day on trail.

The terrain became a little more rocky and rugged. The trail had many blown downs,  creating a lot of obstacles. Most had to be bush whacked around. I found the fourteen miles to be pretty monotonous. ￼￼
The highlight of the day was camping at the Franciscan￼￼ Graymoor Spiritual Center. We set our tents up in the baseball field, which has been open to hikers for camping since the early 1970s. There is a pavilion at the edge of the field with benches, picnic tables, a spigot and a shower stall.
After getting set up, Insight and I walked the mile down to the Appalachian Deli & Grill, where we were able to order hot sub sandwiches, fries and onion rings. 
Carebear stayed behind to keep an eye on our packs and gear. 
Another mile back, we arrived with dinner, to find Carebear talking with Brian, a local trail angel who was making the rounds, checking known areas where hikers stay, offing rides or anything he could do to help. 
Brian is a generous man who enjoys helping the hiking community and spends many days doing trail magic. We chatted for a while, then he drove back to the Deli after it was discovered that part of Insight’s and Carebear’s dinner order was never put in the bag.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631272,"We left the Bear Mountain Motel this morning and were back on trail shortly after 7:30 AM. I was looking forward to walking through the The Trailside Zoo. 
This is the description from my trial guide app: The AT enters the Trailside Zoo and Museum, one of the more peculiar sights along the entire trail. The trail walks through the zoo for about a quarter mile, showcasing a variety of local wildlife (those in the zoo are mostly injured or rehabilitating). There is also a natural history museum that hikers can enter. The zoo is open from 10 AM to 4 PM daily, so if you happen to cross while it is closed, you'll need to take a blue-blazed side trail around the zoo.
The Trailside Zoo also holds the distinction of being the lowest elevation on the entire Appalachian Trail at 160 feet above sea level. 
Sadly, we were there much earlier then 10 a.m. and did not get to walk through the zoo. I was disappointed. I’m sure it would have been a highlight for me. 
￼I did, however, really enjoy Bear Mountain State Park. I’ve been told it can be a very popular place, especially this time of year with tourists coming to see the fall leaves. Being a Tuesday morning at 8 a.m., we had the place to ourselves. There was a man quietly fishing on the shore and another man out for an early morning walk, beside the two of them, we were alone. 
The morning fog was still hanging low in the valley as we walked past the Lodge, then followed the trail along the pond. Several turkey vultures sat on picnic tables quietly watching us. It almost seemed as if they were guarding the entrance to the mountain. 
Though you need some degree of physical fitness to be able to endure the thousands of stone stairs that make up the trail, the hike up to the summit of Bear Mountain is well defined and well grated. There is also an auto road that can take a less abled visitor to the summit as well. 
I enjoyed the hike up, my legs felt strong this morning even with my full 4 day re-supply in my pack. 
It saddened me to see so many disposable facemasks littering the trail, sadly marking a sign of our times.￼
An observation tower sits on the summit. It has been closed due to COVID this year, however, Carebear and I had the opportunity to enter and climb the tower. Lucky to be there as a park ranger arrived, he unlocked the door and allowed us access. The walls of the tower are filled with photos from the 1930s. On a clear day, one is able see the New York City Sky Line. This morning, it was not visible from the tower, though a few hours later, from the summit of Black Mountain, we could see it far off in the distance. It appeared as a faded pencil sketch on the horizon. I imagined it would be spectacular to see it at night when all the city lights are glowing. 
A small doe crossed the trail in front of me today, then slowly walked to the side to dine on some bushes. She didn’t seem to be afraid of me, I watched her for a few minutes before hiking on.

I also got to experience what is called the Lemon Squeezer. The trail becomes a narrow crevasse of broken boulders￼ that requires you to squeeze through. I had to remove my monster pack in order to get through the narrow rocks. It was fun and made the day a little more interesting.

Nearly 15 miles today on some pretty rocky terrain was what we were facing. We had an extra mile to make up due to the fact that we had gotten off trail yesterday to get out of the storm. 
Around noon, two men, who I assume were local, were coming North down the trail, they told us there was a hot dog truck at the next road crossing that was open until 3 p.m. Our intention was to stop at the Shelter about a mile up the trail and make our lunch, but news of a hot dog truck motivated us to push on 2 more miles past the shelter. Insight and I talked about what kind of dogs we were going to get and I fantasized about a chilly, cheese and onion dog with a bag of potato chips and an cold coke. I’m all about the food out here! I have really been enjoying all the New York Delis and road side food truck opportunities! Any time I can eat  something other than tuna on a tortilla or Ramen noodles, it’s a great day.
Making it to the road crossing by 1:30, only to find a closed up hot dog truck with a sign saying, open Friday, Saturday & Sunday. Today is Thursday... sadly.  
Though we were disappointed our dreams of delicious hot dogs were crushed, as we stood there on the road side, a sign pointing up the street said Bellvale Farm & Creamery. 
One door closed, another opens! Disappointment was again turned to excitement. 
Sitting on the lawn near the creamery, Insight, Carebear and I made our lunch. Mine was a tortilla with tuna and mayo. Not the hot dog I was dreaming about, but I ate it knowing ice cream was waiting for me. 
A hot fudge sundae with whipped cream and crushed nuts put a smile on my face and sent me back to the trail all sugared up, ready to take on the remaining 5 miles to camp. 
The last two miles today were long and arduous. Climbs on rock ledges that went up down, up down relentlessly. In one section, the only way down was by way of a rebar ladder on the rock face.  It brought me back to my days in Maine.

Hiking the Appalachian Trail has been nearly a lifetime dream of mine. Having the courage to stop talking about it, and actually put feet, head and heart on trail was born out a nagging desire to not wanting to be at the end of my life (whenever that comes) and have regrets of not really ever truly living. Regrets of: I wish I had, I always wanted to or I thought SOMEDAY I would. 
We systematically go through life thinking time is without end. I learned while in my mid-twenties, when I lost my dad at the young age of 49, never to put off my dreams. He (dad) was getting ready to retire after working for the town all his life. Hopes of spending his days fishing and hunting. Maybe even seeing Alaska, taking that trip he always wanted to but the time was never right, the extra money was never there. He left this earth, never being able to fulfill his dreams. It is because of him, I have had the courage, the drive and the desire to experience all that I can while I’m able.
If you knew you would be experiencing something for the very last time, would you do it differently? Would you look at it through different eyes? If you knew you were shutting the door of your business where you worked 60 hours a week, for the very last time, before a fire ravished the building in the middle of the night, would your last day on the job have been different? If you knew you were swimming in your pool for the very last time, before the harsh New England winter took it down, would you have enjoyed the water more? If you knew your baby boy would wake up the next morning and be too big to want to cuddle anymore, would you have held him tighter and longer? So many “for the last time” experiences, I didn’t know, couldn’t have known, would be my last. These are just a few of many in my life. 
Yes the answer, for me is yes. Unequivocally yes!
I knew when I woke up on October 16 that this day, would be my last day on trail. Insight, Carebear and I had talked weeks earlier of concerns about our hiking styles and whether or not we would be compatible and could make it work for the three of us. They had been off-trail for several weeks due to unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances, because of this, their stamina and mine were no long matched. Carebear was also still experiencing continual foot pain, though better, had never really gone away from the beginning of her journey on trail. Growing knee pain and a bout of dizziness were keeping her limited physically to lower miles and requiring her to take more days off trail to rest. On trail, we refer to this as “zeroing.” Zero miles hiked that day. 
I was capable of hiking more miles, moving quicker and not in need of zeroing so often. My goal was to move along the trail in the hopes of finishing before Christmas. I felt like I had been on trail for a long time, even though, because of COVID, I had to come off trail for two and a half months. Though home for that period of time, I was in lockdown, along with the rest of the world, my world stopped and every day was consumed with only thoughts of the trail. I struggled mentally. 
Knowing a Christmas finish was unrealistic doing the miles I was currently doing with Carebear and Insight, spending more money than I wanted to zeroing more frequently than I needed to, were both contributing factors for my decision to ultimately get off trail.
I wanted to hike the trail and finish. I wanted to get home to my husband and family. My life at home was waiting, my family had been so patient and supportive through all of it. What should have been a straightforward thru-hike northbound, starting in Georgia on March 6th, ending in Maine in early September, turned out to be much different and with many more challenges.
Due to COVID and having to come off trail for those two and a half months, my hike was forced to go in a whole different direction. There were many extra logistical challenges to overcome. Though, when I returned to the trail for the second time, I returned with a different attitude. No more expectations. One day at a time; I was going to be grateful for just being back on trail in whatever capacity that would be. I had excepted my dream of a traditional northbound thru-hike was now never going to happen. I came to terms with that after those 2 months of honestly, feeling sorry for myself, but 2020 was my year and this was to be  MY HIKE. I had spent 25 years dreaming of this “someday.”
Trail family is, tramily as we call it on trail, an endearingly term meaning “your people.” Those you hike with day in and day out who become like brothers, sisters, sons and daughters. Simply put, your family on trail. Over my 142 days on trail, I had a few different tramlies. Within two weeks of initially being on trail, my family was 8 strong. I returned to the trail with two of my original family members, Insight and Carebear, with the intention of completing the trail in some manner. French Roast and Turtle, who were also original tramily, joined us, hoping to hike the section through the Smokey Mountains along with the three of us. Sadly, they both got off trail after only a few days. 
Along the way our group of three met Plantly and Meaugi and eventually Mudcrack. All were family to me, hiking at times with all, other times with some and for a period of time with just one. For various reasons, both Insight & Carebear and Plantly & Meaugi left the trail at points, later to return. 
I found hiking speed and style to be my biggest challenge. Though I really loved having people on trail to camp with and share trail experiences, it was always a compromise of either hiking too few or too many miles each day. The phrase “hike your on hike” is definitely relevant. 
The trail, most of the time, was quiet. There were days we saw no one. Pre-COVID and on a normal year, there would have been many hikers, but this was not the case. 
Had it been any other year, I would have had an option to hike ahead at my speed finding others, knowing I would never be really alone. In the end, it came down to not being comfortable out there knowing the possibility of seeing any other Thru-hikers for days, was highly unlikely. I would, essentially, be alone on trail if I attempted to hike my own hike. Alone was never the experience I wanted. Starting in March, going North with the bubble was for a reason, I wanted the social trail experience along with all the others. Though there are many who hike the trail alone at times and fully enjoy it, I am not one of them. 
My last day on trail was rainy, windy and cold. I had twelve miles before I would cross the border into Pennsylvania, walk into Delaware Water Gap, stay the night at the Clarion Inn where Tom would be picking me up the next morning. I would be home. My journey would be over. 
Knowing those 12 miles would be my last few, I soaked in every minute. The rain, not making me wet and miserable, as it had at times in the past. When I got to the top of what I knew would be my last summit, I stopped, stood still and felt the wind and the rain on my face. It was different. I made a conscious choice and I did enjoy the water more, I hung on to that moment, a little longer and a little tighter. Then a smile as I looked to the sky, I was standing on what was called Raccoon Ridge. Just a coincidence or was it somehow a sign from Dad that this was supposed to be my ending? 
Now, just over a week since I’ve come home, I’m writing this final page, with a full heart. At peace with my decision. Grateful for the opportunity I was given to experience the magic of the trail. For the lessons it taught me each day. For the friendships it brought me. For the struggles that made me stronger. For empowering me and helping me grow into a better version of myself. 
For now, this is where it ends. However, this is not my finish. How and when, is currently undecided, though, I believe a second chapter is yet to come.
For those of you who have been reading my journals from the beginning, thank you for coming along on this journey, for walking the trail with me and for sharing my dream with so much excitement and encouragement.","The Mohegan Outdoor Center

Though there are a multitude of reasons many do not end up completing their thru-hike, no one in their wildest dreams would ever have imagined a pandemic would literally take over the world and force most of the thru-hiking class of 2020 off the trail. 
COVID-19 reached far, touched, and altered the lives of everyone, it changed the world we once knew. There is so much more I could write about on this horrific pandemic and I’d be a miss not mention the thousands who died and the thousands more doctors and nurses who became heroes putting their own lives on the line. It was, and now a year later, still is, history in the making but I’ll leave the rest to the history writers. 
This story, my story, is about the trail. 
In lockdown and very much depressed, I sat on the couch day after day. Though there were some that tried to make me look silly for voicing my feelings of depression and loss of the thru-hike, I had spent a lifetime dreaming of and year preparing and training for. They felt there were people suffering losses of a much greater magnitude. There was. I still couldn’t help but grieve the fact I had to come off the trail. After all, I was nearly 55 years old and although, there are some in their 70s who have hiked the trail, one never knows at what age physical limitations may be set upon them. 
This pandemic, along with all that was lost, and the political separation our country was facing, brought out the worst in people; Facebook and social media became a venture for judgment and hate. This was a time when the world needed understanding, I waited and longed for the day I could return to the woods.
Two and half months after leaving the trail, I did, in fact, return, starting again in Franklin, NC where I had gotten off, and here, I would continue my quest. 
Appalachian Trail Take Two as I referred to it. Hiking from Franklin, NC to Erwin, Tennessee before flipping up to Maine and hiking south. With the loss of those months off trail, there would not be time to make it to Maine before weather would stop a summit attempt so my hike became what the hiking community calls a Flip-Flop. By definition, this is where you start your journey going in one direction, (northbound in my case)and finish hiking in the other (southbound). It would be true to say, this is not the way I had envisioned my AT hike, nevertheless, I was thankful to have a second opportunity. We were, after all, in the year 2020 and nobody was living life the way they envisioned. 
Now heading south, Erwin, Tennessee would be my finish, though it no longer would be the epic finish at the summit sign on top of Katahdin. I also knew in my heart I could not consider myself an official thru-hiker without filling in the twenty-mile gap over the Wildcats that I had, for various reasons, skipped over. 
If you were following my travels, you know, I did not make it back to Erwin, Tennessee. I got off trail on Oct 16th after making it through Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey then crossing the border into Pennsylvania at Delaware Water Gap. 
To say last year on trail had its own set of special challenges would be an understatement but I had to ask myself, isn’t that why I’m out here? Overcome and persevere? The answer is yes, absolutely yes. Though in choosing to get off trail as I did, ultimately I fell short of obtaining those traits. 
At the time, a very wise and dear friend told me “The finish line isn't always what we think it will be when we take on massive endeavors. The journey and growth are the lessons and often take us on a different route and bring us to a finish line we couldn't have imagined at the start.” I sat with her words for a long time, and they brought me comfort then. 
The Appalachian Trail Conservancy or ATC for short, defines a thru-hike as “a hike of the entire Appalachian Trail in 12 months or less.”  
Though, in light of being asked to leave the trail due to the pandemic, the class of 2020 now has 12 months from the day they get back on trail to complete the rest of the trail and in doing so will still be recognized as a thru-hike. 
None of which matters to me. Recognition from the ATC has no bearing on my motives. My love for the trail is my motivation to finish and is not defined by rigid measurements. 
So with that said, I find myself once again prepared to go back out. Yes the journey and the growth were the lessons but Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania was not meant to be my finish line. I like to think of it as a only pause. 
The truth is, my hike has taken on a story much different from a conventional northbound thru-hike and while I still have 4 of the 14 states left to hike before I will have completed my dream of all dreams and be able to say that I hiked the entire Appalachian Trail, the goal continues to remain a lesson in how to overcome and persevere and I will strive each day to do that,  however, I have learned a different lesson. How to alter, change or modify. Adaptation! To adapt, because not everything, will always go as planned and... to be okay with that. 
This time out, I will reference it as the final chapter and by the grace of God, it will be! My restart date is not finalized yet, but I can say that it will be soon.I will be joining a few of my old trail friends, Insight & Carebear. Starting in Erwin, Tennessee hiking North to Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. Once that is completed, I will take two days in New Hampshire to hike that twenty-mile stretch over the wildcats and will at some point this summer, rehike Katahdin and get that summit photo! At which point, I will have hiked the entire 2,200 miles and then some!
Now, you may have had your fill of my trials and tribulations on trail and if that is the case,  I hold no ill feelings and I thank you for joining me thus far, but should you find yourself, like me, still urging to get mud on your boots, sleep under the stars and see more views from the summits then please join me again. And if you are new to my journals, to you, I say welcome to my crazy adventures and thank you to all of you who will be tuning in.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633940,"We (Carebear, Insight & I) arrived at Uncle Johnny’s Hostel in Erwin, Tennessee after 2 days on the road. Our rental car was turned in to Enterprise in Johnson City by 10 a.m., and we were shuttled to Uncle Johnny’s. Here, we will stay the night in a very modest four-bunk cabin and be back on the trail tomorrow morning! 
It will be the beginning of the 900+ miles I have remaining to finally complete what I started back in March of last year. 
My emotions are very mixed this time out but one thing is for sure, I don’t feel nearly as physically prepared as I have in the past, however, with that said, I also don’t have the fear of the unknown and for that I am grateful. 
I ran into Hawk again. This is the second time I’ve met him on trail. Once in Maine and today in Erwin. He hiked into the hostel this afternoon and will be spending the night here. Those of you who are followers of the AT will know who Hawk is but for those of you who don’t, Hawk is somewhat of a celebrity here on trail. I can best describe him as a hiking madman. This is his 5th time hiking the Appalachian Trail. His story is pretty interesting and you can find him on YouTube under Craig Mains. 
The rest of the day was pretty low key. We sat around talking with other thru-hikers most of the afternoon. Most had started in early February and had made their way to Uncle Johnny’s. It was nice to see and talk with other hikers, the social aspect was definitely lacking on the trail in 2020. Rockshocks, Sundance, Patriot, Killer and Wizard all shared their stories. 
We had dinner delivered from a local pizza place, ate it here in the cabin. I will be turning in just as soon as I finish this journal. 
Tomorrow, we start back on trail! I’m excited and want morning to come quick.","Home to Erwin Tennessee/Uncle Johnny’s

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633941,"Wow, today was certainly a challenge! Not that the terrain was anything crazy by any means, and we only hiked ten miles, but I struggled with my heavy pack. Truthfully, it’s no heavier than it was when I got off trail in October but my body is not conditioned to carrying an extra 32 to pounds up and down mountains after being home for 5 months. I know it will take a few weeks to regain my trail legs, and I hope to feel stronger as the days progress. 
The temps got up in the low 60s this afternoon, and I hiked in shorts and a t-shirt. Perfect hiking weather until you stop moving and then the puffy coat had to come out. 
We stopped for a quick lunch at Curley Maple Gap Shelter where we met Schooby & Poptart, a local couple camping for the weekend. Chatted with them over lunch and then moved on. 
There really wasn’t a lot of views today that weren’t obstructed by trees, but the terrain was pleasant and the sun was shining so I will call it a pretty good first day back!
We arrived pretty early to camp with only doing 10 miles, but we didn’t want to push it being our first day out so we settled for a stealth site just steps from the trail and went to work setting up our tents. 
I enjoyed an early dinner of fine dining out of a gallon-size ziplock bag of couscous, salmon and a fresh avocado that I packed out. It tasted wonderful, as most food does on trail! I’m hoping it gives me a powerhouse of energy tomorrow. We’ll see.","Uncle Johnny’s Erwin Tennessee

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633942,"It was pretty cold last night. Temps got down in the low 30s. I slept with my wool base layer, socks and my puffy jacket. My body stayed warm enough in my 15 degree sleeping bag, but the air outside of my bag was freezing making it hard to get up and moving this morning. 
I made coffee in the vestibule of my tent so I could keep most of my body still in my bag. Knowing we only had about 8 miles to get to camp today, none of us were in much hurry to get moving in the cold. 
The day did warm up beautifully, by noon it was up into the 60s with sunny skies. 
We hiked over whats called Beauty Spot Cleaning and got our fist real unobtrusive views of the majestic mountains then up and over Unaka Mountain with an elevation of 5180 feet. I found myself repeating how thankful I was for these Tennessee switchbacks though I struggled and moved slowly up nevertheless. 
For all my efforts, there was no payoff. Unaka had zero views. It did however, turn into a dense forest of spruce pines that had me feeling like I was back in the Smoky Mountains. 
We stopped trail side for a leisurely lunch and soaked up the warmth of the sun filtering through the trees. 
It was another pretty early day when we arrived to camp giving us time to set up our tents and do our camp chores while the sun was still up. 
Another Thru-hiker arrived shortly after and introduced himself as Rockman. While waiting for dinner to rehydrate, we had the opportunity to chat for a bit. He lives here in Tennessee, is 56 years old, started in Georgia and has been on trail for 30 days so far. 
As I’m writing this lying in my tent, I can hear a group of hikers just coming into the shelter. I’m sure we will meet some of them in the morning. Too cold and tired to get up and go socialize tonight.","Stealth Campsite near Red Fork Rd

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633946,"I didn’t sleep that well again last night. I love my tent, but could hear the wind blowing all night, so I broke out my ear plugs. It helped a little. 
It was a two-cup-of-coffee kind of morning. Again, we took our time getting out of camp. It’s hard to want to get out of your sleeping bag when it’s cold and windy. 
Before leaving camp, I met Goldie, Rapture and Captain America. They were the hikers I heard come in last night. All three are Thru-hikers who started in Georgia in February.
No amazing views today, but the forest was pretty, and the trail was smooth. That’s not to say we didn’t have lots of climbing, we did, and I struggled again today. I’m trying to give myself grace and know that I will eventually build my legs and stamina back up, but it’s disappointing when I’m struggling to do ten miles on these nicely grated trails with all their switchbacks. 
We are camping tonight at Clyde Smith Shelter. There are two other Thru-hikers with us. Brad-(no trail name yet) and Distress, 19-year-old young man from Amherst, Massachusetts. 
Tomorrow, we hike over Roan Mountain.  It’s a big one! 6,286 ft elevation!","Cherry Gap Shelter

Somehow,  I managed to lose my glasses. Given the fact that I can’t read or see my phone without them, sadly I have been unable to journal for the last 3 nights so I’m going to try to play catch up here. 
Today is Saturday, March 27. Carebear, Insight and myself are currently in the town of Roan Mountain at Mountain Harbour Hostel. There is a tornado warning in effect as I’m writing this, and we are experiencing severe thunderstorms. There are two other hikers here, Patriot and Gadget along with David and Stacy who are employees here. We are all gathered in the lower level of the hostel waiting for this to pass and listening to the emergency warnings come over the TV. 
I’m using this time as an opportunity to get caught up on my journals, but I’m finding it hard to concentrate and even harder to recall the events of the last three days as they happen on trail so I’m going to take the pressure off myself and just sum it all up in one entry. 
The weather was pretty decent on the climb up to Roan Mt. Insight hiked half the day with Carebear and I and then went on ahead after we stopped for lunch. Our plan was to meet at the Roan High Shelter (the highest shelter on the entire AT) where we planned to spend the night. Rain was predicted for early the next morning, and none of us wanted to be packing up a wet tent. 
When Carebear and I arrived at the shelter, Insight was making a valiant effort to get a fire going, though in the end, the ground was just too saturated at the high elevation to get any dry wood. Thus, there was not fire. 
The shelter slept 15 and there was nobody there when we first arrived, eventually though, a group of 8 young hikers joined us. 
The following day will go down as one of the worst days/night on trail. The day started with the expected rain. No one sets out to hike 2,200 miles and thinks there is not going to be some days of hiking in the rain. It’s a given. Part of the trail. Good weather days and bad. All of them make it the AT experience. I expected and accepted it. Always telling myself not to let the things I can not change get to me.
We hiked in the rain for several hours. Though we had all our rain gear on, we were soaked to the bone. It is impossible to stay dry no matter how much rain gear you wear when you are in hours of relentless rain.  
The plan was to push the miles and get into town that evening, however, just as we were heading into Bradly Gap and over Hump Mt.(the bald) thunder and lightning was overhead. We had no choice but to retreat back to tree cover, set up our tents and take cover. 
I spent the night in a puddle that was my tent, trying to stay afloat on my sleep pad. Every single thing was wet, strong winds blew all night, and the rain never let up. I got not a minutes sleep. The situation was far from ideal however to attempt to hike over 3 miles on an exposed ridge was neither smart nor safe in any way! We chose the best of two evils. 
With morning came the sunshine. We packed up and headed the 7 miles to town.
The views on the bald were exceptional, and it only confirmed we made the right decision by taking shelter the night before. 
The hike into town was 7 miles of mostly down hill after going over the bald. I have been experiencing heel and ankle pain in my left foot. The down hills make it worse. I came on trail with it and hoped I could just walk it off. Not the case. 
I struggled getting to town. My ankle not letting me move as I wanted to. Frustration set in. Between the combination of no sleep, no morning coffee and my swollen ankle, I will be honest, I was pretty miserable. 
My day improved once we got to Mountain Harbour Hostel. After taking a hot shower and laying out all my gear to dry out, I got a ride into town where I was able to buy a new pair of glasses. I shared the shuttle with Wisler, another Thru-hiker staying at Mountain Harbour who was seeing a doctor for an infected finger. 
I am now able to see once again!
Later that evening, we all ordered food from the food truck that is permanently parked here at the hostel and I shared stories with Papa Smerf and Whisler then headed to my bunk to elevate my swollen foot. 
Carebear had a birthday on Thursday, the day we had to shelter down in our tents. Turning 42 on trail and having the worst birthday of her life, Insight booked the Jefferson Room in the B&B where she was able to spend a night in luxury complete with a jacuzzi tub. 
Today, we have a planned zero. This morning, we enjoyed an amazing breakfast, I think the best breakfast I’ve had so far on trail! 
After breakfast, I soaked my foot in the cold river hoping to bring down the swelling, and Insight gave me an 800 ibuprofen. The plan for today was to stay off my foot.
While out on the deck, organizing our Resupply for the next 3 days, this crazy storm blew in. A tree fell right across the driveway, and we were all ordered to come downstairs to the room in the lower level of the hostel and take cover. Tornado warnings were coming in and it was quite a scare. I said a prayer for Whisler my new friend, who had hiked out this morning.","

I actually slept well in the bunk house last night despite sleeping in a bed beside a fellow hiker named Snorzilla! 
We enjoyed another amazing breakfast this morning and spent the rest of the day lounging around. I am not a fan of the double zeros and wish we were back on trail. I do believe it was the right decision to stay an extra day and avoid the dangerous weather, however, I find it hard to get back out there after more than one day off-trail. 
Gadget, Patriot, Snorzilla and Michael all hikers who were here yesterday, have also zeroed again today.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634102,"It was 10:30 a.m. before we left Mountain Harbour this morning. Carebear was experiencing more dizzy spells. She was fortunate that there was a nurse at the hostel who was able to check her heart rate and take her blood pressure. She ruled out low blood pressure and dehydration, but there is no clear reason for the dizziness. Last October she (Carebear) had one other spell while on trail but nothing since then until this morning. She thinks it may be vertigo, but no one knows for sure. If she continues to have these episodes, she will need to get off-trail and seek medical testing. 
As for today, we eventually hiked out the ten miles to the tent sight where we are camping tonight. It’s a great little spot right near the river. Michael, who was with us at the hostel, is camping here tonight, and so is GoJoe and his young daughter Rocky; they too were at the hostel yesterday. All three are doing a section hike of the trail. 
The weather today was beautiful, and I couldn’t have been more thankful for the sunshine and blue skies. There was zero wind and just an all-around perfect weather day. 
Our hike took us by 2 pretty amazing waterfalls, across a few meadows and even past a cemetery. At one point, we had a river crossing. On any other day, I would have been able to rock hop across, however, the heavy rains from the last two days made it impossible to get across without getting your shoes wet. As I was crossing, I stepped off the rock, and my foot went in up to my knee which threw me off off balance. If it wasn’t for Insight who was quick to grab the back of my pack and keep me for falling on my ass, myself and all my gear would have been soaked! 
I sloshed the remaining miles to camp. It’s too cold tonight for my shoes and socks to dry. Putting them on in the morning should be fun.","Mountain Harbour Hostel/Roan Mountain

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634197,"I slept well last night. It was the first night since getting back on trail that I actually slept most the night. Our tent sight was beside a stream, and the sound of the water running was very soothing. It was also the first night void of any wind blowing so that helped as well. I find it hard to get sleep when all I can hear is the wind at night. 
I hiked 11 miles today though the trail was really pretty uneventful. It was a full day of PUDS (pointless ups and downs). There were only two lookout points today giving me a brief view of the mountains. Rock-hopping across Hardcore Cascades was probably the highlight of my day. 
The temperature got hot, the sky had not a cloud, and I was sweating on the climbs. I arrived at camp about 3:30, set up my tent, filled water bottles and hung my bear rope then laid on the grass in the sun. It felt good to be done hiking for the day. My ankle is still sore. I have been soaking in the streams and taking ibuprofen. It helps a little. 
Michael who now goes by Tyveck is tenting with us again tonight and a woman who introduced herself as Flower just joined us as well.

Guided by our headlamps, Insight, Carebear, and I made the 4 mile hike down to Dennis Cove Road where we waited in the pouring rain for a hour until John from Boots Off Hostel was able to pick us up. The wait was miserable, we were cold once we stopped hiking, and the rain was relentless. 
It was 9 a.m. when we arrived at the hostel after a quick stop to grab a coffee and an Egg McMuffin at the near by McDonalds. 
Our bunks weren’t ready until noon, so we gathered with the other hikers in the common room and tried to dry out. 
After a most amazing hot shower and the breakfast from Mc Donalds, I felt better. Happy actually! 
Gadget, Whistler & Snorzilla were here when we arrived. I was happy to see my friends again. They all had stayed here the night before, Gadget and Whistler hiked out today, Snorzilla is staying another night. We talked for awhile and then I said goodbye again. I hope to see them in Damascus in a few days though I’m not sure I will. They are both faster hikers, doing bigger miles. 
We are staying in the bunk room tonight. It’s a cozy little room with 8 bunks each complete with a privacy curtain. They also have tiny cabins that sleep 3.

All courtesy of Boots Off. 
The trail was a beautiful walk along the river this morning. The water, high due to all the rain we have had recently. There were several bridge crossings, and we passed Laurel Falls, then the trail began to climb and continued to climb for the next 3 miles. By the time we reached the summit, snow was accumulating on the trees and the ground. It made for a pretty photo, but it was definitely cold. 
I meet Christine on trail today. She is from Connecticut and is doing a long section the trail. She was stopped having lunch and as I walked by, she mentioned, I looked familiar. Turns out, she had been following me through my journals.  
We had hiked back to the hostel by noon, popped a frozen pizza that was purchased at the hostel store in the oven, ate, showered and were feeling really thankful to back in warm, clean clothes once again. 
Christine arrived a few hours later and will be staying the night as well.
The hostel runs a shuttle into town every night at 6 p.m. They stop at the Redi Mart for anyone needing to due a Resupply and then a grab-and-go at either McDonalds or Subway. Choices are limited in this town.
I purchased all the fixings for a big salad topped with chicken and feta cheese. Back at the hostel, Insight and I went to work preparing dinner. It was wonderful to eat a meal with fresh vegetables! 
The 8.6 miles today were a slack pack back to the Hostel. We had reserved one of the tiny cabins for the night. The temperature is predicted to fall to a low of 19 degrees overnight.

Again, the temps tonight are predicted to be dangerously low. Because of this, we are spending one more night here at the hostel. In all honesty, I want to be on trail. Though we have hiked a little each day, coming back to the hostel at night, it feels like little progress. I tell myself slow progress is better than no progress but in truth, I’m frustrated. The weather has been very challenging. Heavy rains, tornado warnings, thunder and lightning storms, flash flooding and freeze warnings have all been thrown our way in the 13 days we have been back on trail. 
It’s important to keep a positive attitude out here, I’m trying. I know the days will get warmer, and the daylight will be longer. I’m hoping that will lead to bigger miles, and I will be able to progress down the trail at a little fast pace. The positive in all of this, the lower miles have been better for my ankle which is still bothering me and requiring a steady dose of Ibuprofen.
In order not to waste the day, we did a 5 mile slack pack today. The trail went around Watuga Lake. It was a very enjoyable and picturesque hike crossing the Watuga Lake Damn.

The weather had us slack packing and going back to the hostel overnight. Between all the heavy rain and the temperature in the teens, we played it safe and stayed out of the elements the last few nights. 
I was happy to be back on trail. The sun shined today, it was crisp and cool. Perfect hiking weather. 
I hiked with Carebear and Insight in the morning. We stopped for a early lunch at Vandventer Shelter. Sitting on the rocks behind the shelter, afforded us a view of Wataug Lake off in the distance and gave us a opportunity to soak up the warmth from the sun. I took a longer lunch then normal, and Carebear and Insight hiked on ahead. 
The trail was pretty much a continuous climb today with little in the way of view. I put my music on, sang along and just enjoyed the forest today. 
I reached Iron Mountain Shelter about 3:15. My mind and body wanted to do more miles, but my ankle is hindering that. After nearly 12 miles my foot was telling me to stop. I listen. 
It’s going to be cold tonight, but not the lows like the last two nights. I’m in my tent now, tucked in my sleeping bag with all my layers on so I can keep warm, but my hands are cold as write this. Time to put down the pen and get zipped up my bag.","Wilber Damn Rd

I sat in my tent, made my first cup of coffee in the vestibule all the while feeling a little sad that I wouldn’t be sharing my Easter traditions with family this year. 
The day warmed up nicely and just kept getting better. 
We were blessed with trail magic from Lieutenant Dan. She was in the parking lot at TN 91 when we came out of the woods. There was fresh fruit, all kinds of chips, muffins and more. She had water to fill our bottles, ziplock bags for the taking and even offered to take our trash! The cooler was stocked with V8 juices and I will tell you, it was such a delicious treat! It immediately lifted my spirits. 
Colorful Easter Eggs dangled from the trees across the road as we left Lieutenant Dan and wonderful trail magic she provided. Though not mytraditional Easter, the day was turning out pretty special. 
We walked through a beautiful pasture with breathtaking views. An old wooden barn sat high on the hill and was adorned by the iconic AT symbol. I couldn’t of loved that stretch of trail any more! 
At Double Spring Shelter, we stopped for lunch. Tyveck, our new friend, has been hiking and camping with Carebear,  Insight and I these last few days. He lives in Virginia is out doing a long section hike. His company is welcomed, and we have been enjoying having him around. 
Cell service was good today, I was able to FaceTime my family and say Happy Easter. It was wonderful to see everyone and tell them I love and miss them. 
Tonight, we are camping in Low Gap. It’s close to the road, and I can hear many vehicles and motorcycles. It’s odd to hear so much noice, I’m used to the silence of the forest.","Iron Mountain Shelter

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634457,"Today was tough. We broke camp and were on trail by 8:00 a.m. This morning was noticeably warmer than yesterday, and I was happy about that. 
The trail was nicely graded with rolling hills. I should have been able to enjoy it, but my foot was hurting. I had taken an 800mg ibuprofen before leaving camp, but it didn’t do much for the pain.  
We stopped at Abington Shelter for an early lunch then pushed on. 
The goal was to hike 10 miles to the Ruins where we planned to camp for the night. I hobbled to get there. Tyveck, Insight & Carebear were there waiting, I was the last to arrive. All of us were low on water, and there was no water source near the campsite, we had no choice but to hike on. 
2 miles later, we crossed the state line into Virginia. I wanted to be more excited, but again, the pain in my ankle had me pretty miserable. I stopped for a quick photo but never captured the state line crossing on video.
We had 2 more miles to get to the water source and set up our tents. I hobbled the whole way there. 
When we finally arrived, the campsite was full. There was a Boy Scout troup there. 8 to 9 tents all set up. 
We called Broken Fiddle Hostel in the hopes that they would have 3 bunks available. They did. 
By the time I reached Damascus, my foot felt like there was knife in my heal. 
After settling into the hostel and taking a shower, I soaked my foot in a cooler full of ice water while Insight and Carebear walked down to the Damascus Diner to pick up our dinner. 
Damascus is such a wonderful, little town with everything in walking distance. I wanted to go exploring, but I couldn’t walk one more step. 
Tomorrow, Treehouse, who runs the hostel, is giving me a ride into Abington where I have an appointment at the urgent care.","Low Gap Us 421

Woke about 6:30 a.m. Insight was already getting ready to walk to the gas station for coffee. He offered to bring me back a cup. We drank our coffees in our bunk room while all the others were still asleep. 
When the diner opened at 8 a.m., Carebear and Insight went for breakfast. I stayed behind, not wanting to walk on my sore foot any more than necessary. They brought me back a delicious breakfast, appropriately named, the thru-hiker. It was a beef burger topped with a thick slab of bacon and an egg accompanied by home fries and onions. I ate every bit!
My appointment at Urgent Care was for 10 a.m. Treehouse drove me the 10 miles into Abington. 
After an exam and an X-ray, I was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis and a small bone spur in my heal. Ice, elevation and rest was what the doctor prescribed. Oh, and lots of ice cream (I may have made that part up). All kidding aside, not what any hiker wants to hear. 
I spent the rest of the day icing and elevating. Staying off my foot as much as possible. I even bought gel heal inserts for my shoes hoping to aid in the relief.
At 5:30, Tyveck, who is staying at Carzy Larezy met Carebear, Insight and I, and we all walked down to the diner for dinner. My foot hurt. 
I ordered a big bowl of collard greens, it came with a corn muffin, buffalo chicken tenders and a veggie burrito. It was yummy and filling! 
After dinner, I said goodbye to Tyveck. He hikes out tomorrow and will finish his is section hike on Friday. It was nice having him around for a few weeks. We promised to keep in touch through FB.

I’m frustrated with all of this, knowing I was able to hike over 1,200 miles last year with not so much as a blister.  Once again, I need to accept the things I can not change and take things one day at a time. Hard lesson. It’s become apparent, I need to be reminded of this over and over again. 
I spent the day icing and elevating. The down time gave me plenty of time to look at my AWOL Guide and work on a plan for the next stretch to Marion.

My foot was feeling a little better after resting it for two days, but we had 15.6 miles ahead of us today. 
The trail traveled parallel to the Virginia Creeper Trail for quite a ways today, eventually becoming the same trail for about a mile and a half. 
I just learned of the Virginia Creeper. It’s an old railroad turned into a cycling path. It’s very popular here in Damascus. There are several places that rent bikes and provide shuttles if you choose to only go one way. 
Trail History: The Virginia Creeper Trail began as a Native American footpath. Later, the European pioneers, as well as early explorer Daniel Boone, used the trail. Shortly before 1900, W.E. Mingea constructed the Virginia- Carolina Railroad from Abingdon to Damascus. In 1905, the Hassinger Lumber Company extended the line to Konnarock and Elkland, North Carolina. In its day, the line hauled lumber, iron ore, supplies, and passengers. Its nickname, Virginia Creeper, came from the early steam locomotives that struggled slowly up the railroads steep grades. The Virginia Creeper engine and tinder are now on display at the Abingdon trailhead. Virginia Creeper is also the name of a vine that grows prolifically in the area.
With 100 trestles and bridges, sharp curves, and steep grades, the Virginia Creeper was the typical mountain railroad. Train crews faced washouts, rock slides, and other hazards, but it was economics that sounded the lines death whistle. Having failed to turn a profit since the Great Depression, the Creeper ran its last train on March 31, 1977.
Less than a century after the railroad arrived, the Virginia Creeper once again became a quiet trail. Through the work of volunteers and with help from local and federal governments, the Creeper became a national recreation trail.
Between Abingdon and Damascus, the trail right-of-way belongs to the two towns. Although the public legally has the right to use the trail, most of the actual land between Abingdon and the iron bridge East of Damascus is privately owned. The 15.9 miles of trail between iron bridge (mile 18.4) to the state line are part of the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area in the Jefferson National Forest. Except for a short stretch through Taylor's Valley, the public owns both the right-of-way and the actual property.
The Virginia Creeper Trail traverses some of the most rugged and picturesque scenery in the Eastern United States and is widely lauded as one of the most beautiful trails on the continent. The total trail length is 34.3 miles.
My foot did okay for the first several miles. I even stopped at one of the river crossing and soaked them in the cold water to help keep the swelling down. After about ten miles, I was feeling more intense pain. I struggled the last 2.5 miles to make it to camp. My foot throbbing. 
We arrived at Lost Mountain Shelter around 5:15 p.m. The shelter sleeps 8, it was already full, there were several tents already set up. We chose a spot and quickly got to work setting up. The rain started just as I got all my gear inside and under cover. I thank God for holding off on the rain until I was set up and able to get my gear under the shelter of my tent. 
A quick dinner and straight to my tent. I’m in my bag with my sore feet on my pack. It feels so good to be off them!","Broken Fiddle Hostel/Damascus Virginia

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634787,"Today was only a little over 12 miles but it was a tough one. Lots of elevation, however, we were rewarded with amazing views! That always helps. 
Buzzers Rock was the first big climb of the day. It was 4.8 miles of incline. When I finally reached the top, Carebear and Insight were making their lunch. I joined them, more than was happy to sit for a while. Lunch with a near 360 view. Amazing!
I experienced something crazy and a degree of scary shortly after lunch. A weather phenomenon called a Dirt/Dust Devil.   
By definition- dust devil - a miniature whirlwind strong enough to whip dust and leaves and litter into the airwhirlwind - a more or less vertical column of air whirling around itself as it moves over the surface of the Earth. They are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property. They are comparable to tornadoes in that both are a weather phenomenon involving a vertically oriented rotating column of wind.
We, Carebear, Insight and I had just stopped at a piped spring to fill up our water bottles. We started walking down this dirt road, Carebear stopped on the side of the road briefly to drink some water, myself and Insight, followed the trail a few feet into the woods. Just then, we heard what we thought was a car speeding down the road, Carebear moved up the trail a few feet and when we looked, there was a brown funnel of dirt flying the down the road. It took us a few seconds to realize what was happening. Insight knew immediately what it was and the three of us stood there stunned. That was a first for me! Never have I ever, until today experienced a Dust Devil.
Things continued to get interesting as the day progressed. It was near the end of the day, I was less than a half mile from our shelter when in the middle of the trail stood a wild pony. Super cool! It made my day! 
The area is called Grayson Highlands, and it is known to have wild ponies. It did not disappoint!
We arrived at Thomas Nob Shelter around 5 p.m. Gladiator, who passed us on the trail, was already there along with another woman who is also thru-hiking. She goes by Scatterbrain. 
Blue Jacket and our new friend Jordon (no trail name yet) who we met on trail a few miles before the shelter, arrived shortly after. We all set up our pads and bags up in the shelter. Rain and thunderstorms are predicted to come in overnight.

One of the wild ponies was standing right in front of the shelter. He was very curious as to what I was doing as I crouched down a few feet away in the dark. I had to keep saying, “stay, stay!” in an effort to hold him off. As I’m writing this, it sound comical now. 
After a quick coffee, we were on trail before 8 a.m. Blue and Jordan hiked out with the three of us, Glacier and Scatterbrain left before us. 
The weather was misty and foggy. We had 3.6 miles to the pick-up point where Dennis, the owner of The Grayson Highland Store and Inn, would be waiting for us. We had a room reserved for the day. Once again, heavy rains and thunderstorms were coming. Jordan also got the shuttle and a room here at the Highlands Store. 
The four of us ordered burgers and fries from the store’s grill and had lunch together. I spent the rest of the afternoon elevating and resting my foot. Later for dinner, we bought a box of spaghetti and a jar of sauce from the store and cooked it in our room.

I am experiencing so many wonderful first-time-ever things out here. Though the trail can be tough, taking everything I got most days, it also gives back in so many ways. 
Our original  plan was to camp at Old Orchard Shelter, it was 1:30 when we arrived, we ate lunch then decided to push on. 
Jordan hiked with us today and is camping with us tonight as well. After dinner, he built a nice fire. It’s rare to have fire out here. We are usually too tired after hiking all day. Most nights, it’s enough to just set up our tents, cook dinner then crawl in our bags.

It was a luxury to sit at the picnic table, more so, to use the privy. The campsites are nice because there are usually fewer people than at the shelter, though you end up sacrificing all the amenities that the shelters provide. Out here, I appreciate so many things I take for granted at home. The comfort of eating my breakfast at a table for one. 
Today’s hike was only about 10 miles. Again not much to speak of. Just trail and trees. 
Jordan got his trail name today. I suggest he be called Sparky. Coming on trail, Jordan brought a flint that his dad designed, produces and sells. The company’s websites is Purefire Tactical. Building fires using this amazing fire starter, Jordan has been taking photos for his dad’s website. Last night, he demonstrated how to scrape the magnesium to make a spark.

The thought of having lunch there motivated all of us to move quickly down the trail. By 1:45, we had warm chips and salsa in front of us as we awaited our meals. 
I picked up a pair of insoles, designed for helping Plantar Fasciitis, while at Walmart, when resupplying the other day. Without the weight of my full pack, the addition of the new insoles and a day of rest yesterday, I was able to move pretty well today for about 10 miles before the pain started to become intense again. 
The terrain was relatively gentle, though the only view we got today was that of Walker Mountain. We did however get to see the Lindamood Schoolhouse, an old one room school built in 1894. It’s located right on the trail and is part of the Settlers Museum, however, that was closed do to COVID. Hikers are allowed to spend the night in the school house if they choose to.

The trail took us through some beautiful pastures. I have a fondness for the openness, the old wooden fences, weathered posts wrapped in barbed wire. There is something tranquil about cattle grazing on the countryside. 
We had about 6 styles to climb over today. Not surprising with all the pasture hiking. 
The weather, a mix of sun and clouds. It’s still pretty cold here in Virginia. This surprises me. Mid April, I expected it to be warmer. I find myself having to wear my coat, unless I’m climbing, then I work up a sweat. 
Coming back to the hostel for one more night, gave us the opportunity to cook a “real” dinner. Steak kabobs with fresh vegetables! 
We had purchased all the fixings the night before when Bob picked us up at the trailhead.

We got word of a freeze warning. Rain/sleet predicted for tomorrow with a low temperature tomorrow night of 27. So, our plan became: hike 13.2 today to Lickskillet Hostel, spend the night, be shuttled north, slack pack southbound the 9 miles tomorrow in the cold rain back to Lickskillet where we can spend the night again and avoid camping in freezing temps, take a hot shower and dry our clothes. This way, we still make the miles but avoid camping in the mountains. Though the plan makes the most sense, honestly, camping in below freezing temps when soaked from hiking in all day rain, is not smart nor safe, I find myself a little aggravated by the continual weather challenges. I want to be able to just hike down the trail with fewer logistics.  
“God, grant me the serenity to except the things I can not change.”
With all that said, Lickskillet is a pretty unique hostel, and this unexpected plan gives me the opportunity to experience it. It’s a church. Or should I say, it was a church turned hostel. It still looks like a church, only all the pews have been removed and replaced with beds. It’s one large open room. The bunks, shuttles and all the supplies are donation-based. Mongo is a former thru-hiker, originally from Florida, who now owns and operates the hostel.

We just kept moving. 
It was one of those days when you just want to get the miles done. Enjoyment wasn’t the objective. Too cold! 
Despite the weather challenges, we did have a little excitement in our day. At one point in the morning, a great big Bull was standing in the middle of the trail. He wasn’t moving nor was he happy to let us pass. His house ... we went around! 
There were several foot bridge crossings today which is not all that unusual, a really cool suspension bridge though, now that was a treat.
Mongo was waiting for us at the trail head, he drove us to a wonderful Mennonite store that made homemade soups, sandwiches and baked goods. They also sold many grocery items in bulk. 
I order a Reuben, took it back to the hostel for lunch and by God, if it wasn’t, the best Reuben I’ve ever eaten! I also ordered fried cheese curds, those were gone before I even got out of the truck.
After lunch, I took a hot shower, it felt amazing, though it was an outdoor shower, so it was a struggle to shut off the water and get dressed in the cold air.

It’s funny how things happen. I crossed paths with a woman today who lives in Massachusetts, in the town next to mine. Her trail name is Mother Nature, she is 79 years old. Her and her husband (Father Time) had thru-hiked the trail years ago. Now, at her age, she gets out for day hikes only. Her husband no longer hikes but drives her to and from the trail heads. We talked for a few minutes, both agreeing it is currently warmer in New England than it is here in Virginia. We wished each other well, than parted ways. 
Tonight, we are staying at Woods Hole Hostel. This hostel came highly recommended by several fellow hiker friends who had stayed here in the past. I was looking forward to our stay. “One of the best hostels on the entire AT.” A favorite, not to be missed, was how it was presented by many.
Sadly, we did not have that experience. 
We had made a reservation and payed for a private room with three beds in the main house, instead of the bunkhouse. The website promotes their local, organic farm fresh community meals, yoga classes and an overall wonderful place to rest and relax. 
Upon arrival, we were giving directions up to our room, told we could shower but towels weren’t available yet, though they would bring them up shortly. Also told there would be no dinner served tonight. Bread & Cheese would be offered instead. 
We never got a tour of the place, which is typical procedure in every hostel, they tell you how they like to operate the hostel, where you can find things, the do’s and don’ts, expectations, what’s available, etc ... and it’s very common to be told to make yourself at home. There was none of that. 
I could go into great detail about the way we were treated, greeted and the overall vibe of this place, I will just say, after talking to Neville, she is the owner and operator, in her words, things have changed. She is under a great deal of stress, both personally and professionally, and it has apparently changed the vibe and operation of this hostel.

At two or three locations along the trail, I was rewarded with a view. I will say, so far, Virginia hasn’t handed out many views, so today was a welcome exception.

I really thought the insoles and heel cups had me going in the right direction. Clearly, the stress of all the down hill continues to aggravate it. Big sigh.","Woods Hole Hostel

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635582,"Angels Rest Hostel is by far, my favorite hostel so far. Dr. Pippa, owner and operator, is amazing. 
We are here today on a planned zero, I couldn’t be happier for two reasons: the first, my foot gets a day to really rest, second, the weather is 100% rain all day today. 
Pearisburg, VA, where this hostel is located, is a city with pretty much everything in walking distance. This morning, in an effort to really lighten my pack weight, I went through and reassessed everything I was carrying. I ended up shipping a box home, shaving off, I’m guessing, maybe 3.5 to 4 pounds. That should make a substantial difference. 
The trick out here is to find a balance. Carrying only what you need and use everyday without much extra. I’m hoping carrying less weight on my back will equal, less stress on my foot. Fingers crossed. 
Insight, Carebear and I had lunch at the local Mexican restaurant. I ordered a salad with grilled chicken and I side of rice & beans. On the way back to the hostel, I stopped at the Food Lion where I picked up some fresh fruit: a banana, an orange and an apple. Two peppers, a green and an orange, some tiny tomatoes and a container of hummus. Two bottles of chocolate milk, a Gatorade and,  well.... a pint of Haagen Dazs coffee ice cream.

Rikki Tikki a fellow hiker from Connecticut, who had just arrived here (Angels Rest Hostel) last night, to begin his section, hiked with Insight, Carebear and I on our 5 mile slack. 
He and I talked about Bigelow Hollow State Park in Union, CT. It’s one of my favorite local places to hike, it’s only an hour drive from my home.  Being from Connecticut, it’s one of Rikki Tikki’s as well. 
I crossed the 1,500 mile mark today, however, my calculations on my journals, videos and guide book are all slightly off. It’s been hard to be precise given the direction changes from north to south and south to north again. Though it may not be exactly accurate placement, rest assured, I will hike all 2,200 miles to complete the entire trail!
Later in the afternoon, Rikki invited me to jump in with him (he has his car parked here) on his run to Walmart. I was happy for the invitation. I picked up 2 of the dehydrated Mountain House meals and a bottle of Tide Delicate laundry detergent so I could wash my down jacket when I got back to the hostel. To say it really needs a washing might be an understatement 🤮

I found myself really enjoying the trail today, not just rushing through the day trying to get the miles done. It would be fair to say, weather makes all the difference in what kind of a day I have on trail. 
We hiked the 15 miles of trail that had been closed because of a severe ice storm, that took down hundreds of trees and the power lines. The trail reopened just last week to hikers, but there are still several blow downs across the trail. Because of this, we had to bushwhack around for many miles today. It’s both physically and mentally draining, but there was no way I was going to allow the extra effort to ruin this beautiful day. 
I hiked slowly and deliberately today. Listening to the sounds of the forest. I thought about my Dad, about all the trail volunteers and maintainers, about all those who walked the trail before me, I thought about food, my thoughts always turn to food 😉
With the nice weather, we were able to sit and enjoy lunch today. Because we were slack packing, I made myself a Turkey and cheese on a sesame seed bagel and packed it out for lunch. It was a nice treat from my typical tuna packet on a tortilla wrap. 
The miles seemed to go by pretty quickly, before we knew it we were at our pickup location. 
For most of the day, my foot felt good. The last few miles, again, on the downhills, the pain intensified.

In addition to the heat, a very rocky trail was today’s challenge. Instead of getting frustrated, upset or unhappy with the 3 miles of less than ideal trail, I turned a negative into a positive and chose to view my less than ideal situation as an opportunity to work on my balancing skills!

We had 15+ miles, the day started with a climb as most days do. 2 miles up, we were graced with a gradual grade and a smooth trail softened by pine needles. 
We hiked up and over the first mountain then stopped near Trout Creek for lunch. I enjoyed an Italian sub I had packed out then crossed the wooden footbridge to soak me feet in the creek. 
After taking my shoes and socks off, getting my feet in, I started walking in the creek towards a big rock that I intended to sit on for a while. That’s when I spotted a thick snake wrapped around the sapling tree next to the rock I was heading for. I think we surprised each other. I let him be, moved quickly to shore where I put my socks and shoes back on and headed up the trail. I don’t know what species it was, Insight thinks it may have been a Copperhead or a water snake, either way, the ability to identify snakes that are venomous from those that are not, would prove very useful out here. I’ll work on that!
The second half of the day was more challenging than the morning. Another several mile climb up, but this time it was steep and rocky. Slow going in fact. Once we reached the ridge, we were rewarded with some spectacular views. 
We reached Dragon’s Tooth just after 4 p.m. The tooth is an iconic landmark on the trail here in Virginia. It’s a very tall, steep, jagged rock formation that I imagine someone at one time thought it resembled a Dragon’s tooth, thus earning the name.  
After a few photos, we headed out to finish the last 2.5 miles of our day. We were all tired. After lunch, our beautiful smooth trail had turned much more challenging with rock climbs and lots of rock ledges. Thinking about where to place your feet with each step not only exhausts the body but also the mind. 
Slackpacking the last four days has given us an opportunity to push some pretty big back to back miles. Tonight, we hiked into Four Pines Hostel, here we will stay the night and hike out tomorrow.

I was awake before any of the others, so as not to a wake the other hikers, I went outside to make a cup of coffee. There are a plethora of birds running around the grounds at the hostel. Chickens, roosters, new guinea hens and ducks. It didn’t matter the early hour of the morning, they all had a LOT to say. I enjoyed my coffee to the sounds of their choir and watched them scurry about.

By the light of my headlamp and the partial moon, I hiked the mile and a half up to the infamous McAfee Knob hoping to get there in time to catch the sunrise. I made it! It was spectacular, magical even. This is one of the spots I was most looking forward to, it did not disappoint. 
McAfee Knob is the most photographed spot on the entire Appalachian Trail, I understand why. 
I spent about two hours there this morning, watching the sun paint the sky colors of orange and yellow and taking some pretty awesome photos. 
Because I was on trail so early, I hadn’t had coffee or breakfast, so I enjoyed it on the knob before finally heading on. 
I also got to hike Tinker Cliffs today. Now I have completed what they call the Virginia Triple Crown. Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. All part of the AT, but also popular destination hikes here in Virginia. 
Tinker Cliffs were amazing as well. Maybe even better than McAfee. I think it was the sunrise that made McAfee so special, but Tinker Cliffs was a wonderful place to hangout and take in the view as well. 
I met and also had a nice conversation with the Prouty Family (they were out on a weekend hike) while I was sitting on the cliffs enjoying the day, waiting for Insight and Carebear, who where a few hours behind me. They had no desire to get up at such an early hour this morning to hike up to the Knob.
Once they arrived, we had lunch together, taking time to enjoy the view.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637710,"I said goodbye to Insight and Carebear today. The decision to leave them did not come easily. I love my friends, but realize the time had come for me to push on. I want to challenge myself, push myself, see what I’m truly capable of. It’s not possible when hiking with others. Compromises are made. Taking into consideration what works for everyone in the group, you can only go as far and as fast as those in the group are capable of or will to do. 
The three of us left Stanimals Hostel together this morning. We were shuttled to Rock Fish Gap where we had gotten off the day before.  A quarter mile up the trail, we had to fill out our Shenandoah National Park permits. 
There is 103 miles of Appalachian Trail that goes through the park. Today we entered the southern border. 
I hiked until noon with my friends. At the shelter 8 miles in, where they planned to stay the night, we said goodbye. We promised to keep in touch, I hiked away as the tears filled my eyes and rolled down my cheeks. I will miss them both. 
Hike your own hike is a saying used out here quite often. Today is the day I began to hike my own hike. 
I hiked another 13 miles after leaving them and arrived at Black Rock Hut as they call them in the SNP. It’s no hut, just the same 3 sided shelter like the rest of them have been. 
Rolly, Steamboat & Moxie, who I had met at the hostel the night before, were all at the shelter when I arrived. It was nice to see some familiar faces. Especially now that I’m alone. 
It was just after 6 p.m. when I arrived.  20.6 miles total today, by longest day since I’ve gotten back on trail. 
My body feels tired now, and I’m ready for sleep.","Rock Fish Gap/Stanimals Hostel

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637711,"I got an early start this morning, 6:30 a.m., and I was on trail. With 20+ miles as my goal today, I wanted to give myself as many daylight hours as possible. I like hiking in the mornings, before the heat of the day sets in, when the forest is just waking up. It’s my favorite time of day and my most enjoyable time to be on trail. 
The Shanandoah Mountains are beautiful. The trail running through the park is well maintained and well groomed. The terrain is fairly gentle, however, there are still lots of elevation changes. Nothing is easy out here, everything is relative. 
The trail crosses Skyline Drive several time a day. SNP is known for its Waysides and for a hiker, they are a luxury. Having access to food and supplies just about every day is much appreciated and much enjoyed! 
At 8 miles into my day today, I took the side trail 100 yards to the Loft Mountain Campstore. There, I picked up Resupply for another few days and bought two hard boiled eggs, two cheddar cheese sticks and a chocolate milk. It was only 10 a.m. so I called it second breakfast. 
Rolly, Surplus, Steamboat & Moxie were there when I arrived, I joined them at the picnic table in the back of the store. TP arrived shortly after and joined our group as well. 
This is my second day in a row doing over 20 miles. The last mile and a half was a struggle for me, though I still made it to camp by 5 p.m.
I like getting to camp around that time. It still gives me time to set up my tent, do my camp chores, cook and eat dinner then crawl into my tent to plan the next day and write my journal entry. 
I’m in my tent tonight, set up in the woods kind of far from the shelter. All the closer spots were already taken when I got here. I don’t mind really, I won’t be hearing the noice from other hikers as they toss and turn in the middle of the night.","Black Rock Hut

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637713,"Another big mile day here in the Shenandoah National Park. I have to say, it has been one of my favorite places to hike through. Not only are the views pretty spectacular, but there are waysides and camp stores so conveniently located, just a few miles off trail. I have stopped at two so far, one yesterday, one today. 
I hiked with TP all day today. We met at the shelter the night before and became fast friends. 
TP is a firefighter from Maryland, he is out here doing all 103 miles of the Shanandoah National Park. 
I really enjoyed his company today. Talking was a great distraction from all the miles. 
Lewis Mountain Camp Ground is right off the trail. TP and I stopped at the camp store, bought a pack of hotdogs and a bag of buns. At the picnic table just outside the store, we cooked up all 8 dogs in our camp pot and devoured them in minutes! And as if that wasn’t amazing enough, the camp store was offering free ice cream to any thru-hiker that came through. A trail angel had come into the store earlier today and paid for thru-hiker ice creams.  It was a wonderful surprise and  most definitely appreciated. 
Lewis Mountain Camp Ground is a great little spot here in the SNP. I hope to return here someday in the future with Tom and rent a cabin for a few days. I plan to pay it forward with the ice cream gift. 
TP and I are camping at Big Meadows Camp Ground tonight. Big Meadows is another campground just off the AT. Like Lewis Mountain Camp Ground, it has no affiliation with the AT. These both are car camping campgrounds but will allow hikers to pitch their tents for a small fee. 
We chose to camp here tonight because TP had a Resupply box sent here and he had to come pick it up. Also, we had hiked 20.9 miles and were ready to be done for the day.

We were both happy about the short day after pushing some pretty big miles for the last three days. 
About seven miles in, we stopped at Elkwallow Wayside. Unfortunately, the Grill had a sign saying they would be opening on May 28. We were a week to early and were unable to get the cheese burger and milkshake I had dreamed about the night before. 
The camp store was however, open. I bought 2 cheese sticks, hummus with pretzels, a pre-made ham sandwich and a juice. I later went back in for an ice cream.
We filled our water bottles, charged our devices, dumped the trash we had been carrying and used the facilities. The simple pleasures of washing my hands with hot water and soap!
It was just after 3 p.m. when we arrived at camp. We quickly set up our tents and settled in. I was happy to arrive a little early after the last 3 long days.
When we arrived, there was a father and son here. The son, 18, who now goes by the trail name Project, is out here doing a month long hike for his senior project. His mom hiked the first week with him, his brother the second, dad is here for the third and will go home tomorrow, then, for the last week, he has a friend joining him. I enjoyed talking with him and love the idea of his school doing this. When he returns after his month is done, he will write a report, then give a presentation on his chosen life experience to a board of 30 people. 
As the evening went on, many more hikers arrived. I was so happy to see Snorzilla again. I hadn’t seen him since Bear Gardens. Unique and Smiles came in as well. The last time I saw them was at Angels Rest. Nana is a section hiker. I met Doc tonight and there is a church group of 8 women who are camping here too. It’s a full house for sure. The most people at one shelter that I’ve seen since I started the trail last March. 
Tomorrow I say good to TP. He will have finished his section hike through the SNP. I’m sad to see him go. I’m grateful our paths crossed and the trail brought us together, even if it was only for a few days. I’ve enjoyed hiking with him. I believe I’ve been blessed with another new friend. 
Tomorrow, we will hike the 13 miles out of the park and into Front Royal together where his girlfriend Katie will pick him up. They have offered to give me a ride to the Stumbler’s Inn Hostel.","Pass Mountain Hut

Six hikers were staying were in the shelter last night, Smiles and Glen were already up, the others were still sleeping. 
After 2 cups of coffee and a protein bar for breakfast, I said goodbye to the others, TP and I hit the trail for our 13 mile hike out to Front Royal. 
We arrived at our pickup location about 45 minutes early. It was hot and muggy, and I was just happy to be done hiking. We sat on the ground, in the shade, under the cover of a tree, road side and waited for Katie. 
She had called TP and asked if we wanted anything from Burger King, she would be happy to pick it up on her way. I hadn’t even met here yet, I already loved her!
Stumbler’s Inn Hostel is only a 15 minute drive from the trail head. The owners, Dave & Danielle (they are previous 2018 thru-hikers) who moved here to Front Royal, VA after the completion of their hike. They have a beautiful home and have turned the lower level into a hostel. The hostel has just opened this year. It is by far, the nicest, cleanest, well thought out hostel I have stayed at thus far in all my time on trail. The only thing that could make it better would be if it was in walking distance to town. A shuttle is needed if you want town food, Resupply food, really everything. They do offer rides into town in the evenings for dinner, etc. 
When I arrived here, Roly, Lighter and Excel were here. It’s always great to see familiar faces! I introduced them to TP & Katie who were staying long enough for TP to take a quick shower before driving home. I then settled in for the night.","Gravel Springs Hut

Breakfast is served at 7:30. I joined Roly, Lighter and Excel for a feast of scrambled eggs, hashbrowns casserole and biscuits and gravy then said goodbye to all three them. They are getting back on trail. I’m taking a zero.
Shortly after they left, Doc arrived. I had met the Doc the night before at Gravel Spring Hut. 
Around noon, Danielle drove us into town. I went to the local Outfitters and bought a new pair of shoes. My Topos that were brand new when I got back on trail in March, had nothing left to them. I tried getting a new pair online but they are not available anywhere until sometime in June. The Outfitter did not carry the Topos, so I ended up getting Altras. They are similar, with a wide toe box, so I’m hoping I like them as much. I should know in a few days if they are going to work as well for me. Fingers crossed. 
After my shoe purchase, I went to a quiet coffee house on Main St., ordered a sub with hummus and all kinds of vegetables and a piña colada smoothie then headed over to Martins, the local grocery store to get my Resupply for the next stretch to Harpers Ferry, WV.","Stumbler’s Inn Front Royal, Virginia

I planned a fifteen and a half mile day to Whiskey Hollow Shelter, given my later start, I expected to be there by five. 
Today however, I arrived at camp at 3 p.m. Definitely sooner than I had expected. The terrain was relatively nice, I felt strong and rested after my zero day and with the rain, I was motivated to move quickly. 
The weather started out misty this morning, heavier rain came around noon, quickly, I was wet through. 
Given the early hour, I would have loved to push a few more miles, however, the only place to camp if I went past the shelter, was a tent sight, I had no desire to set up my tent in the rain, so I settled in. 
This shelter is probably the nicest shelter I’ve stayed at. There is room for a least 15. It has a loft with a great ladder and a pretty impressive porch with a bench on two sides and a picnic table. It’s a wonderful refuge from the rain that continues to fall as I’m writing this.

About a half hour on trail, I crossed paths with a man hiking southbound. He stopped to chat, and I learned he had just retired and was out hiking a section of the trail. He told me his name was Obsessed, because he is obsessed with thru-hikers, he then reached in his fanny pack, pulled out a 20 dollar bill and told me to he’d like to by me lunch. This community is amazing, and I have been blessed with gifts of generosity and kindness in many forms. 
Shortly after I stopped to talk with Obsessed, Gigi, one of the women who I had stayed at the shelter with last night, came up the trail behind me. We ended up hiking the whole day together. It was wonderful to chat the miles away getting to know her. She is amazing, and full of so much energy. At 68, she is out here crushing miles! I had a hard time keeping up with her by the end of the day. 
My plan was 15.6 miles to the Sam More shelter, though I ended up pushing another 3 miles to the Bears Den Hostel with Gigi where for $35 we got a bunk, shower, washed our laundry, a pizza, soda and a pint of ice cream!

I decided the better thing to do would be to push 21 miles into Harpers Ferry and get a bunk at the Town Inn. 
I had about 5 miles of the roller coaster left, after that, the terrain turned relatively flat, and I knew I could make it into Harpers Ferry, though it would be after 6 p.m., I would be out of the woods and dry for the night.
Along with Gigi, I also hiked today with Silver Goat. This morning, the three of us crossed the state line into WV. It was a great feeling to finally be out of Virginia! We did a little celebration dance at the sign crossing and pushed on. 
By 2 p.m., we reached Keys Gap. Silver Goat’s wife was at the Gap with cold sodas and snacks. With 6 more miles to go, the sodas and snacks really helped revive me, and I made it into Harpers Ferry by 6 p.m.
Shortly after our stop at Keys Gap, thunderstorms rolled in and the rain began. It came down heavy, soaked everything for about an hour, then stopped and the sun returned. With it, so did the humidity. 
I said goodbye to Silver Goat at the bridge coming into Harpers Ferry, his wife was picking him up, they were getting a hotel room for the night. Gigi and I said goodbye shortly after. She was getting picked up at The ATC Headquarters by a friend and spending the night with her. Her husband was also expected to arrive on Friday, when she would take a few days off. 
I’m staying at the Town Inn. There were no bunks available when I arrived, but they set up a pad on the floor in the common area. I’ll take it. I was just happy to get out of my wet, muddy clothes and take a shower. 
I then ran across the street to the only place in town that was still open for food and ordered a chicken, bacon,ranch sub and a caesar salad to go. By the time it was ready, the severe storm that had been predicted, was raging outside. Buckets of rain flooded the streets, along with thunder and lightning, the wind blew over anything that wasn’t tied down. 
I made a mad dash with my dinner in hand, across the street and up the stairs to the hostel. The only dry clothes I had, were now soaking wet. 
I was hungry and tired after pushing 21 miles. Sleep is all I want. Unfortunately, the others that are staying here tonight have different plans. The beers and whiskey are being passed around, conversation is loud and non-stop. 
I totally get that it’s a hostel and a shared space. If I want privacy and quite, I have the option to rent a private room. Every hostel, I’ve stayed in, hikers are generally in bed by 10 p.m., and that’s considered late. This group, sadly, has no consideration for anyone trying to sleep.

The Town Inn is also a Cafe. Karen, the woman who owns and operates it, is a bit eccentric. I definitely want to come back to Harpers Ferry again when I can spend more time here. The historic downtown is so quaint, filled with so much history, I want time to explore everything. 
I walked up to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and snapped a selfie in front of the building. It was 7 a.m. The Conservancy has been closed since last March, it was slated to open this morning at 9 a.m. There were many hikers excited to get a tag. I wasn’t waiting two hours for them to open. 
After going over the bridge, the first three miles, the trail followed a bike path along the Potomac river before crossing the railroad tracks and starting to climb in the woods.  
Within a and hour or so after leaving Harpers Ferry, I was in Maryland. Given the fact that WV has on 4 miles of trail. No state line sign, just a map at the trail head. It was definitely anti-climatic. 
I hiked alone all day today. Passing a few day hikers going southbound. My plan was to camp at Rocky Run Shelter about 15 miles in. It was only 2:30 when I arrived at the shelter, so I decided to push on a few more miles. I’m definitely happy I did. 
I’m camping tonight at Dahlgren Backpackers Campground. It’s a large state-run campground with gravel tent pads, hammock sites, trash cans, bear poles and bear boxes. A shower house with showers and flushing toilets. Water is also available from a utility sink! It is by far a luxury!

We hope to reconnect in a few days when we start Pennsylvania.
I hiked through Washington Monument State Park this morning. I was on trail early, there was not a soul in the park. I had the place to myself. The original Washington Monument, built in 1827, sits at the top of the mountain and now serves as the centerpiece for a Maryland State Park near Boonsboro, MD. I must confess, I did not know that the more famous one in Washington DC was not the original. Now I know. 
I want to return to the WV/MD area to spend more time exploring. There is so much history here, I would love to learn more about. Sadly, I have to keep moving, I’m here to hike. I will return to learn, someday soon. 
I pushed hard today to beat the rain and arrived 14 miles later at Cowall Shelter. It was only 12 o’clock. Too early to stop for the day.

I know I will yearn for the trail once it is all over, however, what was supposed to be a 6 month journey, March to September 2020, has turned into nearly 15 months due to, well... a world wide pandemic that will go down in history as COVID-19, the virus that stopped the world from turning.

We had a plan to hike the 17 miles into Pine Grove Furnace County Store and partake in the Half Gallon Challenge. It’s a well known, right of passage out here on trail. You attempt to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one hour, if you finish, you earn a wooden spoon and bragging rights, of course. The challenge is somewhat of a celebration for making it to the halfway point on the trail. 
Though it wasn’t the halfway point for me, I did partake in the challenge with my friends Gigi and I Spy, both are 2021 NOBO’s, and this is their half way point.

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638649,"A 17.5-mile day after a 25-mile day, and now my foot is acting up again. Maybe because of my new shoes, maybe because of the Pennsylvania rocks, maybe too many big miles, maybe all of the above. 
Tylenol doesn’t seem to help. I’ve tried rolling it on a cork ball, again not much help. Elevating when I can, but I know rest is really what it will take. 
I’ve decided I need to pull back and lower my miles a little again. I need to listen to my body while it’s whispering, before it starts screaming at me. I’m so close to the finish, I don’t want to be taken off trail this late in the game! 
Sadly, pulling back means leaving my new friends, Gigi and Road Runner. This time though, as sad as it will be, I know I will be okay to be my own again. 
Gigi, Road Runner, Just Joe and I are tenting in an unofficial campsite tonight, mostly because it’s by a spring. It’s not the most level place to camp, but it will do. 
Tomorrow, I will hike with Gigi and Road Runner for about 15 miles where I plan to camp, they will be pushing on.","Kind Of Outdoorsy Hostel, Duncannon PA

I arrived at the campsite by 2:30, said my goodbyes to the two wonderful women I had been hiking with for the last 4 days, set up my tent and crawled in. I needed to get off my feet and try to relieve the pain. 
It looks like I will be alone tonight. No one else has come, it’s nearly 6:30.","Tent sight

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638999,"I did indeed end up alone last night. I slept good and woke feeling rested. 
Getting to camp early yesterday and giving myself time off my feet really seemed to help. The pain in my foot was more tolerable today. 
I was on trail by 6:30. Wanted to get an early start, temperatures were predicted to be on the 90s. 
I took it slow and enjoyed the trail. Stopping to take photos of anything interesting along the way. 
At what’s called the Look Out, I stopped for a snack. Shortly after, Houdini, who I had met a few days prior, came by. He joined me for a break. He also had plans to camp at the 501 Shelter tonight as well. We hiked the rest of the day leap frogging each other, then walked into the shelter together. 
Edison, a hiker I had yet to meet, was there when we arrived. Houdini and I studied the takeout menu, finally calling the Pizza House to deliver our dinner to the shelter. 
The 501 Shelter is located about 0.2 miles off the AT on the north side of PA highway 501. It is an enclosed cabin with bunk space for 12. The cabin also has a nice skylight, common area, solar shower, privy, and water from a spigot. An Appalachian Trail caretaker lives next to the cabin and takes care of the area. Because of its close proximity to the highway, we were able to get delivery! Super bonus! 
I ordered a chicken parmesan sandwich, cheese fries and a Coca-Cola! Within a half hour, I had a dinner fit for a queen and a picnic table to eat it on! 
While I was there, Lighter, Roly Poly, I Spy and Just Scott arrived. All familiar faces I have hiked around and stayed in hostels with. 
By 4 o’clock, my stomach was sufficiently satisfied, I had rested for an hour and a half and decided to hike on a few more miles. The pain in my foot minimal. 
There were 3 campsite options, one in .6, one 3 miles and another 5.5 miles from the 501 shelter. 
I ended up hiking the 5.5 to the Hertline campsite. It was about 6:30 when I arrived. I made quick work of putting up my tent, hung my bear rope and crawled in my tent. 
My tent is set up next to a river with a waterfall, a swimming hole and a rope swing. Across the river, there is someone in a tent and a hammock set up as well.","Tent Sight

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639045,"With only a few miles to hike to RT 183 where Jody from Rock N Sole Hostel would pick me up, I was able to sleep in a little. I camped last night near a waterfall, it was so peaceful and relaxing, I took my time getting out of camp this morning. Enjoying the solitude. As I get closer to the finish, my head knows I will miss these days on trail, though my heart is longing to return home. I’m trying to live in the moment and saver my last 100 miles all at the same time, digging deep within to finish these remaining 100 miles. Honestly, home is where I want to be. 
By 10 a.m., I was at the hostel. I have the Bunkhouse to myself. No one else is here. I’m enjoying the privacy. 
The hostel sleeps 6. It’s owned by Craig & Jody and is basically a detached garage next to their house. They have turned the space into an adorable bunkhouse. It even has air conditioning, which is a welcome treat on this hot and humid day. There is an outdoor shower and sink, along with a outside sitting area they call the lounge. 
After settling in, I enjoyed a cool shower that felt truly amazing. Washing away the dirt and sweat of the last several days on trail. Around noon, Jody drove me to The Dollar Store where I resupplied for the next four days then we stopped at the Sunny Cupboard, a store and deli run by Mennonites, where I got a sandwich and a salad. 
While I relaxed after lunch, Jody even did my laundry! I debated whether or not to zero here tomorrow, but have decided to get back on trail in the morning. Given the fact that I had gotten here early this morning, I managed to get my Resupply, all my chores done and still had most of the day to rest my foot. While the break from hiking is good, I’m focused on the finish line.","Hertline Campsite

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639046,"Breakfast was served on the front porch. A table that sat four, complete with a cloth tablecloth. Though I was the only one there, I enjoyed a breakfast of coffee, orange juice, a fresh fruit cup and an egg, cheese and sausage sandwich. All were delicious, I felt pampered. 
By 8 a.m., I was on trail. Today was so hot and muggy. Within 10 minutes, I was dripping with sweat, my freshly laundered clothes soaked. 
I didn’t see a single person on trail all day today. There were no views, only woods and rocks. Around 1 o’clock, with about 2 miles left to get to Port Clinton, the skies darkened and thunder rumbled in the distance. I knew a storm was coming, and I pushed hard to make the miles, I wanted to get out of the woods and to the pavilion before the rain came. I knew the last mile was a very steep descent coming into town, I said a quick prayer that I would make it. I did. Ten minutes after I arrived, the rain came. 
The Port Clinton Pavilion is owned by the St. John Church. The town of Port Clinton allows hikers to use the large picnic pavilion on Penn Street for camping while passing through town. I’m happy to be here, the shelter from the rain is a gift. 
I’ve set my tent up inside the pavilion. There are several other hikers staying here, but there is plenty of room. 
Port Clinton is a small town. Port Clinton Post Office, Port Clinton Peanut Shop and Port Clinton Barber Shop make up the town. Additionally, there is a Port Clinton Restaurant, though it is not open today. 
I walked up to the Peanut Shop with Edison, another hiker staying here at the pavilion. The shop was amazing. A truly old fashion candy store! I bought a Coca a cola and three pieces of dark chocolate with coconut. We then stopped in the Barbershop to say hello to Frank. Frank is an interesting man who owns and operates the barbershop. Not only is it a barbershop, but an antique shop, a music venue and a local hangout. Frank has hiked the trail and welcomes hikers to come in and enjoy his air conditioning, use his bathroom, charge any devices, drink his coffee and listen to his stories. Such an interesting man, such an interesting place! 
Back at the pavilion, I cooked my dinner, conversed with the others for a little while then retired to my tent. 
My foot is sore from the steep descent. I’m hoping it feels better in the morning.
I’m not sure how much sleep I will get tonight. The pavilion is right between an active railroad and a highway, but I’m grateful for the shelter nevertheless.","Rock N Sole Hostel, Schuylkill Haven, PA

It’s so hot and muggy, the trail is nothing but rocks, and I’m so tired. Though the next words out of my mouth: I couldn’t live with myself if I went home now with only 70 miles from the finish. But, oh, how I’m ready to be finished. 
I’ve been asked more than once, what state have you liked the most? My answer, always has been, I’ve truly enjoyed each state for different reasons. They all have special qualities unique to them. Today though, I’ll add, except Pennsylvania. There is nothing in Pennsylvania I have enjoyed. Definitely my least favorite state.","Port Clinton PA Pavilion

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639175,"I’ve had a lot of time out here over these last several miles to reflect on my journey. I’ve learned a lot, especially about myself. The trail has also reinforced so many things I’ve already known. 
I’ve learned that I like my own company. 
I’ve learned am I okay being alone, I can survive, somedays, even thrive! 
I’ve learned that I’ve never felt closer to my dad than these months on trail. I’ve also learned that I never silently asked for his help, his strength, as much as I have in my time out here and though I’ve called on him multiple times, I’ve learned I am strong and capable of so much more then I ever dreamed I was. 
I’ve learned just how hard the trail can be, that it’s not all sunny days and beautiful views. It’s fighting freezing temperatures, being wet or hot, sweaty, filthy, smelly, sore and tired.  
I’ve learned there were days I needed to dig deep, and then dig even deeper. 
I’ve learned to listen to my body when it speaks to me. 
I’ve learned I appreciate my family more than ever. That I’m blessed to have a husband who supports my dreams and encourages me to go after them! I’ve learned absence really does make the heart grow fonder. 
I’ve learned I have the most wonderful, amazing and supportive friends ever! 
I’ve learned that the hiking community, is a kind, caring and giving group of people whose generosity goes above and beyond. I’ve been the recipient of so much kindness from complete strangers. 
I’ve learned 7 p.m. is like midnight out here on trail. 
I’ve learned I love waking up to the sound of the birds at 5 a.m. 
I learned I sleep better in my tent than in the shelters. 
I learned I can eat an entire half gallon of ice cream in less that an hour. 😉
I learned I’m pretty bad at throwing my bear rope, but a bear has yet to get my food. 
I learned if I always stay in my comfort zone, I’m not truly living. 
I’ve learned that after nearly 2,200 miles, I still continue to learn every day.","Eckville Shelter

Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639176,"I camped alone again last night in a nice spot, out of sight from the trail. The Bake Oven Nob Shelter was very old, neglected and run down. Additionally, there was a large bees nest, hanging from the ceiling. The only reason I considered sleeping there was because it was supposed to rain. 
I woke at 5 a.m., packed up and hit the trail. I had close to 8 miles to hike to the road, and the trail was crazy rocky. With the rain, the trail would be slow going. Treacherous even. 
I moved slowly across the field of bolders, watching carefully each step I took. My only thoughts were I don’t want to get hurt this late in the game and not be able to finish the trail. 
At the George W. Outerbridge Shelter about 6 miles in, I stopped and made coffee and ate a breakfast bar then hiked the remaining few miles into Palmerton. 
Tracy was supposed to pick me up and drive me into town, however, when I texted her to let her know I was out of the woods, she told me her car was in the shop. I ended up asking a guy who was unloading his truck at ABC AC Repair Shop. He kindly obliged. 
I’m staying at Bert’s Hostel. It’s in the back of Bert’s Steakhouse. It’s a full house of 6 here tonight. I met a nice woman around my age. Her name is Somewhere. I could see us being great friends, great trail buddies, if I wasn’t finishing in 3 days. Nevertheless, I’m happy our paths have crossed. 
I think one of the things I’ve loved most about this trail is the opportunity it’s given me to meet many different people. People from all over, people of all ages, races, sexual orientations, beliefs. People I would never, ever have become friends with, much less have a conversation with, if it wasn’t for this  trail. Out here, it doesn’t matter who you are, what your occupation is/was; out here, we are all just hikers. Hikers with the same goal, going through the same struggles and the same celebrations.
With only three days left before I reach Delaware Water Gap and complete the trail, I have so many emotions. I’m sure in time, with some reflection, I will be able to put them to paper. For now, they remain swirling in my head.","Bake Oven Shelter

The climb out of Palmerton is referred to as the prelude for the Whites. I’ve hiked the Whites, it was definitely reminiscent! A total boulder climb. Hand over hand. 
Shortly after we got through Leigh High Gap, I hiked on ahead. My goal was to camp at Leroy Smith Shelter. Somewhere was going to try to make it to the shelter as well. It’s nearly 8 p.m., she has yet to arrive. I’m sure she is okay, maybe just got tired and camped short of the shelter. I hope. 
There were lots of other hikers on trail today. Funny, other days you don’t see a soul.
At Smith’s Gap, 4 miles before my destination, I experienced the most amazing trail magic. Hot dogs, sandwiches, chips, salad, fruit, donuts, soda, coffee and more! Just another display of the continual generosity from complete strangers out here on trail. I sat, rested and refueled along with several other hikers. 
With renewed energy, I pushed on the 4 miles to the shelter. A sandwich and a bag of chips in my pack to be consumed as my dinner. 
I’m camping in a large tent sight near the shelter. There are about 10 other hikers here. I plan on sleeping in a little later tomorrow morning. Maybe taking a little extra time at camp as well.

I’m in my tent for the last time as I write this. I’m filled with so many emotions. Right now, it doesn’t even seem possible that I have hiked 2,200 miles, through 14 states, and tomorrow, I will have achieved a life long dream of mine.

",Kirkridge Shelter ,"Jun 13, Sun",13.70
Carolyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641091,"I’m writing this journal entry one month and four days after completing the trail.  I made a promise to myself that while on trail, I would keep a journal. I promised every night I would write about the events in my day or my feelings pertaining to the day. It didn’t have to be exceptionally long or detailed. It could be as simple as, it’s been a hard day, to tired to journal tonight, tomorrow is a new day, but I wanted to put something down on paper each and every day. Keeping a journal would be a way for me to remember, reflect and preserve this amazing adventure, mostly for me, though I wanted to share it with my family and friends who were so very excited and supportive. And if someday, I am blessed with grandchildren, even great grandchildren, I hope they will view it as a gift. 
So while on trail I did just that, writing 228 entries for every day I was on trail. However, when it came to the last day, the day I completed the trail, I didn’t journal that night. 
Not because the day wasn’t noteworthy.  It was a wonderful day! The sun was shining as I hiked the last six miles of Pennsylvania, over the Delaware River Bridge, to the New Jersey state line. Standing on that bridge, I join the ranks of others who had come before me, enduring all 2,193.1 miles of the Appalachian Trail and officially became a thru-hiker. And though finishing on the Delaware River Bridge at the Pennsylvania/New Jersey line is not the traditional, epic finish at the summit sign on top of Katahdin, my day was made extremely special by Mudcrack, my old hiking buddy who drove all the way to Delaware Water Gap to celebrate my finish! It meant the world to me. That night over dinner, we reminisced about all the miles we shared on trail hiking through Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. We talked about his hike after we said goodbye in Vermont and about his finish two days before Christmas in 2020. We talked about our struggles and recalled the times we thought of quitting. We talked about our best days on trail, the days when we were the happiest. 
Together we raised a glass, or three😉, in celebration, for only someone who has shared the trail truly can understand the magnitude of the accomplishment. 
I didn’t journal that night. I felt like I was expected to write something profound because I had finished the trail and accomplished my goal. Tell how my life had changed or how I was different somehow etc, etc. No pressure there... right. So days passed, I wrote nothing. 
Then a friend asked me if I was going to write about my final day. He was waiting for the ending. He said he read my journals every day and it felt like I ripped the last page out of my book. 
I laughed at the idea of that, but it made me realize that I needed to complete the last entry and close “my book.”
So today, still no profound statement or poetic words come to me. Though I believe the trail has changed me, making me want to try to live more as I lived on trail- simply, consciously, deliberately, with curiosity for each new day and being comfortable with uncertainty, with more tolerance, more kindness and less judgment appreciating people for who they are, with understanding and with great appreciation for the many things I once took for granted.","Kirkridge Shelter
