Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625278,"This is a shared journal that we will be using to document the hike that my wife Deb (Yonder) and I (Further) plan to start in late April of 2020. We will be part of the “older” crew out on the trail but from what I’ve seen we will have lots of other old geezers out there to keep us company. Things have changed a lot since the mid-70’s when I first discovered the trail and vowed to hike it someday. One thing that has not changed is my desire to hike it. Life may have gotten in the way for awhile but we are now finally able to do this.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625296,"In 1975, when I was 12 years old, my friend Steve and I somehow convinced our parents to let us hike sections of the Long Trail in Vermont. Two 12 year olds fending for themselves alone in the woods. It was awesome. We would go out for 4 or 5 days at a time with packs that were much heavier than what I hike with now as a full grown adult. I have a very distinct memory around this time of meeting an AT thru-hiker at Stratton Pond who told us he had just walked from Georgia. My little 12 year old mind was blown and the idea of hiking the trail took hold right then and there.
About 10 years after those formative years on the trail I got together with Yonder. Our first “thru-hike” together was the Chilkoot Trail in Alaska. It was only about 35 miles and just a few days on the trail but it was enough to hook Yonder on this whole backpacking thing and in the process I found a hiking partner for life.

Since then we have gone on many more hikes together and completed several sections of the AT as well. But after every trip we were left wanting more. It’s time for more.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625308,"A few years back we found ourselves in an empty nest situation with both our kids being away at college. Suddenly we were free again and the idea of hiking the AT came right back to us. We got back out on the trail again and slowly upgraded our circa 1970’s gear and replaced everything with newer and lighter equipment. After a few years of this we realized that we weren’t getting any younger and the sections we had been hiking seemed to be getting harder. If we were to wait until we were both comfortably retired this might not happen. Nope, we need to do this now.
So the plan is to commit career suicide by quitting our jobs and hitting the trail. I will be 57 and Yonder will be (gulp) 60. Not really old geezers just yet but not exactly spring chickens either.

To keep in shape for hiking over the last several years we have also gotten into distance running. Through our running club we have secured entries into the 2020 Boston Marathon on April 20th. Because of this we will be starting our hike a week later on April 27th which is later than most. Hopefully the training for Boston will have us in great shape for hiking (assuming the race itself will not beat us up too much). We think that the timing for this will actually work in our favor because it will keep us away from the colder temps and it should also be less crowded on the trail by then. The drawback to this plan is that it will only allow us a little more than 5 months to get to Katahdin before they close it down for the season. This may not be an issue for us though as we may very well skip over some or all of the sections that we have already hiked (Shenandoah, MD, NY, CT, MA, VT and NH). Whether or not to skip sections is something we will have to figure out during the hike. It’s a long way from Springer to Shenandoah so it will give us plenty of time to decide before we are faced with that first choice of skipping a section. And we know the stats about most hikers not finishing and many not even making it past Georgia so we’ll see what happens. We think we can do this but we also know that all it takes is one bad step for plans to change. If that happens so be it but we’ll never know until we try and we are so excited to try!

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626139,"We are now 11 weeks away from our start date and have begun to feel the urgency to step up our planning. Somehow, after 45 years of thinking about this adventure, I suddenly feel like we do not have enough time to properly plan this thing!
We are both going back and forth on what footwear to go with, which sleeping bags, what clothing, mail drops or no mail drops and on and on. But the good news is that some of the more important things have started to fall into place... 
Someone has agreed to rent our house for five full months! This is a huge relief and the part of the plan that we hadn’t fully figured out before committing to this. If we had to continue paying the mortgage for the entire time we will be away we would definitely be broke by the time we got to Maine. Now we will have most of our fixed costs taken care of which will allow us to spend more money while we are hiking (side note: we plan to hit every craft brewery located near the trail along the entire way). Also, we will no longer have the option to come running home the minute things start getting hard since there will already be people living in our house.

We have decided to splurge the night before we hit the trail and will be staying at Amicalola Lodge which we have already reserved. Even better we will have some friends driving up from Florida to pick us up from the airport and bring us to Amicalola. They have even agreed to drive us up to the trailhead on Springer Mt the next morning and will hike the first couple of miles with us.

Another thing to report is that we have already started getting offers of trail magic! Last week we met a former thru hiker who lives near the trail in Pennsylvania who has offered to pick us up and bring us to her home when we are passing by her area. 
There are still more logistics to work out (anyone want to watch our cat for 5 or 6 months?) but we are getting closer to figuring it all out and this is definitely going to happen.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627576,"Well, I guess it’s time for one of these updates from us. We have decided to heed the ATC’s warnings and stay off trail until further notice. Our original start date of April 28th is not going to happen. We were in the denial stage for quite awhile on this but when our friends called us to let us know that they would not be shuttling us from the airport to Springer we finally accepted the truth. This thru hike will have to be postponed and may not even be able to happen. It’s a small problem compared to what the world as a whole is going through right now but it’s not easy seeing a lifelong dream slip away.
We are now taking things day by day. Both our jobs have allowed us to stay on past our original leaving dates and we are now working from home and still getting paid. Another bit of good news is that our renters have agreed to hold off for a month and will not move in until June 1st. Of course this could also be considered bad news if the trail does not open up by June, not only will our hike still be postponed but we will also be homeless!

Right now we are hoping for the best and have set a new date of May 29th as our official start. I have changed our reservation at the Amicalola Lodge and can hopefully get our airline reservation changed as well. The way things are going this may still be too soon but this is what we are working with for now. Plan B is to do some kind of section hike routine or find another trail to hike that will be less impacted by these virus concerns. Clearly our plan B could use some work. If anyone has any ideas please feel free to share.

One thing that has become clear is that we will not be doing a traditional thru hike starting from Springer and passing every white blaze to Katahdin. We were already questioning if we should hike the sections that we have already completed and now it is clear that we won’t. This still leaves about two thirds of the trail to finish but if we are able to start on May 29th I think we can do it. 
So there is still hope for an epic adventure on the AT in 2020 for Further & Yonder. It will just be a little different than expected.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628417,"We have decided to pull the plug on this year’s thru hike plans - Yonder really needs to be here for her job and the people who were supposed to rent our house had to pull out of the agreement. All of this along with the ATC still wanting thru hikers to stay off the trail made it clear to us that this wasn’t meant to be for 2020. That’s the bad news.
The good news is that we are both still employed and we will not be homeless while we wait for the trail to open up. The better news is that things actually are starting to open up and we will soon be back on trail for a section hike! 
Our new plan is to do a smaller section hike this year starting on June 13th and then we’ll try the longer hike starting from Springer next April. We both have a lot of vacation time built up so we’ll be able to take 3 weeks and still get a pretty good hike in this year despite all the pandemic craziness. We’ve decided to tackle the rocks of Pennsylvania. If they are as tough as everyone says they are it will be nice to get them out of the way and be able to skip over them next year.

Hopefully the next time we make an entry in this journal it will be from on the trail and not another one of these “change in plans” entries.

Luckily we reached Pine Grove Furnace where Jeremy had his car parked so we were able to drive to the closest Walmart and buy a new pad. So instead of the super lightweight comfortable pad that rolled up to the size of a Poland Spring bottle I now have this giant roll up foam pad hanging off the outside of my pack driving me crazy and it’s not even that comfortable. Hopefully we can find a better solution later on down the trail. The good thing about this though was that the Walmart was back by the campground where Jeremy and Tim were now at so we decided to stay there for the night and take advantage of the free showers before heading back to Pine Grove Furnace to resume our hike.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628657,"Today we had our first really hard rain of the trip. Prior to this it had only rained at night while we were dry in our tent. We definitely weren’t dry today though and we could have avoided it by staying at a hostel in Boiling Springs but decided to forge ahead and stay at a hotel that was offering a hiker discount so we could get our own room for less money. This also allowed us to take our third shower in 7 days which is probably a lot more often than most AT hikers and a trend that we hope to continue if possible. 
Today’s picture is from a trail magic break provided by Jeff from Ohio. Zoom and Garlic joined us.
I had become very aggravated with the giant blue sleep pad hanging on the outside of my pack so was very happy to discover an outfitter in Boiling Springs where we were able to get a better quality pad that actually fit in my pack. This proved very timely since my pack cover was not large enough to keep everything dry when the Walmart pad was strapped on and things would have gotten very wet if I had to keep carrying it. Instead, once I got the new pad the $9 Walmart pad was left in the hiker box at the ATC center for the next hiker desperate enough to need it. 
We also enjoyed a great lunch at the 101 Cafe before heading out for what turned out to be a very wet last few hours of hiking.

Luckily for us this coincided with some of the flattest section of trail we have seen so far. Without actually running we were able to average about a 19 minute mile or about 3 miles an hour. Typically we have been averaging closer to 2 miles an hour including all of our stops of which there are usually many.
Later in the day we had to cross some fields that had clearly not been maintained in quite some time which was a bit challenging as we got lost in a sea of tall grass. As far as we can tell we managed to make it through tick free though.~Further","Carlisle, PA

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628964,"Today we left a stealth campsite with a view, really nice, and hiked down into Lehigh Gap to the Lehigh River - saw some Pennsylvania Amish young folks who were going out hiking, and crossed the river bridge.  It was very loud and busy with the trucks and cars whizzing by on the roads, felt glad to cross the streets and head back into the woods.  We had considered going into Palmerton, a nearby town, for phone charging, etc., but with the noise, and the feeling that we still had good energy, went upward to tackle the climb out of Lehigh Gap heading north.  It was definitely up, which is tiring, but also feels good.  The trail eventually opened up to a giant boulder rock field - we had wondered what this would be like - there were warnings about using an alternate trail in bad weather.  Again, it was challenging, with balancing and climbing involved, but also satisfying.  For me, it was just challenging enough, until we got to a couple of spots where I surrendered my poles, had to boost up to climb sideways and up across a rock face placing my boots in crevices to keep going - a little scary with the heavy pack.  Further thought this whole boulder section was the best part of the hike, of course!  :-)  After getting to the top, we began traversing a long ridge with just slight ups and downs.  It was a strangish landscape - this mountain was used as a Zinc smelting location and was a environmental disaster when the smelting stopped in the 1980s (it was a Superfund site with federal cleanup).  The top of the mountain seems to have recovered but with different flora.
We stopped at a meadow area with a view for breakfast, saw Badass Bean and Captain Hook pass by - they were slackpacking that day.  Later we saw them again sitting at a table, feet up, partaking in trail magic soda and chips from Iceman, who generously offered the same to us.  We aired our boots and feet, had a cold drink and delicious salty chips, filled our water bottles, thanked Iceman and moved on (his generosity was so appreciated!).  The next Shelter was a bit too far for us, these ones are quite far apart, like 19 miles, so found a campsite near Delps trail and called it a day.

We needed to charge our phones, clean up, do laundry and eat some real food, so were determined to get to Wind Gap and get off trail for a town visit.  Stopped at Leroy Smith shelter (with still 9 miles to go) and had breakfast, it was sunny and hot, stayed in the shaded shelter.  Thought we might stay at a motel, but could not get through to anyone.  
Finally arrived at Wind Gap, with the trail dropping us onto a busy, loud road, walked to the motel.  The owner was not there, a resident showed us a room, but we decided to walk into town instead to the laundromat.  We were able to charge phones, clean dishes and wash up at the laundromat (it was nice and clean) and had loads of iced tea and  pizza at a pub across the street.  Fortified, we charged up (ha ha, nope, we actually slowly walked - it was hot!) the hill to the trailhead, and then up out of the gap to a stealth campsite.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631338,"Seven weeks after leaving trail we found ourselves following the white blazes again, this time up to the top of Mt Madison in the Whites. Our son Jeremy, newly christened with trail name “Bogs”, joined his friend for a few days hiking SOBO from Grafton Notch to Gorham and needed a ride back to his car. Using this as our excuse Yonder and I loaded up the packs and headed north. We picked up Bogs from the Rattle River Hostel and shuttled him back to his car in Grafton Notch hearing all about his adventures from the last few days including descending the Mahoosic Arm in a rain storm and crawling through the Mahoosic Notch. From there we quickly got back to a trailhead off Rt 16 in NH that was only a few miles from the Osgood tentsite which we arrived at just as it was getting dark.

Being back in our tent in the woods was awesome! We both had our best nights of sleep in weeks, so much so that we didn’t start hiking until very late the next morning which turned out to be a bit of a mistake as we managed to do our typical arriving back in the dark routine after what we thought was going to be a short day.

The hike up Osgood trail to the top of Madison was a steep one and we could see why many of the thru hikers complained about going down it. Shortly after going above tree line some dark clouds quickly moved in and the temperature dropped about 20 degrees and the rain started coming down. Suddenly there were no views and we were questioning how smart it would be to continue. Luckily we had most of our stuff with us in our packs with the exception of our tent which we had left setup at the campsite so we figured we would be OK and forged on. As we got closer to the summit the clouds started to disappear and the sun came out along with the views. It was great to be back on top of the Presidentials again!

From Madison we started down the other side to grab a quick lunch at Madison Spring Hut where we heard they were selling food though they were not fully open for people to stay due to COVID restrictions. This is where the day started getting hard as neither one of us move very fast going down. The plan was to stop at the hut and then move onto the summit of nearby Adams but shortly after arriving at the hut the skies opened up again and more rain dumped down. The timing was great because we were able to run into the hut and wait out the rain while eating one of the delicious burritos they were selling.

Once the rains let up we headed back out on the trail again but it was becoming clear that we would not be summiting Adams today which was covered in a dark black cloud that wasn’t going away anytime soon. Plus it looked like more storms coming our way so it was time to head back down off the ridge. And this is when we got stupid.

We meant to ask the crew at the hut about some of the other trails going back down to make sure we didn’t choose anything crazy. We had heard that Madison Gulf trail was insane (one of my original plans) so luckily we avoided that one but we still managed to make a terrible choice for our way back down. Instead of going back up and over Madison I had the bright idea of taking a cutover trail that went around and was supposedly slightly shorter. My thinking was that this would lessen the risk of being up top if another storm rolled in. As it turns out it only sprinkled off and on for the rest of the day so weather wasn’t even an issue. Adams remained covered in a black cloud so we definitely made the right decision in skipping that but this cutover trail turned out to be a nightmare. It wasn’t even really a trail, it was more like bushwhacking and we were never sure if we were actually on the trail or just lost somewhere in the wilderness for most of it. For some reason though we kept going instead of turning around like we should have. After what turned out to be most of the day we finally made it back to the Osgood Trail (which is also the AT) and we headed down the steep descent back to the campsite where we arrived just after dark completely exhausted. 
We barely hiked 7 miles this day and yet we felt completely wiped. Instead of the 2 to 3 miles an hour we had hiked in PA up here we couldn’t even manage a single mile per hour. The White Mountains are no joke. We were properly humbled.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631900,"This year continues to be one where plans cannot be made and, if they are, they will be ruined. For this reason I am referring to this as the “Plandemic” of 2020. The plan for this month was to go to a reunion out in Yosemite Park to join our friends who were celebrating their 30 year wedding anniversary. The last time we were at Yosemite was 30 years ago for their wedding and we were not able to take much advantage of the great hiking out there on that last visit. This time we had secured the proper permits for hiking up Half Dome as well as for backcountry camping. We were excited to do some recon on The Muir Trail which happens to be number 2 behind the AT on our hiking bucket list (it’s a big list). Unfortunately these plans had to be scrapped last minute due to all the fires out west and the poor air quality in Yosemite.
So now we found ourselves with a couple of vacation days that we had already scheduled from work and what looked to be some pretty good weather over Columbus Day weekend. What to do? Well, hike the AT of course! Picking a section that we have not hiked yet that was within a few hours drive we decided upon tackling NJ from High Point SP to Longhouse Drive where we had left off a couple of years ago. There are not that many AT miles in NJ but still too many to fit into a long weekend outing so we will need to come back to finish the section from Delaware Water Gap where we left off in July to High Point SP where we hiked from on this trip.

Even though we had hiked for 3 weeks earlier in the summer and also had that quick trip to The Whites it was like we were starting all over again. It took us forever to pack, we took way too much stuff and we still managed to forget things. But we eventually got ourselves down to NJ and on the trail though we had to shorten up the first day and only hike a couple of miles due to our late arrival.

About 5 minutes into the hike we were freezing and made the decision to turn back to the car to grab extra layers. This did indeed keep us warm but added extra weight that we had to deal with for the next 3 days and the worst part was that we finally warmed up about an hour in and never really needed those extra layers for the rest of the trip.

Despite arriving late and carrying way too much stuff it was great to be back on trail.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631902,"This morning we were back to our usual routine and it was like we had never gotten off trail. It was great to be waking up in the forest again. Immediately we were impressed by the beauty of NJ, especially at this time of year with the leaves starting to turn colors plus it was the perfect weather for hiking.
The highlight of today was our side trip to the “Secret Shelter”. This is an unofficial shelter located on a nearby trail angel’s property. It was an incredibly scenic spot complete with a friendly donkey and an outlet to charge our phones. 
After our recent adventure in the Whites we found the terrain to be much easier here in NJ. We managed to cover over 12 miles in what felt more like a leisurely stroll than a hike.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631903,"Today was filled with many highlights, most notably the many miles of boardwalk through some really scenic wetlands. We also got to experience what could be considered a lowlight which was the most crowded section of trail we had ever hiked on going up “The Stairway to Heaven”. If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow don’t be alarmed now, be very, very annoyed. Hikers know the curse of an “earworm” when song lyrics get stuck in their head for hours and with a section of trail named Stairway to Heaven it is pretty much guaranteed to happen.
Most of our hiking highlights center around food and today was no different. The happiest moment of the day was when we took a break at the Heaven Hill Farm for some cider donuts and cold brew. This proved to be the perfect hiker snack which powered us through the rest of the day. It was extremely frustrating weaving in and out of all the tourists going up The Stairway To Heaven while strung out on donuts and caffeine. Get out of our way people!

Unfortunately, today also marked the end of our short vacation when we finally reached the car we had waiting for us at Longhouse Drive where we had started a previous northbound hike a couple of years prior. Another little section down, many more miles to come. We can’t wait until we step foot on Springer hopefully in March of 2021.
