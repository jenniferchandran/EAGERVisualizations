DragonLady,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603290,"Back again.Today, I needed up deep in my head about this journey. I have done endurance training before, that's doable. The mental and emotional part is what is waltzing around today. My original thru hike started because I had just gone thru a devastating loss and needed to recharge. It worked.Now, I am doing for a lot of different reasons. Being older, I've gone through some rough patches in life and also know how tough a long distance hike can become mentally. So I'm trying to really think about what mental things keep me going and enduring. You know, what will keep me going thru during the tough days? What do I do now? Work..get the endorphins going..so hike, keep one foot in front of the other. I also stop and breathe in the beauty around me..so be sure to take the moments to absorb the beauty and grandeur of the area. Be around people who share that love..duh, will be on the trail.Comfort items. Hot tea in am and hot cereal. So definitely a stove. Reading. Love nothing better than kicking back in my hammock, reading a book, pausing to enjoy our quiet hollow....so kindle or a larger screen phone. Wasn't going to bring one, though just InReach, but nope ,some way to bring my e-library along. May end up sending it back. But start with it. Tub bath..wow,, this will be my toughie. I can handle it , but may decide to throw in an actual motel stay with tub about once s month, lol! Anyhoo...ooo..Happy Trails!",,View Entry,"Sep 20, Thu",0
DragonLady,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603291,"So we did a plan to build both distance and weight endurance. We'll be doing local overnight hikes once a week, building distance graduslly, using our existing packs, then as we gather our gear, we'll narrow it down. Once we find what we will be carrying, then we'll get the best back suited to our needs that we can afford. We plan on hiking OUT this Fall and wintet, then probably head west for a few higher altitude trails over the summer. Thinking I may just end up using a hammock and undershirt system this time. Plan on testing it out this winter..we have a week or so of -0 weather in January, ususally. It'll come together. I home in our area daily, and am looking forward to expanding those goals!",,View Entry,"Sep 20, Thu",0

DragonLady,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603403,"Today started dedicated hikes to begin training for the AT. Took off up the hollow, about a ten mile hike..knew it was going to rain, so trying out a light weight poncho over me and the pack. It poured and then slowed to a drizzle.The beaches are starting to turn here and soon our woods will be golden! The Sassafras and Sumac are turning , and there are so many things in bloom...golden rod and aster, Joe Pye and Iron Weed...I love the fog rising off the creek. 
Boulders to climb over, twisted roots to admire...imagination created underworld cities...from Narnia...saw our resident bobcat, big boy! Poncho worked great...didn't have to battle jacket to get into pack...All in all a good day!",,View Entry,"Sep 21, Fri",0
