Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560126,"Friends, Family, Coworkers, Fellow Hikers, Casual Lurkers, Others:Five weeks from now, on Sunday, 21 May, I plan to stand at the trailhead of the Springer Mountain approach trail in Amicalola State Park and awkwardly ask someone standing nearby to take a photo of me since I think selfies make for really poor photography. Be sure to watch for that photo in a future post to this journal, pending an AT&T data signal can penetrate that deeply into the wilds of North Georgia.I am going to make this my official trek northward along the Appalachian Trail. I am not going to ""through-hike"" the trail all at once. I have other responsibilities that prevent me from going off-line for six consecutive unemployed months; but I will attempt to take a couple of weeks each year to make north-bound progress. To those hikers that accomplish a straight-through, non-stop, six month nature walk, I ask ""who mows your yard?""So with that as a very feeble and uninspired first entry into the journal, I continue my preparations and will report back here with updates as the time to make the trip draws nearer.",,View Entry,"Apr 16, Sun",0
Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560894,"One of the first rules of writing is to “consider your audience.” In the case of this journal, I'm not completely sure who that audience is. I am guessing that many of you who are reading this trail journal are here because I invited you to follow me along my trip. Some of you are family, some co-workers, some close friends and community acquaintances. And then some of you are probably just surfers who randomly found this site through a Google search of “classic tales of daring adventure.” Those of you who got here by searching “bear attacks” can just move on to the next search result link.
No matter how you arrived here, WELCOME.
Just so I can get an idea of who is out there, I'm going to request that your price of admission here is to sign the guest book on this trail journal site and let me know something about yourself. 
This journal will be a bit of an experiment. I plan to use it to serve multiple purposes:- A chronicle of my hike(s) along the Appalachian Trail,- An ability for my family to track my activities and location in something close to real time,- An opportunity for me to experiment with mobile phone technology and its ability to record and upload in-situ info from remote locations for others to see, and- A test of my patience in writing every word posted here with one finger typing on this tiny little mobile phone virtual keyboard.That last item may be the limiting factor of what gets written and posted. AT&T cell phone coverage, my ability to keep a charge on the phone using the GoalZero solar charger, and certain climate considerations may all affect what gets posted when, but I will at least make an attempt to keep my audience informed and happy. 31 days until I start the climb to Springer Mountain.",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Thu",0
Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563438,"I am now trying to plan and pack my meals for this trip.  This is one of the more difficult preparation steps.  Understandably, I want to conserve mass, yet eat well.  I do not want to pack too much food such that I carry the extra weight the entire trip, but I also do not want to skimp on supplies and run the risk of involuntarily becoming the AT’s version of the Donner Party.  My planned hike is around 130 miles.  If I bet myself that I can cover 10 miles a day, then I need meals for 13 days.  However, if I up the ante to 15 miles a day, then I would only need to pack 9 days worth of sustenance.  And, if I cover 130 miles a day, then you know that I simply drove a car to the end and am now at home eating pizza.  I’m going to hedge my bets and plan for 12 days.
After splaying my planned meals for 12 days across the floor of my dining room, I realized it will be difficult to get all of this into my pack and impossible to hike with it.  So I’m doing what every strategic thru-hiker does; I’m planning a food resupply drop.  I’ll start out with the first three days’ worth of food stuff, then pick up a nine day supply at Neel Gap (that I will leave at the Mountain Crossing store prior to starting the hike.  I’m smart like that!).  The 9 day supply will still be heavy, but by the time I get drop, I’ll have expended some stove fuel, toothpaste, and toilet paper.

For reference, I’ve included some photos of my 3 day food supply (see photo on this entry) and my 9 day food supply (see photo on next entry).  So I like oatmeal.  I may eat nothing but Little Debbie Star Crunch cookies for a day.  Don’t judge me.

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563440,"Apparently you can have only one photo per journal entry.  Here's the 9 day supply.  Oh - those numbers written in sharpie on all the food packages are calorie counts.  I'm trying to ensure I have a daily allowance of 2500.  I'm slightly over the ""rule of thumb"" to have 1.5 pounds of food per day.

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564609,"I'm now trimming my gear.  Like the food packing challenge, the goal is to bring enough gear to comfortably enjoy the hike yet minimize the mass you have to schlep up and down mountain trails. The photo on this post is a before/after look at the gear I am packing and how it fits into my Alps Mountaineering Cascade 5200. Without food, water, or fuel, this collection of gear weighs about 27 pounds.  I'd love to go lower, but I just cannot part with certain luxuries like a change of underwear, toilet paper, or toothpaste.
I will admit that I am bringing a totally unnecessary solar charging kit. At a weight of about 2 pounds, I have a Goal Zero solar panel, 4AA rechargeable batteries, a charging pack, various charging cables, a Galaxy S5 phone, and a USB charging block; in case I find an outlet somewhere in the wilderness.
Also note that I am not carrying a tent, but instead am going to try hammock camping.  On the AT, many hikers do not bring any shelter; they rely solely on the use of the more than 250 trail shelters found at regular intervals along the trail.    I've used these shelters in the past and have never slept well in them.  They all seem to have a local infestation of mice, rodents, skunks, and varmints that host nightly soirées as catered by the visiting backpacker and his precious food supply.  Its worth the extra 3 pounds of hammock mass to avoid that scene.

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565500,"It has begun!  I started the climb to Springer Mountain this afternoon.  I was already pretty tired from getting up at 4:30am to drive over to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. I left the truck (which starting having some serious idle trouble on the way over) at the NOC and got shuttled over to Amicalola State Park by “Catahoula,” where the AT approach trail to Springer begins under the iconic stone arch. 
3 sweaty uphill hours later, I pulled into the Black Gap shelter, where I am spending the night - in my hammock!","Amicalola State Park
",Black Gap Shelter,"May 21, Sun",7.40
Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566244,"I left the Black Gap shelter early this morning and hiked the remaining 1.7 miles to the summit of Springer Mountain, the official start of the Appalachian Trail. There is a long, storied debate about whether the AT should start at the peak of Springer Mountain, or should start 8.8 miles earlier at the arch in Amicalola. I'm going to consider those first 8.8 miles as a warm-up exercise.  After all, once you have packed away several hundred miles, what difference do those first few miles make?
At the summit of Springer Mountain, there is a large rock outcropping on which a stately marker is mounted that indicates the beginning of the AT.  After I took a few photos of the marker, I headed north. Simultaneously, it started to rain. And rain. And rain. I walked until I was exhausted, which happened to place me at the Gooch Mountain shelter, 15.8 miles past Springer.  Remember, I already hiked 1.7 miles uphill just to get to the AT marker.  The rain has stopped just long enough to set up camp, cook dinner, and talk with the other hikers staying at Gooch Mountain Shelter that night.","Black Gap Shelter

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566334,"Last night, I awoke around midnight to the loud staccato noise of raindrops on canvas.  It rained all night. Lots of loud, wet, cold rain. All night.  It was 30 minutes after I awoke this morning before I could convince myself that I cannot avoid the torture of dressing in the same damp cold clothes I wore yesterday (that's right - I don't change underwear every day on the trail. I cannot afford the mass or pack space.)
But even worse was the experience of putting on the wet socks and boots that filled with water from yesterday's hike.  My feet already had blisters on the heels and wet socks did not help. 

The hike today was through a misty, cloudy forest. I passed plenty of rocky outcrops that surely looked out upon beautiful scenery, but today it was curtained by a sheet of bright grey mist. I was definately flying in IMC (look it up).

The hike through Woody Gap and on to Slaughter Creek campsites was a long wet 12.8 mile slog. I had intended to just camp there. But I knew that just on the other side of the 4410 foot high Blood Mountain was a dry, warm, hikers hostel. So, over Blood Mountain I go.  After a 15.6 mile day, I very slowly eased myself into an upper bunk at the Walasi-Yi hostel.  Without details, let's just say the upper bunk is a real challenge to a sore, exhausted body.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565916,"I'm starting to realize that having signal in the backcountry, having a phone with charge, and having enough energy at the end of a long day of hiking to write something must all align to get a post submitted. 
I may have to write some of my entries retroactively (is that even allowed under the rules of journaling?)
It finally stopped raining today and is turning cooler. That will make the long uphill slogs more tolerable. I'll admit, I packed too much and having picked up my 9 day food supply at Neels Gap, I'm now paying for it. I envy all the other hikers with their ultralight 20 pound load. The bears may get some of their own ""trail magic"" along the side of the footpath if I get tired enough.  Each night, my choice of what to have for dinner basically comes down to ""which one of these meals weighs the most?""","Neel Gap

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566340,"Today started with [you guessed it] more rain.  It only lasted long enough to dampen everything, but that's the point - everything is damp or wet.  I have been successful in keeping my clean clothes dry, my sleeping bag dry, and my food dry.  But everything else is anywhere from moist to saturated.  I'm guessing that adds about 2 pounds to my pack weight.My initial destination today was to get to Unicoi Gap.  GA Hwy 75 runs through Unicoi Gap about 10 miles north of Helen, GA.  So after another day of foggy conditions, I arrived at Unicoi Gap only to realize that this was a true gap; it's a steep incline on each side with a busy highway running through the middle of it.  There was really no where to camp - and besides, it is very good advice when backpacking to never camp near a busy road.  Because it was only around 4pm, I decided to make the climb from Unicoi Gap (2949 feet in elevation) up Rocky Mountain (4017 feet in elevation), and back down into Indian Grave Gap (3113 feet in elevation) about 2.4 miles away.  As I climbed, I was experiencing complete exhaustion.  My steps became a shuffle of less than a boot length.  My feet were hurting worse than ever.  I just kept reminding myself that the day's end was near.The descent down the other side of Rocky Mountain was not as difficult as the climb, but was also not as easy as it should have been.  Two hours later, I finally got to Indian Grave Gap, removed my pack, sat down and gently began to pull off my boots and wet socks.  Recall that I have had some heel blister problems for the entire trip.  After four days of aggressive hiking, wet socks, an overloaded pack, and unkind boots, my heels have progressed from blisters to open festering wounds.  While that is bad, the worse part is that my ankles are swelling.  I called my wife and talked to her.  She referred my to my oldest daughter, who gave me the benefit of her freshly minted Nursing Degree to let me know that I have an infection and potential cellulitis.  I need to get off the trail.  That will be tomorrow's job.To find the ""silver lining"" here, I actually did have a descent weather day and took my one and only scenic photo from the summit of Rocky Mountain looking toward Yonah Mountain (the tall one in the photo).","Low Gap Shelter
",Indian Grave Gap,"May 25, Thu",12.40
Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566342,"I awoke this morning to find my ankles even more swollen.  It was extremely painful to stand up from my hammock.  I made several involuntary vocal exclamations.  The decision was made; I had to leave the trail right there and then.  Indian Grave Gap has a gravel forest service road running through it that is publicly accessible.  I knew that if I decided to hike any further (as if I COULD hike any further), it was around 16 miles until the next extraction point.
I fortunately have some dear family friends that live near Helen, GA.  A few phone calls later, they were on the way to pull me off the trail.  This afternoon, I visited a local clinic and was definitively diagnosed with an infection and cellulitis.  I now have a generous supply of gauzes, bandages, and Cephalexin.
I am extremely disappointed.  Even a little depressed.  I so much wanted to get a full 136 miles of AT hiking done, but the enduring wet weather combined with some blistering problems did me in.  I suppose I should focus on the 55.3 miles of the AT that I did get to hike.  That's more than 1/40 of the entire trail!  
But this is not the end!  I am sure that I will find some better fitting boots, purchase some lighter gear, and find a way to take another week off from work to complete that initial section of the trail up through the Nantahala Outdoor Center and, hopefully, on to Fontana Dam.  Let's just look at this as if I am taking several ""zero-mile"" rest days.

Today is my 36th “zero mile” day since the Unfortunate Blister Incident at Indian Grave Gap.  An historic marker is being installed. 
Considering my holiday weekend outlook...
my family is out of town for a few days,the 4th of July is on a Tuesday (meaning few people will be at work on Monday), andI solved my truck's idle issue by replacing the fuel pump,
...this seems like the perfect time to sneak out and get in another 30 miles on the AT!
This afternoon, I left work a few hours early (sorry, boss!) and made the drive over to North Carolina in my now highly reliable supertruck.  My destination is Deep Gap on the AT.  A few miles east of Murphy, NC, gravel Forest Service road 71 twists, turns, spins and climbs it's way through mountain valleys and around ridges until it ends at the appropriately named Deep Gap. I knew rain was in the forecast (rain... always rain), so I set up a huge plastic tarp near my truck, under which I pitched my tent.  Tomorrow I get shuttled back around  to Indian Grave Gap.  I'll begin my hike from where I was extracted last time.  I am mentally preparing myself for traumatic flashbacks. Stay strong.",,View Entry,"Jun 30, Fri",0
Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571335,"My prearranged shuttle transport arrived in Deep Gap promptly at 0900 and drove me around to Indian Grave Gap. [Here's a free endorsement for Ron Brown if you need shuttle services around the GA/NC area.]  He dropped me off at around 1000 and I started the hike. The overnight rain had cleared out and the day turned sunny, warm and humid.  Leaving Indian Grave Gap, I made the climb up Tray Mountain.  My new (but worn enough to be pretty well “broken in”) boots felt like walking barefoot through marshmallows which made me think about s’mores which made me hungry which had me stopping for lunch at Tray Mountain shelter.  AT shelters are mostly built near reliable springs and water sources, so they serve as a good place to replenish your water and hydrate.
The rest of the afternoon was spent struggling up steep inclines and tromping down whatever the opposite of inclines are (declines?  No, thank you).  I arrived at Deep Gap shelter (no relation to Deep Gap from yesterday) about ten minutes before the rain arrived.  One hiker was already there.  I decided I would sleep in the shelter rather than try to set up my hammock in the rain.  After about thirty minutes, three more soggy hikers arrived. The shelter has a loft, so we are lodging two upstairs and three down.  I am avoiding the loft since I do not want to have the additional challenge of navigating a ladder at 3:00am, should I decide to take a break from sleeping.  Tomorrow I finish the Georgia portion of the trail.","Indian Grave Gap

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571336,"During a tour of Monticello, I remember the guide saying that Thomas Jefferson would arise in the morning once it was bright enough to see the time on the clock located across the room.  Not being a morning person, I have no idea what that means.  However, when hiking, I do try to get up and get out as early as possible - if only to get most of my hiking done in cooler morning air rather than the afternoon humidity-saturated sauna.  Deep Gap shelter was surprisingly mouse-free last night.  I was up, packed, and hiking north by 7am EDT.  3.5 miles later, I stopped at Dicks Creek Gap, where the AT crosses highway 76, to cook breakfast and coffee on one of the concrete picnic tables there.  I then proceeded to make my way to the Georgia/North Carolina border at Bly Gap. Not far past breakfast, in the middle of the trail, I found a huge pile of what could be nothing other than bear “scat.”  Understand, I'm no bear expert, but I can think of nothing else in the woods big enough to make that much of a dump.  Definitely not a dog.  Mastodons are extinct.  I studied it for a bit, and seeing no human finger bones, teeth or skull pieces, I decided to move on. I later regretted not taking a photo.
Around mid-afternoon, I arrived at the GA/NC border and soon thereafter, during my 13th mile of the day, i struggled to climb the steepest ascent I've had to conquer thus far on the trail. There should be a sign at the state line that says “Mountains?  You want mountains?  Yeah, yeah - I know, I know - you already climbed “mountains” in Georgia.  Here’s the deal...those were nothing.  Seriously nothing.  Just rolling swells.  Piedmont.  Molehills.  North Carolina, however, is bringin’ the MOUNTAINS.  Just lookin’ at that word with all those ups and downs should makes your eyes tired:
/^^/MOUNTAINS\/\^.
Tighten your laces, boys; here we go!”
I survived that first dose of NC mountains just past the state line (barely) and arrived at Muskcat Creek shelter around 5.  I know NC is not kidding around about the mountains since the tallest peak on the entire Appalachian Trail, Clingman's Dome, rises to 6643 feet and sits on the border between Tennessee and NC in the middle of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  The highest peak in Georgia was Blood Mountain at 4458'.  Molehills.
I set up my hammock, known on the AT as a “bear burrito” and said hi to the multiple other hikers staying at the shelter that night.  I had just enough time to eat dinner and crawl into my burrito before the inevitable, inescapable, indefatigable rain showers set in once again for the next several hours.","Deep Gap Shelter

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571339,"I learned several things last night as I listened to the rain rolling over my hammock tarp.  The first thing was that the rain was also rolling under my hammock tarp.  It took me a while to figure out how the underside of my tarp was getting wet, but apparently the seam along the crest of the tarp had lost its waterproof seal, allowing dribbles and drips to find their way down the soggy tarp and into my increasingly damp sleeping area.  Fortunately, the rain slacked off around dark and left me with only the occasional drip that found its way into my bed.  The second thing I learned was that I had unwittingly invited around 20 chiggers to join me in my hammock to feast on my knees, shins and ankles.  While not nearly as debilitating as the Great Blister Incident, it was increasingly uncomfortable last night as I tried to find a position in the hammock from which I could scratch all 20 itchy chigger sites (say that 10 times fast; ""itchy chigger"").
Early this morning, I once again followed Mr. Jefferson’s advice and began preparing to hike as soon as it was light enough to see my surroundings.  I was packed and walking away from the shelter by 7.  Being first out on the trail in the early morning has its definite charms - the solitude, the quiet whisperings of your surroundings, the gentle cloud-like mist drifting through the canopy.  It also has its definite curses - the hundreds of spider webs strung across the trail during the previous evening that end up stretched across your nose or eyes and streaming ribbon-like behind you.  Being first down the trail means you get to be the web buster for everyone else to follow.  I cannot imagine what would cause a spider to think that spanning a web across the trail is a good idea.
SPIDER 1:  Betcha can’t catch one of those big biped walky things.
SPIDER 2:  Hold my spider beer.
SPIDER 1:  We’ll eat like KINGS!
I spent about two and a half uneventful hours hiking back to supertruck at Deep Gap.  Once in the truck, I retraced my route down forest service road 71 back out to highway 64 and went straight to the McDonalds in Hayesville, NC to get some breakfast and coffee.
This hike was a relatively short trip totalling almost 30 miles.  I'm glad that I spent the weekend preceding the 4th of July hiking this trail; the Appalachian Trail itself is a true American treasure.  My next trip out will likely be in the fall where I will start at Deep Gap and attempt to go all the way to Fontana Dam, covering a distance of around 80 more miles.  Until then...

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579661,"As of yesterday, I successfully completed 101 sequential days of ""zero miles"" on the Appalachian Trail!  I ended that streak today.
I had packed my gear the night before and loaded it into the Highlander so that, at 0600, I was able to stagger out to the car and begin driving east toward the Nantahala Outdoor Center.  Heavy fog blanketed my route from North Alabama to Chattanooga.  Traffic backed up at the junction of I24 and I59 due to a freight truck that had rolled over and spilled its load, blocking all east-bound lanes and causing traffic to be routed south on I59.  I had to drive a quarter of the way to Birmingham before I could turn around and get back on course.  I arrived at the NOC around 1245 (EDT) and immediately found my transport driver, already waiting to chauffeur me around to where I left the trail 102 days ago at Deep Gap [and again, I highly recommend Ron Brown as a reliable and entertaining shuttle driver for hikers seeking transport in the NC/GA area].  I shared the ride with two other hikers from Albany, Georgia who were being dropped off at Rock Gap near Standing Indian Campground.
After the twisting drive down Forest Road 71, Ron dropped me off at Deep Gap.  I put on my pack, adjusted my straps and started uphill toward Standing Indian Mountain, elevation 5499 (the highest point along the trail south of the Smokeys).  After only about 100 yards, I found a bag of ""trial magic"" suspended on a low tree branch.  Three cold Colas, a bag of powdered donuts and a couple of single serving Cheetos bags were tucked away for whatever hungry hiker wanted to partake.  I decided to enjoy a cola right there on the spot.  I guzzled it down and stowed the empty can back in the bag so I could avoid packing it around for the next four days.  I also stashed a small bag of Cheetos in my cargo shorts because, hey - cargo shorts!
The rest of the day was spent sprinting up and over Standing Indian Mountain and on to Carter Gap Shelter.  To the best of my memory, I have climbed Standing Indian Mountain five times now (chronologically: once in Boy Scouts, once after college with friends on a prior segment hike, once during a spontaneously suggested and poorly planned afternoon hike with my wife, brother and father during a weekend family camping trip where everyone was extremely hangry and grouchy because we neglected to bring any snacks on that now infamous 8.4 mile loop hike from Standing Indian Campground and I KNOW I saw my brother drop back behind us and eat a full-sized Hershey bar without offering to share it but he still denies to this day, once on a loop hike with a few adult scout leaders, and once today) and I have never seen anything but clouds up there.
I arrived at Carter Gap Shelter just before sunset.  I had hiked 8.5 miles since Deep Gap starting at 2:45 in the afternoon.  Pretty good pace!  There are 9 other hikers here going both directions.  I got here late enough that I did not socialize much, but simply set up the hammock, ate dinner, and laid down for the night.","Deep Gap

Before long, I found myself making the hand-over-hand climb up one of the steepest sections on this part of the AT - the ascent up Albert Mountain.  This is actually one of my favorite locations on the trail as I have hiked it multiple times and always enjoy coming to the repeated conclusion of ""Wow - I'm glad that's over.""  This time was no different.  At the summit of Albert is an old firetower, which, of course, must also be climbed.  The view from Albert Mountain was much like what I saw at breakfast - an ocean of clouds.
The rest of the day was spent working my way northward.  I eventually crossed Highway 64 at Winding Stair Gap.  Looking at the map, i knew i would not make it to the next shelter, so I chose a campsite at Moore Creek to start setting up the hammock and begin making dinner.  A lone female hiker heading south also stopped at the campground for the night.  I do not recall her trail name, but I think she said her civilian name was Barb.  She was doing a ""flip flop"" hike through hike and was heading for Springer Mountain to finish the trail.  I am impressed. The trail guide shows I hiked over 16 miles today.  I am again impressed.","Carter Gap Shelter

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579673,"Moore Creek Gap, where I camped last night, must be an owl sanctuary.  All night from all directions, multiple owls hooted their calls across the gap.  One would hoot, another would echo, and yet another would relay the song across the forest and into the distance.  The evening before, I heard coyotes yelping and barking.  I was thankful that they sounded to be some distance from the camp.  Why is it that hearing owls around your camp is warm and comforting and hearing howling coyotes is scary and threatening? I guess its because one appears to be benevolent and wise while the other appears to be viscous and rabid.  Owls eat mice; coyotes eat carrion.  Owls hunt alone; coyotes hunt in packs.  Owls wear graduation caps and glasses; coyotes paint fake highway tunnels on rock walls in hopes of catching road runners.
You would think that hiking alone would provide ample time to mentally solve all of life's problems, to praise your Maker for the astounding beauty that surrounds you, to contemplate your place in the universe.  But instead, you mostly just think about eating trail mix and how far you may have hiked since you last checked your watch 4 minutes ago.  That and trying to remember the lyrics to old Steve Miller Band songs.
Today's dose of miles took me up and over Wayah Bald.  As I emerged from the forest onto a paved walkway, I was surprised to see families with children, teenagers with cell phones, strollers with babies, dogs with leashes, owls with coyotes (you get the idea).  The shock of sudden civilization was harsh.  It was there that I learned from an Auburn student that they had blown a 20 point lead to lose to LSU the day before.  The shock of civilization was VERY harsh.
I targeted Cold Spring Shelter as my stopping point for the evening.  I'm going to try sleeping in the shelter tonight, regardless of mice.  I'm tired and ready to sleep on a flat solid surface rather than using the hammock for another night.  Besides, its forecast to rain all night and I prefer to be under a roof than a tarp for that.  I am really trying to push the miles today and tomorrow so that I can get to the car and be off the trail by tomorrow night.  The rain will be followed by a cold front with the forecast temperatures dropping to nearly freezing.  I arrived at the shelter to find two other hikers there already.  They were kind enough to allow me a 4x7 foot space all to myself for the evening.","Moore Creek Gap
",Cold Spring Shelter,"Oct 15, Sun",15
Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579672,"I did not get up and out of the shelter as soon as I would have liked this morning.  It rained all night and to sleep on a flat surface in a warm down bag under a solid roof was actually very comfortable.  Here's an Appalachian Trail secret: rain seems to keep the shelter mice away.  Also works for shelter moose.
I slowly rolled over and retrieved my stove, made oatmeal and coffee, and eventually packed up to hike the final distance to the car at the Nantahala Outdoor Center.  It was 12 miles away, but 8 of those miles were steeply downhill.
Since this would likely be my last day hiking for a while, I boldly broke one of the most sacred rules of the outdoors - I used electronics to play music...out loud! ...with no earphones!  I know, this is considered to be backcountry sacrilege among the purists, but I was hiking alone and the only others who heard my sonic pollution were south-bounders.  They had to endure it for the few seconds required to pass me going the other way, but I still felt their looks of contempt on my twerking backside.  As for my choice of music, I downloaded several albums to my phone: ZZ Top, The Eagles, Pink Floyd, and (don't laugh) the Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Soundtrack Vol. I and II.  I especially like ""Mr. Blue Sky"" by ELO, ""Brandy"" by Looking Glass, and ""Surrender"" by Cheap Trick.  I'll admit, it is a little awkward to pass someone while playing Parliament's ""Flash Light.""
Also, while it is an excellent album, Bela Fleck & Abigail Washburn's ""If I had a Shotgun"" and ""Railroad"" has just one too many banjos for the backwoods.  It felt like hiking through the setting for Deliverance - which, by the way, was filmed nearby near the Georgia/South Carolina border.
The primary landmark for the day was Wesser Bald.  This isolated mountain top has a nice observation tower at its peak.  But, as I have come to expect, the view was haze and clouds.  The midday sun was quickly burning off the fog, but I wanted to get to the car and get home, so I did not stick around.
Past Wesser Bald, the trail follows a series of thin, high ridge segments.  At some locations, the trail is only a few feet wide with the terrain dropping down hundreds of feet on both sides.  Its almost like walking across a narrow skybridge of earth between anchoring mountains.  At one point, the trail seems to simply end at a cliff's edge.  This is called the ""jump-off"" (or ""jump-on"" depending on your direction).  The path actually continues just past the jump-off cliff down a very steep set of steps and into the thicker forest.
I arrived at the NOC around 2:30 this afternoon.  I changed out of my hiking clothes in to jeans and a t-shirt, looked around a bit, and noted where the AT crosses the train tracks and continues uphill.  To balance the descent of almost 3000 feet from Wesser to NOC, the trail leaves NOC with an immediate ascent of 3200 feet to the summit of Cheoah Bald.  But, fortunately, that is a challenge for another day and another year.  The drive back home included a hamburger, fries and cola - traditional post-hike cuisine.
I am just a little disappointed that did not complete my goal of reaching Fontana Dam by the end of 2017.  But I did get to the NOC by covering a total of 144 miles within three segment hikes and six months.  Add to that all the rain, humidity, the Great Blister Incident, the multiple drives over to the Nantahala region, the transportation logistics, working a full-time job, and appeasing an understanding wife and family, I think hiking from Amicalola State Park to the NOC in one hiking season is a pretty admirable accomplishment.  I have now completed about 1/15 of the entire trail.  At this rate, I should reach Katahdin in the year 2032.  For next year, I am considering the Nolichucky River in Erwin, TN at mile 342 as my goal for 2018.  Tune in next year to see how I'm doing!","Cold Spring Shelter

Today is Saturday, 14 April and it is raining.  Not rain as from a passing cloudburst, but that steady constant drippy drizzle that would make hiking the trail today an exercise in personal fortitude.  I am warm and dry, sitting at my kitchen table looking out of the window and thinking about all the AT hikers who had likely planned to start their thru-hike on 01 April and now, two weeks later, are either already off the trail or seriously considering it given this spring's dose of cold, wet, stormy weather.
I have been browsing though multiple journals on www.trailjournals.com.  So many of them seem to start off with great enthusiasm and optimism.  They start with happy stories of how they imagine the hike will progress, how they may be able to ""lose a few pounds along the way,"" how they just retired from their job, how understanding their spouse is to let them do this, how they have been wanting to hike the AT for their entire life and now is the time.  The introductions often include details on how they have been planning for months ahead of time, packing and mailing multiple supply drop-boxes, spending hundreds on new gear and clothes.  Unfortunately, many if not most of the journals seem to end after two or three days into the hike.  Some end with an all-too-common of a story that includes weather hardship, gear failures, repetitive motion injuries, endurance issues, homesickness, or some total mismatch of their expectations versus the reality of the trail.  These are a little sad to read because you know these people started out with honest intentions.  But they just had something that prevented them from fulfilling the plan.
It is the other journals that are a bit disturbing - the ones that just stop with no explanation.  They often end with a last statement that reads something like ""tomorrow I hope to make it to Podunky Shelter"" then ... nothing.  I always wonder what happened to these hikers and why they decided to call it quits.  At least give us an epilogue that says ""my pizza dependency prevented me from going any further"" or ""it was at that moment that I decided I would be better off living a feral life with the bears"" or even ""Dammit!  Hiking's hard!  I'm out!""
As for me, I am looking over my calendar for May to decide what weekend may be best to finally complete my goal from last year and arrive at Fontana Dam.  I want to get there before 21 May, since that will be one year since I started my hike in 2017.","

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590615,Back on the trail today but too tired to mess with writing.  It’s nearly midnight and I need to get some sleep.  Read tomorrow’s entry where I will cover today’s fun.,"Nantahala Outdoor Center
",Sassafras Gap Shelter,"May 11, Fri",6.70
Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590616,"As of 6:30pm this evening, I completed a 29 mile hike in just over 24 hours.  I started to regret that decision around mile 25.  But before I whine about how tired I am, allow me to diverge into an unnecessary recap of the adventure thus far…
If you read my prior journal entries, then you will know that last year, on May 21, I set out to do an epic hike from Amicalola Falls State Park, up to Springer Mountain, and then on to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) and maybe – if all went well - on to Fontana Dam, a total distance of about 175 miles.  While I did not complete this distance in one trip, I was able to string several weekend hikes together in 2017 to get myself to the NOC.
Now, it is mid-May of 2018 and I am ready to get on with my planned hikes for this year.  I have always wanted to hike completely through the GREAT Smokey Mountain National Park in one trip.  Yes, because they are GREAT!  Because I left the trail in 2017 at the NOC and the Smokeys start at Fontana Dam, I still needed to cover the 29 miles between the two.  Thus this weekend’s trip.
I had an unavoidable obligation at work yesterday until around lunch, so I did not start driving until after noon.  Four-point-five hours later, I was parking at Fontana Dam where I met my shuttle transport for a quick hop over to the NOC.  I stepped out of the shuttle and onto the Nantahala River footbridge at exactly 6:30pm EDT.  And up I go.  The hike out of NOC is pretty brutal.  NOC is at 1732 feet above mean sea level and Swim Bald is almost six miles away at 4710 feet.  All uphill.  I knew it would be dark soon, but I consoled myself with the thought that, if needed, I could always just pop the tent up anywhere along the trial and continue hiking in the morning.  The problem was, there aren't any decently flat tent spots along this mountainside.  I started to wish I had brought my hammock.
As the sun set, I continued to update my estimation of time required to reach the Sassafras Gap Shelter, located about a mile past Swim Bald.  I also reminded myself of certain rules I try to follow: never hike alone; never sleep in a rodent-infested shelter; never hike after dark; never mention that Scottish play in a theater.  Eventually, I pulled out my headlamp and plodded onward.
I reached the shelter unharmed at around 9:30pm.  To my great surprise, I was the only person there.  It was admittedly a little creepy to be in the shelter alone – especially knowing that this was high hiking season with so many others on the trail.  I heated some water, made some noodles, unrolled the bed, and crawled in.  I did not care about the mice at that point.  About 3 minutes after the light was out, I suddenly DID care about the mice as they could be heard scampering around everywhere.  Maybe they would just keep to the edges of the platform and not drop into the facehole of my sleeping bag where they would then dart around all over me inside the bag trying to get out while giving me rabies or the plague or mouse cooties or something.  Nightmare fuel.
The next morning, I was up before the sun, packed everything away, and was hiking before 7.  I topped Cheoah Bald just as the sun was starting to peek over the other mountain tops.  There I met a nice couple who had tented on the open bald.  We talked for a few minutes and he took the photo of me featured on today’s entry.
The rest of the day was uneventful until I reached Cable Gap Shelter.  I had initially planned on stopping here for the night and hiking back to the car at Fontana tomorrow morning.  But it was only 2:30 in the afternoon and I had nearly 6 hours of daylight left.  Tomorrow is Mother’s Day and I convinced myself that it would be a nice surprise for my wife to have me return home tonight and be available all day tomorrow for family stuff.  What I did not consider was that I had already hiked more than 15 mountain miles.  But the last 4 back to the car were downhill, so again, off I went.  HUGE MISTAKE.
Two miles later, I was sore, tired, drained of energy and wishing I had stopped for the day.  The downhill descent to Fontana Dam goes on FOREVER.  Switchback after switchback takes you lower and lower, but seemingly never any closer to the dam.  Then, just when you think you have finally arrived, you learn that you are only at the marina and still need to hike an additional 1.5 miles to reach the Fontana Dam shelter.
OK – so a brief word about the Fontana Dam shelter.  Its nice.  Really nice.  The mice wear ties.  Its nicknamed the “Fontana Hilton” because it has ample bunk space, a nice deck, a shower and flush toilet bathroom nearby, and a great lakefront view.  At that point, though, I could not care less.  By that time, I was in zombie stagger mode and only wanted to get to the car and drive home.
The parking lot for the Dam Visitors’ Center is another half mile down a nicely manicured sidewalk complete with contoured stone kneewall.  I hobbled to the car, took a quick rinsing shower at the Dam’s Visitor Center (yes, there is another shower there too) and drove home.
That was a very difficult hike, but only because I plowed through 29 miles in such a short time.  But I did succeed in arriving at Fontana Dam on 12 May, allowing me to claim my goal of completing the AT from the beginning of the trail to the beginning of the Smokeys in less than a year.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Once again I have been granted some time away from home and work to continue my NOBO (that's trail-speak for ""north bound"") trek on the AT.  On this trip, I will be attempting to hike the 71 miles of AT through the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  I am currently writing this entry as I lay in my new REI Quarter Dome tent located just up the hill from the Fontana Dam shelter where I left the trail last May.  And its HOT.  Not the tent, (although it do look pretty *fine*) but the weather.  Its now October and still hitting 90 everyday.  Blegh.  Because its a nice clear night, I have the rain fly pulled aside to provide at least a little air circulation.  And the night sky is beautiful.  An infinite canvas of uncountable stars stretches across the sky just above the canopy of oak trees surrounding my hot little tent.  I hope tomorrow is cooler than today.  If not, that initial 2800' climb out of Fontana into the park will be like swimming uphill in a sauna.
The drive from my home to GSMNP today was easy and unremarkable.  I parked at the Big Creek Ranger Station where I met my transport driver, Beverly.  She had been shuttling hikers all day and admitted to me that she was tired.  Tired enough to ask me to drive!  I gladly complied.  We had a very nice visit on the way to Fontana, discussing everything from politics to weather, from auto repair to family.  Beverly: if you are reading this, know that you and your family have my prayers.
I sleep now.  Must rest up for the sauna swim into the Smokies.  Yes, the plural of Smoky is Smokies.  See photo.  More tomorrow.","

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604355,"Today began with an early morning walk across Fontana Dam.  I tried to fully appreciate the unremarkable paved flatness of the dam, knowing that would be the last level surface I would see for days.  Once across, the trail began its uphill slant and, soon enough, climbed steeply toward Shuckstack Tower.  Around two miles into the hike, I saw a mid-sized bear cross the trail about 30 yards ahead of me.  I thought about trying to take a photo, but was sure the bear wouldn't appreciate a selfie, so instead I loudly shouted ""good morning!"" and sent the bear on a dash through the woods.  Many of the shelters and campsites on the south end of the park have bear warnings issued.  Campsite 113 is closed due to bear activity.  Bear ""scat"" is abundant on the trail.  Jazz scat is lacking.
Several hours and 3 sweat-liters later, I reached the Shuckstack firetower and made the requisite climb to the top.  The views were fully worth the climb.
The National Park Service requires all backcountry hikers to use an online system to register and reserve spots at the various shelters along the AT.  Its their way of managing numbers and preserving low-impact natural environments.  The problem with this system is that you have to fully plan your entire hike, along with where you are going to spend each night, up to a month in advance.  I initially predicted a very conservative six day hike with stops at shelters spaced about 12-15 miles apart.  My first day was an all-uphill 11 mile climb to Mollies Ridge shelter.
I arrived at Mollies Ridge shelter at about 2:30 in the afternoon - far too early to quit for the day.  I had a decision to make: be compliant to my plan; be a conformist; follow the rules; keep to my registration and hiking schedule that I filed with the Park Service by staying at Mollies Ridge ... OR ... be a rebel and hike to the next shelter.
I continued hiking.
So now I am at Russell Field Shelter as a fugitive from justice.  I am on the lam from the Park Service.  Backpacking anarchy!!!
Also here are two married couples and two other guys.  The married couples are from Cincinnati and are somewhat locally famous as twin brothers who married sisters.  I think the two other guys are also brothers.

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604360,"I was able to get an early start out of Russell Field this morning.  Early is relative since it is now October and it doesn't get bright enough to put away your headlamp until about 7:30am or so.  I was hiking by about 8:15am.  And again, the day was warm with many uphill climbs.  Have I written about my mutant-like ability to sweat?  I'm pretty sure there's not a place on the Avengers or X-Men for a guy who can pump puddles of liquid through his skin, but I am that guy.  Any slight uphill grade that I find myself approaching causes the waterworks to activate.  I would almost rather it be raining.  With rain, I get just as wet, but rain comes at you from the outside-in.  Sweat soaks you from the inside-out.  By the time I reached Silers Bald Shelter, I look as if I just stepped out of the pool fully clothed.  While today was sunny, my pack and clothes are dripping with liquid that I probably drank sometime that morning.
My disregard for my registered hiking plan continues.  By staying at Silers Bald Shelter, I am now 5.7 miles ahead of schedule.  I may be able to cut a full day off my hike if I keep this up - so long as I can avoid the Ridge Runner Rangers.  I wonder what the fine is for being an aggressive hiker.
Today was lots of climbs.  I'm still bothered that I brought so much food.  The pack is overweight, but I do like food.
Tonight is at Silers Bald shelter with a bunch of mookie late-20 year olds from South Florida.  I overhead one of them ask another ""did you really fill a two liter soda bottle with bourban?"" to which the response was ""yeah, but I've marked the level of each day's amount with a sharpie to ensure we don't run out.""  I think one of them has an iron skillet.  
I am tolerating these guys for the night.  Fortunately, they are all too tired to get too drunk and rowdy.  Just drunk enough to fall asleep.","Russell Field Shelter

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604361,"Last night at Siler's Bald Shelter, I had a lower bunk and tried to get to bed early.  One of the mooks decided to light a fire in the small fireplace, but negleted to  check if the chimney would draw away the smoke.  It didn't.  I had to tolerate a smoky bedroom for about an hour until the wood quit smoldering.  I eventually slept - and coughed.
The next morning, I packed up and got away before most of the mooks awoke.  I hiked the 1.7 miles to the next shelter, which - if I had thought about it the prior evening - would have been my preferred shelter.  Anyway, I made a hot instant oatmeal and coffee breakfast at the Double Springs Shelter.  I met and talked with a southbound thru hiker.  His pack was about half the size of mine.  He told me that he uses a down quilt for bedding rather than a sleeping bag and basically just does without lots of stuff that most other hikers carry.  I personally like my sleeping bag.  And my rain gear.  And my water filter.  And underwear.  
I am trying to find a good balance between being an outlaw hiker who has abandoned his registration schedule and my habit of hiking myself to exhaustion everyday.  I love a challenge, but need to more carefully choose the challenges I pursue.
I summitted Clingmans Dome around lunch today.  One minute, I was surrounded by the solitude of the backcountry; the next minute, I was swept up in the seething masses of humanity attempting to struggle up the paved walkway to the curved ramp that leads to the top of the tower that caps Clingman's Dome.  It was overcast, foggy, and windy, not an ideal day for great mountain views.  I went to the top just to say I did it, looked around, and immediately descended to continue my hike.  It was kinda nice to be noticed by the tourists.  ""Are you hiking the Appalachian Trail?  How long have you been living in the woods?  Do you forage for food like a squirrel?""  
Newfound Gap is where the primary road through the park crosses the main mountain ridge from the north side to the south side.  There is a huge parking lot that was full of people and families milling around.  I decided to use the trash here to lose about 5 pounds of food.  I hated to throw it away, but I hated even more the thought of dragging it up and down the next 30 miles of mountain trails uneaten.
Between Newfound Gap and the Icewater Shelter, I passed up to 100 people on the trail, all returning from a hike up to the famed Charles Bunion formation area.  I finally reached the shelter around 4:30pm to find several others already there.  Because it's only a few meters off the trail, for the next hour, we had Bunion hikers wandering through the shelter like tourists gawking at a civil war re-enactment camp.  ""Wow.  So thus is what it is like to be a backpacker.  Are you all really going to sleep up here?""
For dinner, I finally broke out the worst flavor of the Mountain Home dehydrated dinner line.  Lazagna.  It uses some kind of dried cheese that, when rehydrated, sticks to everything and is difficult to clean off your spork.  And it's not very tasty either.  2 of 5 stars.
Tonight's contingent of hikers invludes two sisters from Wisconsin, a guy from Birmingham, another from Western Kentucky, and two guys from Tampa.  Good group.  Well behaved, no smoking.  Responsible with the fire in the fireplace.  No bourban.  Well, at least not two liters worth.","Silers Bald Shelter

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604362,"Today was possibly one of the most perfect hiking days I have ever experienced.  The pack was light (after dumping several pounds of food yesterday), the weather was cool and clear, the humidity was low, climbs were minimal and gradual, and the views were just amazing.  The only way today could have been better was if I had gotten a better night's sleep last night.  The shelter-mates were great: fun to visit with, good stories, enjoyable fellowship - until the lights went off and the snoring began.  One guy in particular sawed enough logs to build several more shelters.  And the grind wasn't intermittent or for just a few hours - it was all night without end.
PRO-LIFE-HIKING TIP:  Those expanding foam earplugs are LITERALLY worth their weight in gold in a trail shelter.  I used a pair to block the noise, and yet still had a little trouble getting through the night.
Just after starting today's hike, I took a few minutes to explore Charlies Bunion - a rock outcropping that bulges out from the primary mountain ridge like a podiactric nightmare.  I wonder just what Charlie's feet really looked like.  The rest of the day was spent rolling along the sawtooth-like trail undulations.  Some of my favorite parts of the trail on this section are the many short spans that connect small ridge peaks.  They look as if you are crossing a suspension bridge of earth with near vertical drops on both sides of the narrow sagging pathway.  Winds blowing up one side and down the other serve to complete the illusion.
Also, somewhere around mid-afternoon, I completed 218.9 miles of the AT as measured from Springer Mountain.  This is one tenth of the entire 2189.8 mile trail!  Only 1970.9 miles to go!
When I arrived at the Tri-Corner Knob shelter (while still on the lam from the Ranger Patrol), I found an unusual but welcome situation.  2 men and 10 women!  Welcome because none of them looked remotely capable of the snore-fest experienced last night.
Understand clearly, this was NOT some sordid sorority pajama party.  I am pretty sure that eight of the ten women here are older (some much older) than 52-year-old, happily-married-and-fully-fidelitous me (wife, I love you!).  The other two are teen-aged daughters of the other guy at the shelter.  They are from Chicago.  The crowd includes the two sisters from Wisconsin, Dee and Dawn, from the shelter last night, a group of four from Nebraska, and two others from - i dunno - Florida maybe?  It would be rude to ask, but a few of these ladies must be, at a minimum, 65.  Maybe 70.  Good for them!  I am inspired, and maybe a bit humbled, and possibly even somewhat shamed, to have them out here conquering the same mountain trails I have struggled to complete.
Because we are at maximum shelter capacity of 12 people, I am considering setting up my tent to stealth camp, but the forecast has rain and there seems to be plenty of room on the two decks of the shelter bunks.

Today started with a little rain.  Not enough to pull out the rainjacket, but just enough to remind me that a major hurricane is on its way.  The collective consensus of the ad-hoc amateur hurricane mobile phone data analysis team huddled in the shelter last night was that Hurricane Michael would be making landfall today and then will plow our direction(!).  Getting ahead of my schedule and finishing my hike a day early now looks like a genius idea.
I hiked through the morning and decided to stop for lunch at the Cosby Knob Shelter.  There, I cooked some ramen noodles, filled up on water and started to depart when the Wisconson sisters arrived.  We talked for a few minutes and I wished them well on the rest of their hike.  They were hiking on to Hot Springs, NC.
The rest of the downhill jog was unremarkable.  I exited the trail at Davenport Gap, on a gravel road, NC 284.  I knew that the road twisted downhill for another mile and a half to the Big Creek Ranger Station where my car was parked.  I had just started the roadwalk when, from behind me, I heard a vehicle crunching its way down the gravel road.  As the car approached, it slowed and the window came down.  A nice older couple asked if I knew how to get back to the interstate.  I gave them the directions, then asked if they could kindly let me hitch a ride down the hill to the ranger station.  They were only too happy to load me up and carry me for the 5 minutes it took to get to the bottom of the hill.  I thanked them, ensured they made the left turn to I-40, then walked the short distance to the car.  I never did come across any Rangers who cared where I was while in the park.  Maybe the manhunt continues even today...
The drive back to Alabama was rainy.  Hurricane Michael made landfall just about the time I exited the trail this afternoon, and is now churning and chewing its way across Georgia.  I wanted to be well out of its way before it made an appearance in the western Carolinas.

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619928,"Before the day could really be said to have started, I awoke to the sound of a car pulling into the trailhead parking at around 5am.  When hiking, I always try to camp well away from public roadways, just to have that extra insurance against becoming victim to a Saturday night pickup truck full of beer and poor judgement.  But here I am at 5am lying low in the back of my Highlander wondering about the intentions of the approaching vehicle.  It pulled into an empty space (thankfully not next to my car) and shut off the engine.  Then another car pulled in to the gravel lot and stopped behind the first one.  The occupants got out, but instead of arguing about which caliber makes the largest exit wound, the voices expressed relief to have ""finally arrived.""  Car doors opened and closed and everyone got into the second vehicle and drove away.  Form what I could tell, they were hikers who had driven for most of the night from somewhere far away and needed to park a car at the AT exit location while the second car was used to get everyone around to the starting point.  I love to backpack, but not at 5am.
So that was a long story, but was told primarily to remind me to follow my rules about camping near roads.
I emerged from the car around 6:30am and did my preflight check of all the things.  At a little after 7:00 I walked over to the Laughing Heart Hostel, which basically adjoins the parking lot, to see if I could locate ""Chuck.""  He was there, ready to get me over to Davenport Gap.  While driving, he told me about his hiking adventures.  His trail name is ""Chuck Norris"" due to a minor resemblance to the Walker, Texas Ranger star.  He looked as if he could possibly select a lucky child to throw into the sun - but I didn't ask.  I have a friend who really liked Walker, Texas Ranger because he said that each week he could get the ""violence of Texas justice and the morals of Christian teachings"" all in a single hour of television.
Chuck dropped me off at Davenport Gap and I started my hike.  Just before the first road crossing, I found some ""trail magic"" where some thoughtful soul had left several Gaterade bottles of multiple flavors for hikers to enjoy.  I selected the blue flavor.  It wasn't cold, but it was wet and it tasted good as I hiked the bridge across the French Broad river and crossed under Interstate 40.
Around lunch, I had completed my climb of Snowbird mountain and took the side trail over to the large humming whirring FAA VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) antenna transmitter located at the summit.  These transmitters are spaced all across the US to assist air traffic with navigation.  30 times a second the VOR signal sweeps around 360 degrees pumping out thousands of watts of signal power.  I noticed that my fillings were starting to melt, so I quickly got back to the trail and headed on towards Max Patch.
I had not seen a single other person all day (except the two motorcyclists at the VOR) until I neared the Max Patch summit.  Then I saw everyone.  Apparently its a thing to watch the sunset from the top of this huge grassy bald.  There is a parking lot about a half mile from the top and no less than 100 people were all up there milling around, taking photos, having picnics, flying drones, and even one couple getting married as the sun set over the far mountain range.  I set up my tent in one of the few clearings that were made by, I guess, the Forest Service for tent campers.  No hammock camping here.
The stars are now starting to emerge as all of the tourists retreat to their cars and head back to where-ever they came from.  I have opened my tent flap and can just now see the Milky Way emerge as it is sprawled across the center of the sky on this clear moonless evening.  From across the field, I heard a young woman camper yell ""I just saw a comet!  Did you guys see that?""  I did not correct her.","Davenport Gap

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620007,"This morning I awoke as the tent interior began to brighten.  I needed to get a dry, clean change of clothes from my pack, so I slipped on my camp shoes and crawled out of my tent wearing just my t-shirt and boxer shorts.  I could see the sun beginning to rise in the east.  But as I reached my pack, I heard voices directly behind me - like really close behind me!  I turned to see no less than a dozen people with phone cameras at eye level positioned just a few meters away - all apparently watching me wander around my small camp area in my boxers.  After a moment of shock, I realized they were not there to spy on me, but rather to see the sunrise.  Like the sunset, its apparently a thing to watch the sunrise from the top of this huge grassy bald - and some careless camper in his undershorts was ruining their view!  Truthfully, I don't think any of them paid me any attention.
I got back into the tent, changed into today's fashionable hiking ensemble, crammed tent and everything else into the pack, and was hiking away from the sunrise club within about 10 minutes.  I decided to have breakfast at the first shelter past Max Patch just to get away from the crowd.
The rest of the day was unremarkable.  I have never had a hiking day where I saw no other hikers, but for both yesterday and today, I had the trail all to myself.  I have always felt relatively safe on the trail because, until this trip, I had faith that should something serious happen like a broken ankle, a bad spill off the trial shoulder, or even a wildlife encounter such as snake bite or bee sting reaction, some other hiker would be along within an hour or so to provide assistance.  Now I'm not so sure.  And, of course, today was also the day I saw a rattlesnake sunning himself on the trial.  See the photo section of this blog for proof.  I was very careful to step far around his sleeping area.
I decided early this morning that I would try to hike the 20 miles from Max Patch to Hot Springs and then make the drive home tonight rather than spending another night on the trial.  I LOVE being out here, but I also love being with my wife and kids.
At about 6pm, I staggered into the Laughing Heart Hostel and found Chuck to say that I had completed the hike and was off the trail.  He offered the hostel's shower should I want to clean up before making the drive home.  I did and I did.
I'm already planning the next trip which I would like to make from Hot Springs, NC to Erwin, TN - a distance of about 70 miles.  I'm guessing that would take me about 5 full hiking days.  I'm just not sure when I will be able to make it happen considering my employment commitments.  Maybe during Christmas break (?).","Max Patch

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632133,"This year I successfully logged ZERO MILES on the Appalachian Trail.  This is an extremely proud personal accomplishment.  With the COVID-19 virus causing global trouble, I decided early in the year that I would attempt this difficult and daunting personal goal.  I read of others who were hiking the AT in 2020 that made the controversial decision to avoid tacking this challenge and simply kept on hiking.  No judgement here; that's their decision.  For me, it was matter of challenging myself to do things that I know are difficult but personally fulfilling.
I knew it would take endurance, fortitude, commitment, and stamina, but I also knew it was achievable.  Was I tempted to slack-off and cheat on my commitment?  OF COURSE I WAS!  Breezy summer weekends with sunny days and starry nights, employment leave needing to be used, packs of Pop-Tarts reaching their expiration date; these all conspired to tempt me into cheating.  But I endured.  I persevered.  I stayed home.  And, as I write this on 31 December, I can proudly say that I am one of the elite members of the zero-mile year club for 2020.
Having now succeeded in this accomplishment, I am pretty sure I will not attempt it again.  I am no longer a young man.  I must admit that my age is catching up with me and, for my own good, will likely go back to my old habits of backpacking when the urge hits me.  I'll definitely get vaccinated when its offered, but then will call it quits.  Here's to more miles in 2021.*** HAPPY NEW YEAR *** to all!","

Deep Gap
I woke up at about 3am this morning to the sound of a big RV pulling into the Hot Springs parking lot - directly behind the truck in which I was sleeping and fully blocking me in.  I planned on leaving the parking area early and thus had a decision to make - do I risk startling the driver at 3am with a ""Pssst!  Hey - yeah, over here - do you mind moving your RV?  I gotta leave in a few hours and don't want to bother you in the morning,"" or do I just go back to sleep knowing that I will have to knock on the RV in the morning and say ""Pssst!  Hey - yeah, out here - do you mind moving your RV?  I gotta leave now and wish I had asked you to move the RV last night.""  So I opened the back of the truck's camper shell and said ""Psst!  Hey - yeah, over here - no, no, NO - PUT THE GUN DOWN PLEASE - I'm just trying to ask you to move your RV.""  They were very understanding and moved the RV.  There was no gun.
I drove to Sam's Gap under I-26, parked the truck, and immediately found my shuttle driver who drove me right back over to Hot Springs.  I hiked through town, then across the French Broad river.  Just past the river, the trail ducks down an embankment to the French Broad riverbank and begins to parallel the river while climbing up Lovers' Leap.  The Rich Mountain Lookout Tower was a nice diversion for the day.  I ended up camping this evening at a dry campsite just off the trail near Deep Gap.","Hot Springs, NC (273.4)

I'm not feeling too inspired to write much for today's hike.  A few of the highlights of the day:
- Howard's Rock.  There's a long, high ridge that has great views on a clear day (like today).  It obviously took great effort to develop and establish this section of trail along that high ridge.  Somewhere along that ridge, there's a plaque to a guy named Howard McDonald, ""Master Trail Builder,"" dated 2015.  Near the rock, there was a laminated page attached where hikers could read about Howard and his dedication in building and maintaining the AT trails and shelters, including the five years it took to work the ridge trail.  Howard is just one of an army of trail maintenance volunteers who keep this trail in great shape.  NEVER pass a trail maintenance worker without saying ""thank you!""
- I passed the 300 mile mark somewhere past this ridge.  Someone had arranged some twigs on the side of the trail to spell out the number 300.  I was tempted to add ""or 482.803 kilometers,"" but did not have enough twigs.
- There's another portion of the trail that passes over a peak called ""Big Butt.""  Write your own joke.  Along this trail, there's a huge tall monolithic rock that seems to just be standing there and is split with a crack down the middle.  Again write your own joke - but know that this is NOT the big butt.  That's on up the hill at the top of the peak.  There is also a Big Butt Bypass trail.  
- And also take a moment to pay your respects to Howard Bassett, age 83, who hiked the trail in 1968.  Doing the math, he was 64 when he did his hike.  His ashes are located by a marble marker near the trail.  I've often considered making a request of my family to allow my cremains to spend the rest of eternity near the trail as this outdoorsman did.  But no marker, please.
- I reached Flint Mountain Shelter around 4pm.  It was still light, so I set up my tent behind the shelter on the only patch of level ground in the area.  Dinner was early and I retired to my tent just after sundown.","Deep Gap (286.2)

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644695,"I started off this morning earlier than most of the crowd staying in the shelter.  I was in such a rush to get going, I got around the first corner and started up a hill before I realized I had left my hiking poles jammed in the ground near the picnic table at which I put on my boots.  I turned around and saw one of the shelterers running up behind me with said poles.  ""Hey!  You forgot these!""  Trail people are good people.
I have gotten into the habit of getting up, packing my gear, and hiking for a while so that I can locate a good spot for breakfast.  Today was one of my favorites.  I found a set of stairs that allow an easy crossing of a pasture fence.  The perfect place to set up the kitchen.  Oatmeal and dried cherries.  Coffee (always coffee).
From the crossing, the trail begins up a large hill.  About half way up, I found a small cemetery with two headstones.  One stone marks the final resting place of Joe Riddel who, per the dates on his marker, lived to see 96 years.  The other stone honors Dorothy Hensley.  If the dates on her marker are correct, she died 8 days short of seeing her 100th birthday.  As I get older myself, I think less about my quantity of life (how old I hope to live) and more about maximizing my quality of life in those later years.  I wonder what kind of struggles and joys Ms. Hensley had as she approached a century on this world in 1965.
I only had about 11 miles to hike today, so a leisurely stop for lunch was an easy decision.  The location I picked was the overlook with the uninspired name of High Rocks.  But it does live up to its name with a very nice view of the valley below.  After this, a brief downhill hike to Sams Gap brought me back to the truck and ended this section hike.","Flint Mountain Shelter (307.0)

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644696,"Another long weekend, another quick section hike!
I started this one by parking at Sams Gap late in the afternoon on Sunday, 26 September.  I usually plan to leave a car at the north end of my section hike and have a shuttle pick me up and transport me back around to the south end so that I can hike back to my vehicle and leave as soon as I get back to the car without the hassle of waiting around for the shuttle driver (or worse, them waiting around (or not) for me).  This time, my dear wife is planning on picking me up near Erwin, TN after which we will spend a few days in Asheville, NC.  But first, some backpacking...
Since I arrived in the late afternoon, I only planned on hiking a mile or so until I found a good camping spot.  As the sun set behind me, I was treated to golden hour lighting of the mountain ridge that defines the border between Tennessee and North Carolina.  As the sun set and the air cooled, I started thinking about where to camp.  I crossed through a minor gap that included an old forest service road and then up a hill to find a small meadow clearing that would make for a good overnight location.  I set up my tent, had dinner, and then got comfortable to watch the stars emerge.
It is a personal policy of mine to avoid camping near roads.  As a hiker, I generally plan my days so that I am done by around 5pm and enjoy an evening of rest.  But not all travelers on the nearby roads share this agenda.  Should any passing driver decide that 3am would be a great time to wander around on the Appalachian Trail, I want to be camping far enough from the road that the nocturnal explorer has a chance to think better of their 3am decision and abandon the effort.
However, while I did not initially think the rutted, graveled forest road would be a likely drive for anyone this evening, around 9:00, just as it was getting really dark, I heard the low rumbling of a truck engine approaching from below my meadow camp.  It grew louder and closer.  About the time I could see headlights, I started to wonder if my tent was visible from the road's location down in the gap.  The truck pulled up to where the trail crossed the road, then stopped.  I will never know the actual intentions of the driver, why he stopped there at the gap, or if he/she was even aware of my presence just up the hill, watching, from about 50 yards away.  The truck then reversed, backed into a small clear area, lurched forward, and drove back down the road in the direction from which it came.  I was not happy.  Again, I have renewed my policy to never camp near roads - even old abandoned forest service roads.
The rest of the evening was spent listening for truck engines and watching the Milky Way gently emerge from the darkening skydome above.  I slept soundly once finally in my tent.","Sam's Gap at I-26 (318.2)

Doctor Photon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644697,"I started today by packing away my dew-soaked tent and continuing my climb up Big Bald.  Along the way, I noticed the map showed an entire subdivision of lots and houses just over the ridge to the south of the trail.  Without the map, you would never know there is a full hillside of cabins and houses within 50 meters of the trail.  I took a side path up to the ridgetop just to prove to myself that there was a neighborhood up there.  And there was.  Within a brief 60 second climb, I had suddenly been transported from the remote, secluded trail environment to a small comfortable neighborhood, complete with all the regular neighborhood trappings of mailboxes, paved roads, driveways, and flowerbeds.  I turned and made the short hop back over the ridge and down to the trail.  Instant wilderness.  Weird.
[For the record, this is the Wolf Laurel Community, a 5000 acre gated neighborhood that has a country club, golf course, community center, riding stables, etc.  Nice if you can afford it.]   
I continued on for another mile or two to the peak of Big Bald.  Its a little like Max Patch, but not nearly as accessible by the college crowd seeking a fun spot to drink beer and watch a sunset.  Because of that, I think I prefer Big Bald over Max Patch.  It is very secluded.  I stopped to enjoy breakfast at the peak.  It was windy; low-flying clouds zipped by at just above head level.  They looked more like a light fog blowing by than actual clouds.  I was alone and had the bald peak all to my self.
I hiked on until Spivey Gap where the trail crosses Highway 19.  I stopped for lunch and looked at my map to plan the afternoon and consider where I may want to camp tonight.  The No Business Knob shelter seemed to be at about the right distance.  I like staying near shelters because there is usually a good reliable consistent water source available.  After lunch, I hiked on until I found the No Business Knob shelter.  This was such a sad, unimpressive shelter, I made the decision to fill my water bladder and hike on.  I eventually found Temple Hill Gap.  It also had an old forest road running through it, but my spidey sense seemed to indicate that no trucks had driven this passage in weeks if not months or years.  Another night on the trail.","Street Gap (320.5)

The morning weather included low cloud ceilings, so the trail down to the Nolichucky and Erwin, TN was foggy and misty.  I reached a paved road and saw the bridge, but also saw Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel.  Finally time for breakfast.  I crossed the road, entered the covered porch, and parked my pack on a picnic table.  Before setting up the stove, I took a minute to visit the small shop and bought a few Snickers bars.  Apparently, Uncle Johnny is known for the great deals they have on Snickers bars.  Trail magic!
With breakfast and coffee done, I had a chance to clean the dishes using potable water in the hostel wash basin.  Also porcelain was available.  Nice.
I crossed the Nolichucky and started the 8.2 mile gradual climb up to my planned exit at Indian Grave gap.  Along the way, I came across the Curley Maple Gap.  Very nice, new, clean, big.  In hindsight, had I known how nice this shelter is compared to the sad No Business Knob shelter, maybe I could have replanned my hike to stay here.
A few hours later, I found myself at Indian Grave Gap.  The plan, at this point, was to call Wife and wait for a pickup to then head over to Asheville, NC for a mini vacation to celebrate 29 years of tolerating my backpacking habit.  But she was still a few hours away, so I made the executive decision to attempt a hitchhike into Erwin for coffee and a comfortable place to wait for my ride.  The problem, however, was that the road through Indian Grave Gap is very lightly traveled.  Just as I was about to decide to stay put, a solo middle-aged female hiker came from the AT trail to the north and unlocked her car.  Time to shine!  The challenge here was to be charming, conversant, but most importantly, nonthreatening.  I made some small talk, asked about the views to the north of the road, and eventually asked for a ride into town.  She somewhat reluctantly agreed, but made it clear that she did not want to drive too far out of her way.  I negotiated a drop off at the Steel Rails Coffe House in downtown Erwin.  I offered to pay her, but she politely declined.  After many thanks, I collected my pack, got some coffee, called Wife, and claimed a spot at a small outdoor table in a quaint tiny city park next to the coffee shop.  A few hours (and a short nap) later, Wife arrived.  Off we drove for a weekend in Asheville.  The Biltmore mansion is even nicer than the Curley Maple Gap shelter.","Temple Hill Gap (338.9)
