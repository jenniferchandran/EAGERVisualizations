Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581664,We did our 15 miles today although we were really slow. But the trail was very rocky. We met about 20 Thru hikers today and at the very end we had hoped to stay in a motel which was closed. But thankfully they left an igloo cooler full of water so we could fill up since there was no where to fill up. Sidewinder ( my hiking partner/daughter) started to not feel well the last couple miles so we took a break and chatted with some thru hikers and then trudged on to se up for camp. It was just about dark. We are now in our tent snuggling with our 2 dogs. We are hoping to do 15 more miles tomorrow ending in little gap.Â -Yardsale and Sidewinder.,"Delaware Water Gap

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581677,This morning we saw 2 deer at our campsite. Pretty cool. Saw another 2 while hiking. Walked to Leroy A Smith shelter and had to walk a mile round trip to get water. We were out so we needed to do it. Well we were trucking right along and then we heard the Thunder. We kept walking in the rain for about an hour. Then we saw a campsite and decided to set up there. Although it was 2 miles short of where we were planning on going. We are bunkered down for the night.,"Wind Gap

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581678,This day was the most exhausting day. We had three gaps to descend and climb. Happy to see trail magic consisting of soda and water. Made it to bake oven knob shelter. I think my dog summer was having some heat exhaustion. She got sick. But all is well today. Spend the night with a father and 16 year old son. A bunch of NOBO made it in before dark. Then at 4 am more came in who hiked at night. They all were enjoying the drinks at the Summit. Pretty good night at the shelter considering the rained.,"tent site before little gap road

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581680,"Started out with not having packed enough food. Plans dont always turn out like they should and we should pack an error day just in case. We had planned to hit a restaurant the night before and fell short because of the rain. We managed by eating our snacks. We also knew we were going to hike 6 miles and eat at the Blue Mountain Summit. We concured Bear rocks and Knifes edge early on our hike today, then lunch at the Summit. We got there 20 min before they opened. Tied the dogs out back in the shade, and filled up on water. The dogs were so content just laying there. First thing we ordered was Water, Soda and an Alcoholic drink. They tasted so good. It was extremely humid toady. We also got the dogs burgers for their hard work. Then headed off toward the Allentown Shelter. As we got near, it started thundering and lightning. A bit worried but, that just turned to all rain. We walked the next 7 miles in the rain. In the beginning it wasnt bad, by the end we had enough. Our water proof boots were soaking wet. Thankfully we had my husband waiting for us as we walked off the trail. We came home showered, unpacked our wet gear, and ate a hot meal. Unfortunately we are going to have to leave my dog Summer home on the next leg of the trip. She was showing sings of fatigue and with further examination, her back toe nails have the flesh rubbing thru. She will stay home for some R&R.","Bake oven Road

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581681,"We had a little late start leaving the house. Got to the trail @ 9:00. Started the hike to the Pinnacle. Normally it would take someone 3 hours to get there. We managed in 2:15. It was a steep hike up a nice grassy lane. We must be getting better. Enjoyed a snack and the view. Then peeked in at Pulpit rock for another view. We worked like mother truckers and put on the miles. We hit the switchbacks into Port Clinton. Going down and pretty intense. Our feet hurt so bad and I have like 5 blisters on one foot and 3 on the other from all the rocks. As I sit hear writing my feet are throbbing. Anyway, when you come off the trail it would be say to hike up route 61. That's what my daughter thought. Nope you need to go under bridge and go another half mile into town. On the way we hit a small stream flowing into river. It dealt so great to put our feet in it. Then we walk thru Port Clinton a guy gave us a ride to end of town. Another local offered us to use the spigot to get water. The we were so happy to meet up with my husband and friends for dinner at the hotel. It was amazing and so good. As we are hiking. We find that we are so hungry but when we try to eat we can only eat about half. Crazy. We were once again joined up with Kara's dog Rhone after the day of R&R. I am missing my dog Summer but she is better off at home at this point. But just to report she is doing a lot better today. So then back to the Pavillion to join 2 older hikers Brokeback and Pounds. 2 chatty souls. So unpacking to go to sleep I can not find my sleeping bag anywhere. Imy husband said I didn't leave it at home. The only other place I opened my pack was at a shelter to eat lunch. Hmmmmm. So in the morning I am off with a shuttle to buy a sleeping bag. My friend Dee offered to come. But I'll use my Frogg Toggs tonight as a cover. A thunder storm rolled in than god we were under the pavillion and at 12 a hiker rolled in.","Eckville

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581682,"Started with getting up a 6 am. My friend Dee picked us up and took us to breakfast at 3C's resturant. At this point it is kinda comical to watch us walk. We look like 2 little old ladies who can hardly walk. After about an hour it eases up. Dee was also nice enough to to take me to Walmart to buy another sleeping bag. It's not at home so it was either left at a shelter when we pulled out our lunch or it was stole at the pavilion when we went to dinner. Prolly at the shelter. We packed up and tended to our blisters. On our way out of town a car pulled up, they had trail magic for Paw Patrol. We were on the trail by 8:30. The trail travels this steep incline out if Port Clinton. The steepest we have done. It was tough. It definitely slowed our time today. We hiked all day with 2 breaks and 30-40 min lunch and also to re bandage our blisters. 2 more have reared their ugly head. I think from compensating for other blisters. Overall it was a good hiking day other than the rocks,gnats and blisters. We also met a lot of thru hikers who were headed to Maine. A funny story.... Our trail dog, Rhone aka Paw Patrol, has been teased by chipmunks all through our hike. Well one zipped out on the trail ran into her legs and made a u turn n ran back in the woods before Paw Patrol even knew what happened to her. Another is when she runs in the ferns after them, she looks like a lion with ferns all around her neck. Anyway We hiked to 183 be was greeted with trail magic. A cooler full of goodies freeze pops and lemon seltzer water. We also were happy to make it to camp before getting any rain. According to the weather it was going to rain at 1:30. While Kara started cooking I set up the tent. We then hung our bear bag(food) in a tree. It only took 2 attempts. Checked in at home and as I am writing this it is thundering like crazy. All I can say is hopefully we stay dry. Ill let ya know tomorrow. Oh ya and we smell pretty bad now.","Port Clinton

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581683,Woke up early and dry. Imagine that. We had to pack up our wet tent and try to dry out later. We hit the trail and hike about 9 miles to 501 shelter. We passes a youth group of kids and when we told them that today we will have hiked 100 miles. They were amazed. We got to 501 shelter and met up with 2 guys that are brothers. One is just hiking a week with the brother. We all ordered Pizza and it was delivered to the parking lot near the shelter. We chilled for about 2 hours. Kara got a very cold shower from an over head hose. We then hiked 4 more miles to William Penn shelter which is a pretty big be has a loft. At this point 3 guys are already sleeping down stairs so Kara is taking the other area down stairs since she has the dog. I will sleep upstairs and another guy and one guy in a hammock. Kara had her 4th slip today on rocks. Thankfully she just slid and fell on her pack. Me on the other hand had a good fall early on the hike. The hiking poles went flying and I had a hard time getting up because of the pack. Hence my trail name is Yardsale. Time for bed or my mat and sleeping bag. The whole shelter is going to sleep at 8:45.,"Campsite near 501

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581684,"The day started pretty early as all the hikers got up and started eating breakfast. Our breakfast was leftovers that we had from the 501 shelter. Where Kara ordered pizza and I got a medium ham and cheese calzone. That means we actually got 3 meals out of that one order. Of course we had to pack it with us. 3 guys were headed NOBO and Dr. John and his brother Matt and ourselves were headed SOBO. They left before us. We had to hike another .3 miles to get water before we even started hiking. That doesn't sound like much but after 8 days of hiking and our feet killing us. We needed to have 2 liters knowing there's were creeks ahead. We hiked to the first overlook and had a snack. We are trying to have 2 snacks before lunch because we realize now that we are feeling so bad and stumbling and careless and it is because we are not consuming enough calories. When we try to eat we are starving but when we actually eat we can only eat half. The hikers say this is common in the beginning. We eventually hiked to Swatara gap. There was a really nice bridge and the river so we soaked our aching feet in the river while we ate out lunch consisting of a tortilla with peanut butter,honey, almonds and dried fruit. We planed on hiking to the next shelter and taking a break. We also heard from other hikers that Dr John and his brother were there. We had a really big climb up the mountain and halfway down the other side. We found an old cemetery that 3 people were buried there from 1845. The one was a native of England and died at Gold Mine Gap. Pretty interesting. As we got to the sign for the shelter it was another .3 miles to the shelter. We decided to rest there instead of walking back. Then came our 2 hiker friends. They were planning on hiking 2 more miles and setting up camp. We were as well. Eventually we hiked 2 miles and couldn't find a spot so we hiked another mile and eventually just found a place in the middle of the woods. It feels so good to rest our feet. Dinner was Alfredo noodles and chicken. We are up in the mountain above Fort Indian Town gap. I swear it sounds like they are practicing with machine guns. Well I can't check I. With anyone tonight. I have no cell service.","William Penn Shelter

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581685,"We started hiking at 8:30 put in a good few miles. We made it to Yellow Springs Campsite which was an old abandoned village. There was a blue trail that lead to an old abandon mine shaft. We went off trail to see it. There was a mailbox for hikers to journal. We left a note for Dr John and his brother saying we were ahead of them. Eventually they met us when we took a rest. They had to harass us. Eventually we did catch up to them at another location. We had 2 miles to go. We all were struggling but we carried on. We passes a head trail master on the trail. He was asking us how the trail was Etc. We decended down a huge mountain. Only problem with that is, there is always a huge climb up the other side. As it was in this case. It was a struggle again today hiking. Just beside we are hiking SOBO doesn't mean it's down hill. It is a lot of up hill. I am sure the NOBO would disagree. Although our blisters are healing, it is still painful. Our heels are also killing is from all the pounding. We are now at Peters Mountain Shelter. It is a nice open double decker shelter with a privy and water 300 steps down. Everyone says it's a struggle to get water but we are going to have to do it. Dinner was rice and tuna. There are bear boxes hear so we don't have to hang out food. We are staying the night with 3 other hikers and Dr John and Matt. 7 all together. It's 8:00 and most are getting ready for bed. I am really missing my friends and especially my family, but I am really happy to share this experience with my daughter.","Campsite

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581687,"We decided we wanted to get up early so that we could get Dunncanon and enjoy a few hours in town. Our 2 friends had left an hour before us hoping to get breakfast before 11 in town. We hit the trail by 7:30. It was a brisk morning. But believe me, as soon as we started hiking we were sweating. The trail was pretty normal with a few rock crawls. At one point we hike up a pretty good hill and just before the trail came out to a road. There was soda and a sign that said ""Rocksylvania pit stop"". It tasted so good. We then crossed the parking lot and one the other side was a nice older couple handing out water and Ham and cheese sandwiches. We thanked them but had to pass since we just had breakfast shortly before. The decent in Duncannon was huge with a lot is switchbacks. It was intense and felt like we were never going to come off the mountain. We crossed the railroad tracks then the Susquehanna river by foot bridge. It was pretty neat. We the had the 3 mile walk thru Duncannon. We were stopped by some locals just chatting about our hike. As we walk down the street there is an ice cream shop we couldn't pass up. Even Rhone got ice cream. We took our boots off there since we had a long walk thru town. AsI bent over to pick up my hiking sticks the pack already on my back, my boot end up wacking me in the head. It looked like a comedy show. We then proceeded to the post office yo get our resupply box. After packing up all our food. My gosh out packs weigh a ton. We also sent home the things we didn't need anymore. While there several locals chatted with us and one even offered to drive us to the grocery store. We were good with our resupply. But people sure are nice. We then went to the famous Doyle Hotel know to hikers. When we are walking in we meet ""Tuna"" a SOBO hiker turns out he is the 3rd SOBO, Dr Jon and a women named Chainsaw is ahead. They are trying hard to catch her. We go inside and Dr Jon is chatting with ""Bag of Tricks"" a man who was a thru hiker 20 years ago and does Shuttle and volunteers a lot along the trail. Even all the way up where I live near Eckville. We sit with the crew and have drinks dinner and catch up on past and present hiking stories. It was a good time. Kara and I took advantage of the showers at the Doyle at. $10. A piece. But it was so worth it. We then hit the trail for another almost 4 miles to the trail leading to Cove Mountain Shelter. Our friends were there and said the shelter was full. They were taking a break then hiking on another 3 or so miles. We chilled with them and then took a picture since we probably won't see them any more. We then went to see what the camping was like at the shelter. There are about 5-6 people camping. We got all set up just before dark. Oh ya and the first thing that happens when we arrive is the boots come off and our camp shoes go on. I almost didn't bring any. I am so glad I did. Our blisters are almost healed thankfully. We also arrived on a trail name for Kara. It is Sidewinder. As always there is a story behind it.","Peters Mountain Shelter
",Cove Mountain Shelter,"Aug 05, Fri",15
Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581688,"I was happy to wake up and find this is didn't rain like it was supposed to. Got our food out of the bear box at the shelter. Had coffee and oatmeal for breakfast. Kara walked to the spring while I checked out the 2 seater composting privy. We packed up and hit the trail around 8:30. Why is it that there is always a steep hill at the shelters. I think they just want to torture us even more.Â Â Â We put a few miles in then came down off the mountain and into a meadow. Other than being hot, it was a pleasant change from being in the woods. It was rather quiet today. We only passed 2 guys out day hiking. Of course once you come down you know you have to go up. It was quite a mountainside we had to hike up. I think it even seems harder now because our muscles are so fatigued. We finally made it to Darlington Shelter to have lunch. We decided we were so exhausted so we would take a few minutes and rest. A day hiker popped in to chat. Well it was a good thing we took some time because while we were here a passing thunderstorm rolled thru. That lasted about 20 min. So Sidewinder and Rhone are resting in the bunk at the moment. We then headed out into the woods again. Although it wast that strenuous it was hot and felt like we were in a rainforest and just seemed so mundane and quite boring. I think we had enough of the woods. We actually were hoping to see a rattle snake a bear or something to liven things up. Eventually we came out into a farm field and were In a cow pasture. We walked through the pasture up a stile. A bridge like thing over a pasture fence. Never seen that before. Crossed route 81 and through a bunch more of Cumberland Valley fields. Eventually coming out on route 11. We knew there was a hotel a half mile up the street. We were hoping to hitch hike a ride to the hotel. We get to the first light and at the intersection is the Days Inn Shuttle bus. We flagged him down asked if they allow dogs and they did. We were so happy. It was perfect timing.that driver sure did get a tip. Then at the hotel I ask for the hiker discount. He said $70. Usually 120 since it was the truck show. But the shuttle guy told him to give us the discount. Oh ya. Sidewinder jumped in the shower while I did all the laundry. Then I showered. Sidewinder had no clothes to wear till laundry was done. That was funny. Then we went next door and had a great meal at the diner. Even trail dog Rhone got a big burger. She seemed to be in slow motion today. I think she even needed a break and stay at a hotel. Well it's early to bed and back on the trail in the AM.","Cove mountain Shelter

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581689,"Our night in the hotel was so nice. Almost the best shower I ever had. Wish I had a shaver to do my legs and armpits. But oh well. We enjoyed the continental breakfast and the staff we very nice and knew we were hikers. So the were sure to give us yogurt, water, even bacon and sausage. Rhone our trail dig watched TV in the room. We hit the trail by 8:40. Our hiking in the morning went real fast because we were hiking through farm fields, pastures, and wood lines. That was about 8 miles. As we were coming to Boiling Springs our friend Carolee and her boys drove out to spend an overnight and fish and spend time with us. It was so special that they would include us in their day. As we were walking here they come walking towards us on the trail. It was amazing. We then went to the ATC office then too lunch. We proceeded to all hike a few miles to Center point knob. When we were there we saw our first ridge runner. He is kinda like a patrol on the trail for the Appalachian. He works 10 days straight then 4 off. He covers 70 miles of trail. This is where we parted ways with our friends. From there we continued up and down 4 peeks which had our hearts racing and the sweat pouring off of us. We finally made it to a campsite around 7 pm which was good considering we spent a lot of time with our friends. The hardest part at night is hanging our food so the Bears don't get it. So how do you hang it when you are in a Forrest of pine trees with no limbs. It wasn't easy. Also my little piggy toes are finally not screaming they wanna go home. Half gallon challenge tomorrow.","Carlise

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581690,"We started off a little late. It felt so good to get some rest. We were on the trail by 9am. We hiked about 3 miles to a little general store. We stocked up on Gatorade and water. We wouldn't see much water for 7 miles. We hiked up another 2 peaks and then down into Pine Grove State park. What a nice area. As we are walking in on the gravel road, written in the gravel is my name. How weird is that. We stopped at the Appalachian trail museum. That was really meet to see. We then went to the store and did our own Half Gallon Challenge. Hikers that do the whole trail are challenged to eat a half gallon of ice cream. This is near where the half way part of the trail is. Since we were only doing Pennsylvania me and Sidewinder decided to share the gallon. We rested, charger our phones and continued on our hike for another 3.6 miles a total of 15 miles for the day. Again there is no cell phone service. We are sharing the shelter with 2 older gentlemen. One in a hammock one in shelter. It is 7pm and they are going to sleep all ready. Guess it will be an early night for us too. Oh ya. I now know what it feels like to be a turtle. Our trail dog Rhone tripped me and I went down. I was trying to get back up but all I could do was sit there flapping about like a turtle trying to flip over. These darn packs are heavy and feel like a turtle shell.","Campsite near Route 94

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581691,"We started off of the latest we ever have at 9:30. Sidewinder was a bit sleepy. Our hike was pretty uneventful. Everyone we were passing said it is so easy it is down hill. Ya right. There were quite a few inclines. But we did have a lot of walking on the ridge of the mountains with little to no rocks. A welcome relief. We stopped for lunch and a break at Birch run shelter. We had out in probably 7 miles. Our lunch consisted of salmon and almonds wrapped in a tortilla and some craisins. Water is getting slim again so we are trying to carry enough with us. We also encountered a few deer today on the trail. Some of the gravel road crossings are saying that they will be closed for an Endoro race in September. As we continued hiking it started to rain. We donned our rain gear for a while. It didn't last too long. As we walked into Quarry Gap shelter it is beautiful. It is log cabin style with 2 separate bunk areas and a picnic table in between. A fire pit, real flowers in pots. A bunch of tent platforms, bear box, privy, a bench swing and a stream near by. Luxury at its best. We got our miles done at 3:56 pm. Quit a little shy of 15 because the state park is next and we hear you can't stay there. We would have to go another 6 miles. So far tonight we are staying with the older gentleman again. His name is ""Just Paul"" We are not looking forward to tomorrow because we have a huge mountain to climb. But oh well. This has been our life the last 2 weeks. Tomorrow is our last full day.

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581692,"Guest Writer: SidewinderHello all! I figured it's about time I make my appearance in the journal for everybody. Last night was quite an eventful night. Our shelter had a metal roof and nuts kept falling from the trees and banging on the roof. As soon as we'd fall asleep, a nut would fall and we'd jump out of our sleeping bags. It sounded like bullets! This carried on for quite some time. After an early start, the first leg of our hike was a 2,000 foot elevation climb to the highest ridge in Pennsylvania. Sadly, there was no water anywhere on the ridge, so our snack break consisted of walking all the way down the mountain and back up on a side trail to get water. Needless to say, it was not much of a break. Sitting at lunch on a small lookout, we saw yellow and blue lizards all over the rocks. Who knew that Pennsylvania had lizards? After descending the ridge, we reached Old Forge Picnic Grounds where water was available through a spigot. These spigots are like shrines to us on the trail, especially since my water filter got clogged a few days ago. It barely trickles any water through. 5 miles later, we reached Deer Lick Shelters where we will be spending the night. It's our last night, and we finally made a fire.Â 

Overall, this journey has been the most physically demanding task I have ever accomplished. I have experienced every possible emotion along the way, but we did it! After 4.7 miles tomorrow, we will cross the Mason-Dixon Line, completing the entire Appalachian Trail of PA. So many people on the trail helped carry us through, especially our trail buddy Dr. Jon who wrote a very motivating note to us in one of the trail registers we passed today.
As for our next adventure, Mom and I have decided we will be completing the AT through West Virginia which has a total of 7 miles of trail! Anyone want to join?","Quarry Gap Shelter

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581693,"We started of the day by 8:30 feeling exhilaratied knowing it was our last day. As we left Deer Lick Shelter and we were strolling right along, then comes yet another hill. It was again one that took a lot of energy on our tired muscles. We finally made it up to the top and as we are going thru the woods, our trail dog was acting crazy like she knew it was our sat day too. She was running in the leaves,rolling, and pulling at sticks and running off.Â We continued and crossed a few roads, then again another Hill. I thought we were done with hills. Sidewinder and I have decided we don't need to exercise anymore, we have done enough for the rest of our life. After we come down the hill it is not too much further until we come to the Mason Dixion Line. We were so excited that our journey has come to an end. 230 miles and we walked it all and then some, if you count the treks we took to get to creeks, shelteres and resupply. We signed the journal one final time and took some pictures. Then we had to walk another .2 miles, again up a small hill, to meet our ride. We waited about an hour for my Dad to come get us. It was so good to see him and know we were truley done.Â 
I had to tie so much credit to Sidewinder for her hard work and to persevering on this journey.. WE DID IT!!!!!!!

I also would like to give special thanks to Glen, Dee, Barb, Jesse, Carolee and boys, and my Dad for all they did for us while we hiked the Pennsylvania Appalachian, we couldn't have done it with out you.","Deer Lick Shelter

Â  At the park there were a lot of hikers eating lunch. So we figured we would pass a lot of hikers today.Â  It started off pretty flat but quiet quickly there was a very steep climb.Â  It was then that Sudewinder and I said "" I thought we were never going to do this again"". But we made it up the hill and another and another.Â  We did pass a thru a field or two.

Sidewinder woke me up shortly after midnight telling me she was going to throw up.Â  Need less to say we were in a double decker shelter in the pitch dark.Â  We also forgot to take our head lamps to bed. Luckily she was out of the shelter in time before she did the deed.Â  I grabbed all her gear and 3 Advil(since she had a bad headache) and she slept outside.Â  All the while, 2 of the hikers were up to use the privy and one was using her light to help us. Sidewinder told me in the morning we were going to the ER.Â  So I said my prayers for her and a few others of course.Â  Thank fully in the morning she woke up and was feeling pretty good. All of the hikers offered supplies to help with dehydration.Â  Although she drank 4 liters of water she just flushed it thru her system too quickly under the hot conditions and the trail terrain.Â  So we had some coffee and I had breakfast and packed up and hit the trail. Our plan was to hike to Pine knob shelter which was 8 miles.Â  Hopefully we could make it before the rain it looked like the rain pushed off until 1 and would end at 3.Â  That is exactly how it played out. So we ate lunch relaxed and chatted with Mya and calculator as he is now named. A few other came in as well. Also the privy at Pine Knob smelled so good, it had hand sanitizer and was kept clean. We decided to continue on.Â  The trail want too hard and the we could camp with 4 others we had met the night before. We stopped to see Annapolis Rocks which had a beautiful view. We also stopped at the original Washington monument. We saw a toad,snake, 3 fawn,a doe and a chipmunk.Â  Pretty many today. Finally after 14 miles we made it to Dahlgren hiker campground. It was around 7pm. There were about 8 tents set up. As we were going to the restrooms. A women came in with trail magic.Â  It was so nice. She had ice cream sandwiches,fresh berries and whipped cream.Â  Then after hearing that Sidewinder was dehydrated she gave her some electrolytes as well. Such a kind women. So we went and had a warm shower which was great, but would have been even better had we had some soap. I then made dinner for us. At home we put a pasta side dish in a freezer bag,then at camp we just add boiling water.Â  As I did this the flipping bag is leaking all over.Â  We I find out that Sidewinders cat raided her bags of food and poked holes in them.Â  As we are finally leaving in our tent at 9:30 we are hearing fireworks off in the distance.","Ensign Cowall shelter

Because of that I was up very early and decided to charge my phone since there is electric here.Â  I was surprised to see that all the hikers but one were still here.Â  Usually they like to get an early start because a lot of them are putting in 20 miles + and it is going to be hot.Â  A man named Manymiles is packing up, spoke to a nice German fella who was about 60. He loves it here. I right now it is 8 am and I am letting Sidewinder sleep in since she wasn't well yesterday. Â 
Â We hiked 10 miles today but it felt like forever. But we didn't start our hike until noon so that we could have this amazing brunch at Old South Mountain Inn.Â  It was so fancy there but they welcomed showered hikers.Â  On the start of our hike we hit a hill/mountain that was a mile long.Â  Although it wasn't that steep it was long. After that the trail leveled out for the most part.Â  We traveled thru Gathland State Park. It was really cool seeing all the war ruins.Â  When we came into the park and these 2 little boys came running and asked if we wanted trail magic.Â  We both had sodas since we just ate lunch. They wanted to know if we had trail names. We carried on and made it to Ed Garvey Shelter. It is again a full shelter and we took the upper deck.Â  But it has a back door so Sidewinder can run out and puke if she needs to (joking). We are dinner consisting ofÂ  rice side dish with sundries tomato tuna. I also had to do a bear hang and tried the PCT method.Â  Google it.Â  It works well. We are now hanging by a fire with a bunch of hikers.","

This happened several times thru the night. Eventually Sidewinder woke up at 5:30 am. This is a first for her. Â It actually worked out great because it was 93 degrees today. We hiked down a switchback into Harpers Ferry. It seemed like we would never get there. The last 3 miles were along the C&O canal. This was very pretty and a little monontonous. Â We knew our friend Dee was coming to be our trail Angel today. Â We all went to eat and looked in the local shops. We went to the outfitter in town, and I bought a new Neo Light air pad. My back has not been doing well sleeping so hopefully this helps. Â We then went to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and had our picture taken. Â The number each hiker coming thru. Each type of hiker(thru,section,flip flop) get a sequence of numbers. Â It was really neat experincing this. As we were walking in town it was cool running into several hikers that we crossed lathes with so far on this hike. Our Friend Dee had hotel arraignements at the Econo Lodge. It was luxury campoared to how we lived the past few days. So refreshing to get a shower and was out clothing. Â Not sure we can do this the rest of the hike. We then were able to go to dinner and get re supplied with our food. This would not have been so easy had it not been for our friend who we are so greatful for. She helped us as we reps led our food bag and now we are relaxing, drinking our wine and watching TV. Â I need to milk this as long as I can tonight. Â Tomorrow we will have a Nero day as well.

I ran to the lounge for coffee and juice.Â  Free breakfast and I was going to take advantage of it. Eventually we all ate. Late breakfast and layed around until check out. We then went to look for a few gifts and looked around town. The a place for lunch and had a few drinks. We said our good byes to Dee then went and relaxed by the river for a while.Â  We knew we were only hiking 6 miles so we did t have to leave early.Â  That should take about 3 hours plus break time.Â  We decided to give to another restaurant to full charge our phones and hydrate. By 3:45 we hit the trial out of Harpers Ferry going south.Â  We climbed up the steep town streets passed an pole church.Â  Funny thing is, in towns it has is so easy to get lost. They put the he trail makers so discreet that they are hard to find. Sidewinder says it's like I Spy. Anyway we crossed the river and headed up the mountain. It was the of the worst climb so far. It was a mile and a half up.Â  We normally do 2 miles an hour, it took us an hour and a half to the top. It was awful. Luckily for us as we walked the top of the mountain the wind picked up from a storm brewing. It did get a bit rocky but that was awesome compared to the climb. We saw 5 deer along this hike.Â  We got to Keys Gap where there is a gas station a quarter mile down the street. This took us 3 3/4Â  hours. We set up our tent because of the pending rain then ran for water at the station. Thankfully we did because we no sooner got back and the rain started.Â  We decided to use our food instead of buying at the store so we would have less weight in our pack.Â  Sidewinder isn't feeling the best and is questions if we should keep doing this if she doesn't feel good so much. I will try to encourage her.Â  She s me to no t do well in the heat.Â  So I went to hang the bear bag and I am coming back to the tent and I see a shadow low to the ground 2 feet from the tent.Â  Thankfully I had my light on me.Â  When I turned it on it was a skunk.Â  I just started yelling at it and thankfully it ran away.","Harpers Ferry

We should get going.Â  She still wasn't sure if she wanted to still continue the hike feeling ill so much.Â  I ran for coffee at the gas station and decided to drink it there. Otherwise I would have to had to pack out the trash. When I came back Sidewinder decided that we should hike as far as we felt like going.Â  Then camp.Â  You see in Maryland you can not stealth (camp anywhere) camp.Â  But now we are in Virginia and we can. We were hopeful to make it to the Blackburn trail center. It is a AT facility with a caretaker and the Ridgerunner also stays here.Â  As we hike we say a few deer and a turkey with her babies.Â  This was really cool. Today we only passed a few hikers. Most previous hikers were doing a section hike from Harpers Ferry to Pen Mar or vice versa. There is also the tail end of thru hikers still coming north. I was trying to liven things up for Sidewinder to help her over this slump so we started doing a game naming animals starting with the letter A to Z.Â  Then other types of things etc. It made the day go faster and less boring. We finally made it to the center and even passes a set of hikers along the way.Â  About 5 minutes after we finished it started pouring. We made it just in time. We had a few hours of just lounging around. There is a big building with a screened in porch and a cabin that sleeps 4. There are 10 of us staying the night. And one more just came in now at 9:30.
It is still pouring. We are not sure what we will do tomorrow. They want 80% rain. We planned on staying put at the center but we're told one night only. I guess we will see tomorrow what happens. Hopefully the rain moved in early and we will be good to hike. The cell service is really bad here but I was able to get thru to my husband and have a good chat.

We decided if it wasn't down hill it might be worth the .4 miles each way to see it.Â  It was called the Ambassador Whitehouse trail. Well was it ever worth it. It was these beauty fields on top of the mountain.Â  It reminded me of the movie The sound of Music.

They crossed the trail and kept going down hill. The hikers said they were going to the spring at the shelter for water.Â  It was the only water in about a 6 mile proximity. There were 2 others that came thru before I woke the other hiker told me.Â  So before we could start hiking I had to walk to the spring that was a long way down the hill from the shelter.

Especially on the rocks.Â  We were clocking some miles quickly but also needed to be careful with the snow. Eventually we created a hill/ mountain and I was so hot. Mind you it was 19 degrees when we started. So off went the gloves and hat and I unzipped my coat. Well I thought it was just me but Sidewinder and Campbell were also doing the same. We eventually got to Sunrise Mountain.Â  It had this beautiful stone pavilion on top of the mountain.Â  We said they could have weddings up there.Â  You see there is a parking it close by with easy access. We found out they have had weddings there. We hiked some more then grabbed a bite to eat. Well we didnât sit too long and we started getting cold. So we broke out the hand warmers. Note to all......donât wait until the last minute to get the hand warmers out. Your hands are too cold to function and the hand warmers donât warm up quick enough. But they did work finally. It went back and forth with warm and cold all day. I feel that we were well prepared and wasnât over dressed. Our shuttle driver told us when to call him to have him come for us.Â  Also note to all.....cold is not good for your cell phones. It drains your battery.Â  Keep it close to your inside body heat. Not an outside pocket. I had 1% when it was time to call George.Â  I did have battery back up.Â  But that wasnât working well eitherÂ  George picked us up and was amazed at how quick we hiked.Â  We got back to hotel and the heat was not on in our room. We were now freezing. Our sweat was now drying and we were cold. As we waited for the room to warm up. We made hot chocolate with Fireball. Yummy.

It went pretty well.Â  As you can probably figure, the first hill we were sweating like crazy.Â  I ditched my down coat and went with my shell. We put foot warmers in our shoes and hand warmers in our mittens.Â  We were kinda bi polar with the temperature. One minute hot and one minute cold.Â  The first part of our hike wasÂ  a little slow.Â  We had to be careful. We had to rock scrambles to go down. Campbell lent us her extra pair yak tracks.

Pretty cool.Â  As we continued the trail was pretty flat and easy so we decided to hike farther than planned. As we are following the trail there are no longer any foot prints in the snow but oddly enough. Many of the wildlife were following the trail. We had fun trying to figure out what tracks were on the trail.Â  I was pretty sure we saw some bearÂ  tracks in the snow and further along down the trail my thoughts were confirmed with fresh bear tracks.Â  We could see the pad prints in the snow. We also saw turkey prints deer.Â  Pretty sure we saw fox and coyote as well.Â  Towards the end of our hike we came to lots for raised planks to walk on.Â  It was all fun and games until Sidewinder almost fell. We realized we should have ended our hike where we planned because the next 2 Miles were up and down up and down.Â  Just as Sidewinder is complaining about the hill, there is Campbell on her knees from a fall. Sidewinder said she will stop complying now. It was funny at the time. As we crested the hill and came swoop.

As we ran for breakfast before we started our hike it was 6 degrees out. Brrrrr.Â  We had our breakfast at the Mixing Bowl. It is a cute little restaurant with great food and local people who think we are just crazy. We hustled to get our stuff ready. There is a lot more to do with the extreme cold.Â  We heated our soup up.Â  Got our hand warmers started and in place along with our many layers.Â  To start today I had a base layer of cold gear, then a shirt with heat reflective.Â  Then my merino base layer.Â  Iâm not sure they were worn in the right order but oh well. Then outside I had on my shell jacket and my down jacket on top.Â  Usually after I start hiking I will through my down in my pack. Then just put it on when we stop to rest. I also had 3 layers on my bottom. Most definitely I need my chapstick in my pocket for my lips.we had a new shuttle driver named Ken who we found on the section hiker page. He was so nice to volunteer to shuttle us to the trail and the motel will pick us up. Our day of course started out with a decent climb and we were warmed up in no time.Â  We went thru a lot of wooded areas and fields.Â  I will tell you the Unionville area is not very well,marked and we found ourselves wondering often if we were on the trail. As we strolled thru the hills and valleys we came across a lot of board planks to walk on. It was fine but we had to be careful because it was slippery. Eventually we came out to the road and did a really long road walk.Â  Probably our longest so far of the 400 Miles we have done so far. We then turned off into the Wallkill National wildlife refuge. We walked on a really nice flat trail around the marsh lands of the refuge. We really didnât see much wildlife because it was so cold. As we came our of the refuge we started the climb up Pochunk mountain.Â  We stopped at the shelter for lunch. Although we were able to get out of the wind, it was still so cold that we couldnât have our gloves off for long.Â  We tried to melt the snow to get water because all the creeks were frozen solid. Our burner didnât work well.Â  Iâm not sure if it was the cold or the fuel was getting low.Â  We have decided tomorrow we will put hot water in our bottles because all our water we had on us was frozen.Â  Campbellâs hydration bladder tube was froze solid.Â  But at least we were able to share her water in the bladder.Â  We had to start hiking again. Because we were getting so cold. It finally seemed like we were at the top and then we would go back down just to climb 2 more times. One of the climbs we had a pretty good rock scramble which I wasnât expecting.Â  We had to be careful with all the rocks being snow covered. After the mountain we had a few low lying mountain trails.Â  Of course leave it to me to wipe out on an icy patch.Â  But all was good or so I thought. As we continued we finally hit the famous boardwalk area so many talk about.Â  It was a boardwalk that weaved thru the marshlands.Â  This went on about a mile. A nice break from the mountains. We were just coming out thinking we were almost there. I had put my phone inside my clothing because once again it wasnât working right in the cold.Â  I had 30% and it died again. A while later when I realized my phone wasnât where I put it.Â  I must have lost it when I wiped out. So I ran back as the others slowly followed. Just when I was ready to give up, I came across 3 men. I asked them if they saw it and they had it. I was so relieved.Â  Of course we went a mile or so backtracking out of our way. I know Sidewinder wasnât happy.Â  But all was well. We finally came to the stiles to cross into the cow pastures. We could see the road where we were going to be picked up.Â  So we called the motel.Â  They said 5 minutes. We waited and waited for them out in the cold.Â  Now I know this may sound silly after hiking 13 miles and 6.5 hours in the cold.Â  But now we were standing still and getting cold quick.

Â By now the locals know us and think we are crazy for hiking in this cold weather. Â  I think I would have to agree. Â But crazy or not we did it. Â We were dropped off by the motel owner at the 94 trail head. Â Just up the street. Â We have been told about the stairway to heaven and it was in front of our eyes. It was quiet intimidating I must say. Luckily a lot of the trail didnât go straight up. Â It did weave around and just when we thought we did the hard part, the stairs came along. Â I will say it is exhausting but at least with the steps. It is not as hard as going straight up. But we still needed our rests because it was I really intense. Finally at the top was a carin that pointed to the View. Â Thankfully we went and looked because it was beautiful. Â He rest of the Day was up and down small mountains. It wasnât terrible but it wasnât easy Â either. Â We finally stopped at half way to eat at the Wawayanda shelter otherwise know as the Wawayanda Hilton. Â Letâs just say it was a basic 3 sided shelter with a privey. Â But is was still good to sit and eat. Â We only lasted about 10min before our sweat started making us cold and our fingers were so cold. Â I would say it probably was only 14 degrees. I again was having phone trouble because of the cold. So donât just rely on Guthook because 3 times today my phone died. Eventually when it got warm it came back on. Time for a new phone I guess. Very glad Sidewinder had the AWOL guide. Also note to all if you have a shuttle lined up. Â Make sure to share the number in the cold weather in case. Â Anyway we continued up and down thru the mountains and finally came to the blue trail. Â We decided to hike past a tenth of a mile to the stage line. We did it we completed New Jersey. We then went back to the blue trail and took that down to Greenwood lake where our shuttle driver was to meet us. It was tough going dow, Â it killed my knees. At this point my phone was dead again so we couldnât let our shuttle driver know we were running behind. Â We were almost at the bottom when Ken and his dog were walkingÂ to meet us. We had 10miles in plus a mile down the blue trai. He drove us back to the motel. We had amazing showers then went to Smokeyâs in Vernon to have a meal and drinks.

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595762,Our day started with our friends Amanda and Robert picking us up at 8:30 and we they drove us 4:30 minutes to the start of the trail at Thornton Gap Virginia.Â  This is in the beginning of the Shenandoah mountains.Â  We are so grateful to have friends like them who would do this for us. We got to the park entrance and filled out our Backcountry permits.Â  We then said our good byes and we hit the trail. Of course the trail starts off with a huge mountain that we had to climb.Â  It took us 1:15 just to getÂ  to the peek. We had a great view at Maryâs Rock. We started hearing stories of a bear hanging on the trail.Â  We continued up and down and finally came to a pretty flat trail.Â  I was looking at my camera while Sidewinder was strolling along in her cool sunglasses. She canât see anything with them. Most times when we see a tree stump we think itâs a bear.Â  Well this time we thought it was a tree stump and it WAS a bear.Â  We were probably 15-20 feet from it.Â  The bear could have cared less about us as it was rooting around in a tree stump.Â  We hurried to get pictures before we pissed off the bear. It was pretty cool. Then just a little further we startled another bear who ran off the trail. Meanwhile another hiker was coming towards us videoing the bear.Â  Thank goodness he ran off the trail and didnât get trapped between us. So I was trying to explain to the hiker where the other bear was. The conversation went like this.... after the 2 bear scat the bear will be on your left. We managed to hike on to see to more nice views at Little Stony man cliffs & Stony man mountain. We werenât sure we wanted to go .3 miles off the trail but it was worth the view.Â  Besides we had less than a mile and we were done hiking.Â  After that we planned to eat at Skyland Resort.Â  It is a really nice place but hiker friendly and has a pub too. So we tucked in the woods and set up our hammocks and hung our bear bag. The went and ate. I had a really good cheese steak. It was 1200 calories.Â  I needed it after those mountains. While we were there we got to see this amazing sunset. Itâs just about 10 pm and we are cozy in our hammocks.Â  Itâs a pleasant night so we are going to try with out our flyâs tonight.Â  Hopefully the bears donât visit us tonight.,"Thornton Gap Virginia.

I am still trying to perfect my hang.Â  My underquit kept shifting and I was getting cold.Â  Not awful but noticeable. As I layed in my hammock deciding if I should get up I could see the mosquitos on the outside of the net.Â  I decided to stay put a while longer.Â  The day stated off with breakfast at sky top lodge.Â  It was an all you can eat buffet.Â  It was so good. Then we started off hiking. It was pretty uneventful all day with a few views and not too many mountains or elevation changes.Â  We eventually got to Big Meadows Wayside.Â  We have heard so much talk about there blackberry shakes we had to try one.Â  The question was, is it worth the .3 mike up hill to the wayside. At this point we had 8 miles in and needed a rest.Â  So we had our blackberry shakes and lunch. It was very busy and lost of chatter inside the wayside.Â  I almost couldnât wait to get back on the trail for some peacefulness. So this is part of why we are supporting Hike For Mental Health.

We were both doing well after another break so we started hiking again of out of nowhere there is this bear just watching us as we passed.Â  It was kinda worrisome that she watched us so closely.Â  Well just up the trail another bear who was smaller came on the trail.Â  It was so scared and scurried away. Probably the baby bear of mama watching us. We also saw a nice buck under a tree just sitting there. We had one last mountain to climb. But there was an alternate route that had a rock scramble. Â  So what do these 2 girls do that are from âRocksylvaniaâ? We do the rock scramble. It was tough but so are we.Â  We concurredÂ  it. There was only a short distance more to the Bearfence Moutain Hut. When we arrived it was full with hikers old and new.Â  I even ran intoÂ  Snow White who I met last year in PA on the trail.

It ended up it was just the owls talking back-and-forth. I did fall back asleep for a little while until I heard the morning birds chirping. With that I got up and found the privy and started my morning coffee. The night before I prepared my oatmeal with a cold soak overnight so that was waiting for me as well. With that the rest of the crew at the shelter started getting up. There was a hiking group from Washington in with the lead guy who has hiked the Triple Crown which is the PCT the continental divide and the Appalachian Trail He was young fella no more than 30 years old. They were car camping and going to a Falls so he had all his supplies with them and was generous with sharing even giving out bacon to everyone.Â  We packed up and hit the trail about nine and the day was pretty on eventful other than some small climbs.Â  They were long so it was still tiring. We have not seen much in the way of wildlife so far and we have about half a day and as I started writing this. I am sitting here with our bags as sidewinder truck the .3 mile down to the water. Weâre leery to leave our bags alone not so much for someone stealing them, because were in the middle of the woods but for the Bears to come and take them for food.Â  As the day went on we did get a glimpse of a bear.Â  We continued hiking over SaddlebackÂ  Mountain andÂ  High top mountain.Â  These 2 were piggybacked to each other and was about a 3 mile climb. It wasnât the steepest climb but with it so long and the heat of the day I was really lagging.

It was quiet hot out today which made for a hard day.Â  We climbed 4 mountains today again not all that steep but very long. On the 3rd mountain we were so annoyed. We had enough of the mountains, the gnats were so annoying and then the black flies were getting us.Â  Even though we used Sawyers Picardin which usually works well. On the last climb there was a light at the end of the tunnel.Â  We had another Wayside waiting for us. We had made it there by 4:00 The food was so good the water was so cold and the BlackBerry milk shake was just what I needed we met a few other hikers there and chatted about the days adventures. With only 1 more mile to do after the wayside we were able to enjoy our time.Â  Then her trecked to Loft Mountain campground for a shower and laundry.Â  It never felt so good to be clean. We decided to forgo the camping at the campground because the walk back and forth to the site from showers and laundry were too far apart. So we went back on the trail and tucked in the woods. We didnât see too much wildlife other than the deer that almost ran Sidewinder over. Today was again quiet grueling for me.Â  Sidewinder seems to be pulling ahead of me more often. Why is that?

Thankfully I have been sleeping with my headlamp around my neck.Â  I threw open my hammock and fly and not to far away i see 2 eyes staring at me.Â  It was pitch black so I couldnât tell for sure if it was a bear, but it certainly was at the level of a bear.Â  I yelled and it circled around and stopped.Â  I yelled and clanked my hiking poles and it moved again and stopped.Â  This time I just kept yelling and it finally scurried off.Â  I am certain it was a bear.Â  A deer would have bolted.Â  We later found out at the camp store that there has been a nuisance bear around. It was very unsettling and hard to fall back to sleep. In the Moring we grabbed coffee to go in our water bottles and eat as we hiked. The first few miles were pretty easy. We were just settling into our grove when next thing there were triplet cubs and a mama bear.Â  We hurried past as mamma watched us and her cubs as they ran up the tree. We got a few quick pictures and hurried along. Then on the other side was another bear.Â  Papa maybe?Â  We continued as the heat got worse the mountains got worse.Â  We had to go to Black Rock hut which is down a steep hill, because it will be the only water for the next 12 miles. We cold soaked our dinner and breakfast for later so that we wouldnât need so much water when we got to camp later. We passed over 4 mountains again. We both struggled but Sidewinder was having symptoms of heat exhaustion.Â  So we rested for a while and slowed down our pace, which I was thankful for. We did much better.Â  We just have to listen to our bodies. Finally we crested the last mountain and pressed on to get to Turks gap. As we were coming down the last mile of course we see another bear. We made it almost to the gap where we found a nice campsite. Hopefully our campsite is far enough away from him.Â  The only problem is all the trees are so tall without limbs to hang out food. We did find one eventually farther away so hopefully if the bear comes it will go to that.

As we continued hiking there were quite a bit of smaller climbs and rock sections.Â Â We didnât expect that when we looked at our guides.Â Â Either that or we are just out of shape.Â Â Â I think weâre out of shape since it kicked our butts.

I heard something howling in the distance and hoped that it stayed where it was.Â Â I woke up pretty early and had my coffee and breakfast in the morning breeze.Â Â My breakfast consisted of a mixture of carnation infant breakfast, protein powder, hot choc, and oatmeal. We started our hike a little before 9. Over all it wasnât a bad day. We had a small down hill then basically a 4 mile climb.Â Â Although it want too bad because it went on a slow incline and kinda wrapped back and forth up the mountain until we got to the top where the switchbacks started.Â Â Halfway up the hill we stopped at Punchbowl shelter to lol for a NOBO guidebook he left behind. No luck. But it gave us something to do. We finally had a nice view at PunchBowl overlook. It really was beautiful. We finally created the mountain and were headed for the 5 mile down hill.Â Â I was tough.Â Â We were sweating like crazy.Â Â I know down hill and tough.Â Â It just went on and on.Â Â Our feet and knees were killing us. We finally walked along the creek for quite some time but at this point I just wanted to be done. Finally we came out of the woods and met our shuttle driver from Stanimals hostel. The first thing we did was get on the WiFi.Â Â We have had bad cell service the past 2 days. We then showered did laundry and got our supplies.Â Â We noticed our friend was at the free shelter for hikes in Glasgow.Â Â We decided to go find her.Â Â When we walked in and she saw us she came running for hugs. It was so much fun catching up with her we went and had dinner together and weâre reminiscing about trail days.Â Â Â It was sad to say good bye but we told her we would see her in Pennsylvania.

We took a 45 min drive to Cornelius Creek Shelter which is .2 miles off the Blue Ridge Parkway.Â Â We headed into the woods hoping we were going in the right direction.Â Â Â Thankfully we were. We came to the shelter that was full of thru hikers and also Boy Scouts. We said hello and continued on. We had a small climb and was hoping it was the big one.Â Â Of course not.Â Â We then had our 1000 foot climb. It was work but it wasnât terrible.Â Â Â We were at Apple Orchard meadow.Â Â It was like a mountain bald.Â Â There was a weather tower at the top.Â Â It looked like the Epcot ball. As we started coming down the other side, bam, there was the Guillotine.Â Â Â It was much bigger in person than i have seen in pictures.Â Â It was a change of pace and also gave us something to make our hike not seem so dull. We finally came to Thunder hill shelter where we met up with 5 they hikers. Through out the day we were leap frogging with them.Â Â It also made the day interesting. We came to Thunder ridge overlook. It was just beautiful.Â Â We hiked on for quite a while going down hill gradually.Â Â Almost 1400 feet.Â Â It just kept going and going.Â Â At the bottom we all had lunch and continued on.Â Â We had one more climb.Â Â At this point it was very hot and the air was very stale. It was a 700 foot climb but it was steeper.Â Â We were exhausted by this time. After regroupingÂ Â we pushed on. We had another 8 miles of down hill to go.Â Â We could hear rumbling in the distance and hoped we could beat the rain.Â Â WRONG! 6 miles left and the flood gates opened up.Â Â We were running down the mountain as quickly and safely as we could until our knees couldnât take it anymore.Â Â Â Finally the rain slowed down.Â Â At this point we were drenched.Â Â 6 miles down hill is very tough.Â Â It is not physically exhausting but it is hard on the body. We finally got to the shelter and just sat for a few minutes to give our body time to rest. We had 2 more easy miles left until we got to foot bridge to cross the James River.Â Â By this time the sun was out and it was beautiful.Â Â We were finally done.Â Â We hiked 20.1 miles today. Thankfully we slackpacked because we were going back to Stanimals tonight. The only problem is, we were an hour early for our shuttle.Â Â We sat with our new they hiker friends and we put our thumbs out trying to get a hitch. It took a while but finally a truck stopped and took us all.Â Â It was very nice.Â Â We got to town as our shuttle driver was headed out to get us.Â Â I finally had cell service and could call him and he turned around and picked us up at the store to go back to the hostel.Â Â Shwew.Â Â It was a long day.","Cornelius Creek Shelter

We started off our hike with 6/10 mile climb going south. Nothing like waking up the lungs first thing in the morning.Â Â Â It was quite an exhausting day.Â Â Lots of climbs today and it was hot and humid on the mountain tops.Â Â I was just not into hiking today.Â Â I think because I was dreading the rain.Â Â If we get caught in it today then we are wet for days.Â Â We do not get anywhere near a town till Thursday. We pressed on.Â Â We finally got to a road crossing with a huge stream. We sat and had lunch and wadded in the water.Â Â It was so refreshing. After one exhausting climb we had to take a break at the top.Â Â Â Not for long because we heard rumbling.Â Â We kicked it in high gear.Â Â We were 1 mile until the shelter.Â Â Today my feet were bothering me.Â Â I think the down hill is killing my heels and the uphill is bothering my big toe joint.Â Â I manage with some duct tape on the skin to stop the rubbing. We made it to the shelter and actually had cell phone service and looked at the weather.Â Â The rain pushed off until 5:30.Â Â We decide to get 4 more miles in so we could stay on our schedule. One more big climb.Â Â The only good thing about this one is that Sidewinder could pick blueberries as we climbed the mountain. We only saw one deer today and it wasnât scared of us at all.Â Â We also saw a few Lizards and snails.Â Â We finally made it to Bearwallow gap. We also beat the rain.Â Â We hurried and got water and set up our hammocks because the rain was coming.Â Â We just finished and started cooking when the rain started. We huddled in our hammocks and ate dinner.Â Â I tried to hang our food so the bears donât get it. But once again they are all tall trees.Â Â Maybe a bear canister is needed.Â Â Well itâs quite early but not much to do since it is raining and no cell service.Â Â So I guess I will try to go to sleep.Â Â 7 pm.Â Â Thatâs a first for me","Cornelius creek shelter

Our day started off with a climb out of bearwallow gap.Â Â  Â Â After that we came to a view at Peaks of otter over look.Â Â We were in the clouds.Â Â Â It was such a view.Â Â The trail continued on for many miles with views and overlooks.Â Â We saw a small snake and some newts.Â Â Over all the trail was pretty easy. We passed 2 shelters today.Â Â The first we stopped for water. The second we decided to stop and eat and to decide if we should stay there or continue.Â Â Â The storms were brewing so it was a calculated risk. We want to stay on target and we could get to another shelter so we pushed on.Â Â The only thing it meant instead of the easy day it turned into a hard day.Â Â We had a step 1000 foot climb followed by a steep 500 foot climb. As we started the first one the storm kicked in.Â Â At first the cold rain was refreshing but in rained harder and we decided to get our rain gear out.Â Â I am glad we did I was getting cold.Â Â Eventually it diminished and the sun peeked out as we did our last climb to the shelter.Â Â Well what do you know but there was a Boy Scout group there.Â Â Great.Â Â No really they were well behaved and quiet very early.Â Â Today my feet are getting sore.

It was nice to compare stories and to see where everyone was from. Then one of the hiker food bags was stuck in the trees.Â Â The knot he used was so tight on the PCT hang that we couldnât release it. Finally after 2 of us helping he got it down.Â Â Â Sidewinder and I packed up our stuff and hit theÂ Â trail because today is the day we were meeting our friends Silver fox at the Troutville exit. The hike was mostly downhill but it was very wet from the rain the day before and kind of walking on the side of the mountain going down so we had to be very careful not to slip or fall.Â Â It took us a while to get down the mountain. It was a nice relief to see our friend waiting at the trail for us. She took us back to the hotel where we were able to get cleaned up a little bit.Â Â We ran to McDonaldâs before we parked her car at the hotel. We now needed to walk the mile to the trail head. As we started walking we saw a truck leaving Cracker Barrel and we politely asked for a hitch to the trail head. He was more than willing to give us a ride.Â Â Todayâs hike was pretty strenuous and exhausting for all of us. We continued on because we wanted to get to tinkers cliffs to see the sunset. At one point we all needed to pee.Â Â Â Of course just when I squat a male hiker comes by.Â Â We could walk for miles without seeing a hiker but of course as soon as I need to pee, there he is. I scrambled to get my shorts up as we all had a good laugh.Â Â Sometimes we need this to change the dulldrum of the strenuous hike.Â Â Yes and even sometimes boring.Â Â As we hiked on there was a Shelter 2 miles before Tinkers cliffs. We stopped there for water. It was supposed to rain today pretty heavily but thankfully it never did.Â Â So we continued the hard climb up the cliffs. The view was breathtaking and well worth the climb.Â Â Shortly after the sunset we set up camp and quickly cooked before it got dark.

Hikes are not supposed to camp up there in the state park. Last night we got there right at sunset.Â Â It was beautiful.Â Â It was kinda late to push on so we set up camp there. We had hiked enough.Â Â So this morning I had set my alarm set for 5:30 to catch the sunrise. Well the night did not go as planned. The winds kicked in so bad that it was howling all night.Â Â My hammock was rocking back and forth and I was cold from the wind blowing so much. Bad idea to sleep up there. The even worse I was hoping to see a beautiful sunrise. I sat out on the cliffs wrapped in my underquilt watching for the sun to come up.Â Â O sun to be seen.Â Â Even worse it looked like storm clouds rolling in. I did get a few pics of clouds etc but no sunrise. So we started packing up with hopes to be on the trail at 8am and also hoping not to get caught camping at the cliffs. As we were gathering g our stuff 5 deer wandered In really close to us.Â Â That was pretty neat. Then we look out at the cliffs and there is a rainbow. It was beautiful.Â Â A once in a lifetime moment.Â Â Â We finally hit the trail and hiked swims tough miles until we got to McAfee knob.Â Â The last half mile was exhausting. We got to the top and took a few pictures and along cake the trail maintainer. After talking to him we found out that the knob was just up a bit more.Â Â Oh my gosh it was huge. I have visually dreamed of this place and we were finally here. We took our turns getting pictures along with the rest of the crowd.Â Â I did find it rude that2 women sat in the background where they were clearly in everyoneâs pictures. They were oblivious. Oh well. After the knob we still had alit of hiking to do.Â Â Again some hard climbs for all of us. We met up with Patriot68 a 71 year old southbounder. We couldnât even keep up with him. We finally came out to the road where 4 Pines hostel was.Â Â Luckily a women was dropping off hikers and gave us a ride.Â Â Our 3rd hitch this hike. We literally dropped our gear and they shuttled us to an all you can eat dinner buffet called Homeplace.Â Â It was as really good. Then finally got back and Silverfox showered while I started laundry. There is no dryer so we have all our clothes hanging on our bunks to dry. There is 1 shower for about 15 hikers.Â Â So Sidewinder had to wait a while.Â Â 10 pm was lights out.Â Â Â So now I lay in my top bunk Sidewinder beside me and silverfox below her.Â Â Meanwhile 2 hikers are snoring away.Â Â Guess there wonât be much sleep tonight either.,"Tinker Cliffs

With the intense day of Dragons tooth ahead of us we planned on a shorter day.Â Â We made friends with Patriot68(a 71 year old gentleman), Fox Feet and Fairweather yesterday. We all decided to slackpack Dragons tooth. We split the $20 shuttle fee to drive us to our starting point.Â Â Patriot68 lead the way as Sidewinder and I followed the others following behind us. Overall the climb was not too bad.Â Â We had a lot of switchbacks which made it a pretty easy climb. As we neared the top we would climb some pretty good rock sections.Â Â Each time we would get to the top we thought we were there. But then it flattened out until we got to another rock section.Â Â By this time 3 of us lead and the other 3 were behind just a bit.Â Â When we would get to a hard section or a section where they may miss a turn we would wait for them. Eventually I got to a blue blaze for Dragons tooth. I waited for the others to catch up and we finally arrived at this huge mass of rocks.Â Â You didnât have to climb to the top but since we got this far we had to try. I got almost to the top.Â Â I was afraid if I went any further I would not be able to get back down.Â Â We sat and had lunch then took the long rock scramble down the trail.Â Â It was quite precarious at some spots.Â Â Just when we thought we were off the rocks we came to another rock section. We joked this was the dragons tail.Â Â Then more rocks.Â Â By now my knees are aching from all the down hill.Â Â We eventually hit a bunch of switchbacks leading us to the road.Â Â We had a 1/4 mile walk to the hostel.Â Â I was so glad to be gone this day.Â Â It was amazing but I think it also was one of the toughest days.Â Â Sidewinder held up well on the down hills especially with the knee issue she is having.

By this time three of us were ready to puke. What a way to start our 4 mile climb to the top of the Audi Murphy memorial. Although the climb was not one of the worst we had this section it was very long but luckily it was not the steepest. At this point we all had our trail legs and weâre doing really well. Patriot68 was waiting at the top for us and we all sat down and had a snack. Eventually Foxfeet and Fairweather caught up to us. They seem to like to take a slower pace than we do.Â Â At this point we had the long downhill to get to the road where our friend Dee would be picking us up. We picked this location because it was the only road crossing that was convenient for all of us. The hike became fun because all we did was pick blueberries for Sidewinder to eat.Â Â I also think we were a little bit perkier knowing that today was our last day and the torture was over. We have all taken a toll on our bodies from this hike. Sidewinder thinks she has a torn meniscus, I have two blisters and my knees are aching, and Silver foxâs hip started acting up today. We got down to the bottom of the trail 15 minutes earlier than we thought. As we waited for her friend Dee the time seemed to take by which we thought was a little odd because sheâs always a little early. Upon trying to call her and text her her phone went right to voicemail. This was a little concerning for us so we tried to get a hold of her family. Now all weâre thinking is how the heck are we going to get out of here with no ride and where the heck is Dee. I stop the car coming down the road to see if they saw her. No luck. Just then Sidewinder was able to get through to Dee andÂ Â she had trouble finding the exact location. She needed to find cell phone service but she was around the corner from us. We now could go for lunch and get Silver Fox back to her car and drive the 5.5 hours home. We completed 126.2 miles in 9 days.

Mountain Pass Rd. I had arranged a shuttle from a great friend name Donna who lives in that area and shuttled us to our starting point at Elk Pen gap. Our plan was to hike 12.7 miles. and try and catch up to our friends silver fox and her son who had started the day before but weâre doing lower miles, and we would end at the same location this evening. Our Day quickly started with a nice climb out of the gap along with some rock sections. Eventually we came to a mountaintop that was pretty flat and enjoyable and before we knew it Bam we were at the lemon squeezer. I wasnât quite sure what to expect but it was much more narrow than I anticipated. I watch my friend Todd try to get through with this pack on and there was no way he was getting through. My pack was a bit smaller so I decided to give it a shot and had no problem although it was interesting trying to finagle through. Chuck managed to get through and then Todd handed his pack up to us and would led his way through as well.Â Â Iâve never heard that thereâs a rock climb right after the lemon squeezer but there it was. We were trying to decide if we should take the easy trail around or go up over the scramble. My thought was we had to at least try it. So off I went up over the rock scramble carefully placing my feet and hands and had no problem. The guys with their heavier packs handed their packs up and then made their way up through.Â Â I sure am glad we tried it. We continued on to the fingerboard Shelter. Where we took a little break. Unfortunately there was no water at the shelter. But as we carried on we soon came to the water towers where there was a nice stash of water.Â Â Â We continued hiking and trying to catch up with our friend. Later we realized we totally missed Tiorati circle where we couldâve got snacks and drinks. We then found a nice flat rock and sat and had her lunch. Chuck and I both packed tortillas with tuna and some snacks. Todd only had one of the goo electrolyte packets. When I asked him he said he wasnât hungry. We hiked on and eventually got to the William Brien shelter where we found silver fox and her son getting ready to head out to hike.Â Â Again no water at the shelter. Water has been very scarce on this section most of the creeks being dry. From there we hiked together. Eventually we passed over Palisades Parkway which we have always heard horror stories of the high traffic. Luckily it was a Saturday for us and although the traffic was heavy it was no problem to cross. We eventually carried on and got to a creek which was flowing well and all took on extra water because the next shelter also had no water.Â Â We had one more big climb which was tough. Part way through Todd was having difficulty and I realized that he was not drinking or eating enough to fuel his body. We got a power bar and some electrolytes in him and continues. Later he told what a difference they made.Â Â People donât realize ho many calorie they are burning on a hike like this.Â Â We took the half mile side trail to West Mountain Shelter which overlooked the Hudson River and New YorkÂ Â City.Â Â Â I set up my hammock and sat on the rock overlooking the River.

I still had a jacketÂ Â I couldÂ Â put on but as long as I stayed under my underquilt I was fine. I finally woke at 6 am from the sun shining.Â Â Thank goodnessÂ Â Â I made my coffee and read the log book.Â Â It was fun to see names of previous people I shuttled.Â Â Â Since sidewinder was still sleeping I decided to clean up the shelter. There was ramen all over and lots of trash.Â Â I swept all the trash together and swept the floor.Â Â I didnât want to touch the trash because of the Covid virus.Â 
We parked up and started our Hike. It was easy day with not too much elevation changes.Â Â We had woods, swamps, plank boards,cow pastures and even a boardwalk section.Â Â Then The fueling part started. We had 2 climbs the second one was a struggle. I wish I was a little younger doing these climbs.Â Â But we did it.Â Â We then walked along Nuclear lake which was pretty. Finally arriving at our car.Â Â Then we were going to meet our friend Donna at South Mountain pass road to be shuttled to another section to hike. She informed us that the parking was closed.Â Â What to do, what to do. So we flipped our hike and parked at the bigger lot.Â Â We stopped for pizza with Donna before she dropped us off for our next leg of your hike.Â Â Again I am snug in my hammock listening to an owl hoot.

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628229,I woke up this morning to the sound of rain again. I looked at the radar and it show no rain. The weather channel show 5%. Just our luck. So I went back to sleep for a little longer than normal. Eventually got up and got our food that we hung so the bear couldnât get it. Then set my hammock tarp up into porch mode. That way I could cook my food and make my coffee and still stay dry. I was able to just relax drinking my coffee untilÂ Â it was time to get SidewinderÂ Â moving. We had a little over 12 miles today and we want to get it done because we have aÂ Â 3 Hour drive home as well. The day started out not too bad. The rain has stopped and the hiking was fairly easy. I did have two pretty good climbs today maybe three but overall they werenât too bad. We eventually got to the hill top shrine on top of the mountain which was a nice place to sit and take a break. But then we pushed on to try and get our day done.Â Â We saw quite a few day hikers again today and a couple people that were doing some overnights. A lot of people stopped and put their masks on when they got to us because of the Covid.Â Â By the end of the day Sidewinder and I were both Sore. Sidewinders feet were really bad and I was just running out of steam. I think the three days back to back was just getting to me. I finally had our last climb and meander through the top of the mountain and then gentle long downhill until we got to our car. I have to say this hike was the most aromatic hike. Â The honeysuckle were in full bloom. Â It smelled so good.Â Yippee we were done 38.2 miles in the books,"South Mount Pass Road

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642018,"Our hike started by traveling 4 hours to Massachusetts where we met out shuttle driver/friend Susan.Â Â I previously shuttled her in PA.Â Â She shuttled a us about an hour south to Kent Connecticut where we would start our hike north back to our car.Â 
Â Â  Â  Â  Â Â We said goodbye to Susan and headed straight up the hill.Â Â What a way to start.Â Â We paced ourselves and continued on.Â Â As we were hiking something scrambled off the trail.Â Â To our surprise it was a bobcat.Â Â Â It was staring straight at Sidewinder(Kara).Â Â Â She froze.Â  Â Â I said take a picture.( she is always in the lead)Â  Â Â I eventually was able to get a video as it just slowly meandered away.Â Â So that was pretty exciting.Â Â Â We the came to St Johnâs Ledges. Thatâs exactly what is was.Â Â This huge rock ledge we had to scramble down.Â Â It was quite technical.Â Â Then we had literally a 5 mile walk along a river.Â Â Although the walk was not bad we were bombarded by gnats and mosquitoes.Â Â Â There literally was a swarm following us.Â Â We tried to keep a quick pace to get away from them and to make up some time we lost earlier in the day.Â Â Our last part of our hike was another grueling climb.Â Â Â It was steep and just seemed to never end.Â Â Finally at the bottom we had the owner of Coltsfoot valley farm pick us and other hikers up.Â Â We went back to his farm where we had a bed, shower and a fresh vegetable and pasta dinner and also cheese that he made on the farm.Â  Â Â It was a perfect way to end the day. We were so tired and didnât expect to get dinner too.Â Â It was a full house with 6 hikers and the host.","Route 341

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642017,"Woke up early to enjoy my coffee. The house was quiet while I set up my camp stove. Spirit a man who camped in his tent joined me and we chatted.Â Â We had done the PCT and 3/4 of the way done the AT.Â Â Eventually everyone was ready and we made a quick stop at the market for a coffee for everyone.Â Â We then got dropped off and headed down the side of the mountain where we had to ford across the river.Â  Â Â I chose to take me trail runners off and put my crocks on.Â Â While Sidewinder decided to chance it and go across.Â Â She tiptoed across the rocks even with her coffee in had.Â Â Not me.Â Â I guzzled mine.Â Â Of course after that there was another good climb.Â Â I question my self if I am getting too old for this or what.Â Â Maybe I should have trained more.Â Â 
Â Â  Â  Â Â We passed several hikers the past 2 days.Â Â Some section hikers some southbounders or SOBOâs and we leapfrogged with several hikers going NOBO.Â Â Today was a slightly boring hike with the only interesting thing beingÂ Â Rogers Ramp.Â Â It was a small narrow passage between rocks that we had to squeeze thru.Â Â The mosquitoes again were terrible.Â Â We stopped at the shelter for a rest and water.Â Â Water is really prevalent in CT. This is helpful so we donât have to carry so much water.Â Â We also saw lots of tiny toads while hiking today.Â Â About 3 miles from our destination we came to Hang glider view.Â Â Â As we sat and had a snack we could look out over Lime Rock Speedway. It was neat to see the cars racing from afar.Â Â We had one more climb to do.Â Â The last one always gets me.Â Â But finally we made it to the campsite around 5:30. We set up with 2 other hikers and chatted while we cooked and ate dinner.Â Â They are 2 friends from 8th grade who now are they hiking. I am happy to now be in my hammock relaxing. Itâa only 8:30 so I hope not to go to sleep too early or I will be awake at 3am.Â Â Stay tuned","Ct route 4

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642068,I had the most restless night on the trail. First of all hikers came into our camp in the dark shining their lights all sound and talking loudly. Â The finally leave and set up on the hill. Â The were up talking loudly till after midnight. Â  Then I finally fall asleep and wake up again and take a sleeping pill. Â I sleep for 3 hours and then am wide awake. Finally get up around 6:30.Â Enjoyed my coffee peacefully. Â We stayed with 4 other hikers who we would leap frog with all day. Â We were all excited to get moving this morning because Mountain side cafe was .2 miles off trail. Our limit is .3 for blue blazing. Â We moved thru the trail pretty swiftly. Â  It was mostly down hill. Â  We also had some road walking and a short side trail to the cafe. Â The food was amazing. I had a goat cheese omelet with pesto and tomato. Â Side wonder and I also shared streusel French roast with apple compote. Â It was amazing. Â We left there and hiked along theÂ Housatonic river. Itâs a huge river. This river is the most unused river. Â  For 3 days we have crossed paths with this riverÂ and have not seen a single person fishing or kayaking.Â Â  We weaved in and out the trail along the river. Â Eventually we get to Falls Village. Itâs a cute little town. Â I would love to go back again some day. We finally come to these rock slabs in the water with a falls behind it where our hiker friends were enjoying the water. At this point we were so hot we jumped right in too. Â It was so refreshing. We then continued on our hike. We had to climb Mt Prospect. Â It was no picnic.. Â All my muscles in my legs are so sore already. Â It hurt with every step. But slowly we continued. Â The mosquitoes were nasty again today.Â We continued with one more small climb. Â  Then some crazy switchbacks to get down to the road. The trail followed the road half way into Salisbury. We veered off and walked to Mariaâs house. Â She is a trail angel who is 92 and has been taking in hikers for 20 years. Â She was very happy to see us. Â We have a bedroom with 2 twin beds to share. Â Maria does not have a washing machine and the laundry was 2 miles away. Â  So we chose to hand wash our clothes and hang them. Â They really needed it. There are 2 other gentleman in there 60âs who are here. Â They are thru hiking. Sidewinder and I went to this great pizza shop and got the best Italian meal and a glass of wine. We spent some time just relaxing and Â giving our legs a break. Â We have a hard day tomorrow. Â Â Today also was the day that I celebrated 800 miles on the trail.Â I was pretty happy about that.,"Belterâs campsite

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642107,"I woke up early and enjoyed coffee with the rest of the hikers. We talked about our plans for the day. Sidewinder and I were not in a big hurry today because we had plenty of time to do our miles.Â Â It also was going to be a bit cooler today too. We said our good byes to Maria.Â Â She was a neat lady. She really loves having hikers. We started our road walk back to the trail. Then a gentle walk thru the woods and then we began our climb up Lions head mountain.Â Â It is described as a short but difficult climb.Â Â It was an exactly that.Â Â It sure did stretch the sore muscles.Â Â Along this stretch we saw a flock of turkeys and a doe.Â Â We then meandered thru the woods slowly climbing the mountain. We then finally climbed the peak of Bear Mountain. It was rather steep at the top with a huge rock carin that was built in 1885 on top you could see all around.Â Â Â Bear mountain is the highest peak in Connecticut.Â Â We began our decent down Bear mountain.Â Â It was tough.Â Â Â Lots of rocks kinda like a rock scramble to go downÂ Â and lots of slabs of rocks. It was pretty tricky.Â Â Eventually we climbed down along Sages ravine. We walked all along the flowing stream with deep pools of water.Â Â We took our shoes off and soaked our aching feet. It felt glorious.Â Â But we couldnât get too comfortable we still had one more mountain to climb.Â Â Mt Race was before us.Â Â In the beginning we had some hard climbing and then it turned into climbing on these rock slabs surrounded by small pineÂ Â trees and blueberry bushes.Â Â The blueberries were delicious.Â Â We leapfrogged with several hikers thruÂ Â this section.Â Â Eventually we came out to a summit.Â  Â Â It was beautiful.Â Â I thought we were done.Â Â But oh no.Â Â We now had .6 miles of rock ledges to walk on overlooking the mountain.Â Â It wasnât that hard but you were on the edge and also on an incline. Finally we crested and started down the other side.Â Â We had a mile to go to get to our campsite.Â Â It was a basic campsite but has a bear box and a privy and most importantly water.Â Â We have another huge climb tomorrow.Â Â I also miscalculated because of bad internet calculations and completed my 800 miles on Saturday not yesterday.Â Â As I sit here writing this at 8:30 at night a few more hikers joined us to camp.Â Â Not sure who they are,maybe we will find out tomorrow. There is also the strangest noise in the trees. It must be some type of bird.Â Â Never heard it before.","US route 44

Yardsale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642170,"I had the worst nights sleep ever.Â Â I was so restless all night.Â Â I really donât know why.Â Â I even took 2 sleeping pills because I wanted to get a good nights sleep. On top of that these dang bird in the trees were making noise all night long. I think I finally slept from 3 to 7 am.Â Â We got a slow start hitting the trail at almost at 10 am.Â Â I think Sidewinder needed to let her feet rest.Â Â We finished down the rest of the mountain only to start up Mt Everett. It is considered a grueling climb compared to the Whites in New Hampshire. It first started with rock scrambles then turned into sheets of rock.Â Â Â We had to be careful with every step.Â Â One wrong step and we were in for trouble. On top of this some of the rocks were wet from the humidity. This took us much longer as we continued up the mountain.Â Â We finally reach the top with just about no view.Â Â Â All that work and no view. Well going down was just about the same thing.Â Â Â Only this time going down felt like we had more ups than downâs. Ironically today I felt the best I have the whole hike. Â  My muscles werenât sore and I was less fatigued. Â  Eventually we made it to the bottom where our car awaited.Â Â Â We couldnât wait to get there and change our sweaty stinky clothes.Â Â Well there were 4 people there so we loaded up and started for home. In like true hiker fashion we stopped at the first mini mart and gorged on food and drinks.Â Â It was soooooo good.Â 


In this section home we completed 49.2 miles, finished another state and completed a total ofÂ Â 800 + miles.","Raceback campsite
