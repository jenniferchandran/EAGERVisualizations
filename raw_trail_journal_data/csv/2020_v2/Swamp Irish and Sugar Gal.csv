Swamp Irish and Sugar Gal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626656,"To help us prepare for the adventure of a lifetime, hiking the Appalachian Trail, our mornings begin on top of the Mississippi River levee without fail.  Hot or cold, rain or shine, we chat and giggle as we hike the levee with its ups and downs.  We began hiking in casual clothes and have graduated to hiking attire.  Over the past few months we added to our gear until we now carry a full pack, complete with food, shelter, and clothing.  Sugar Gal’s idea of exercise is 10 minutes or mist (sweat!) whichever comes first, and Swamp Irish replies “Suck it up and get moving.”  So we glance outside to check the weather, dress accordingly, grab our packs, head to Houmas House Plantation, hike the levee, drink a bottle of water, eat a Clif Bar, and climb the Ascension Community Theater fire escape as the excitement of the Appalachian Trail adventure draws near!",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Mon",0
Swamp Irish and Sugar Gal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626657,"After our daily hikes with our packs, we are feeling kind of cocky like we can conquer the world!  We decided to hike in the Tickfaw State Park and stay over in our fancy new home, our tent! Oh Yes! We will be the envy of all the thru hikers with our spacious mansion.  Once it was setup… we scratched our heads trying to figure out how the sleeping gear would fit.  We tried this way & that way and hmmm.  We looked on the tent instructions only to discover to our dismay that it was not designed for 2 people, but for 3.  We giggled as we discussed making bunk beds but neither of us wanted to be on the bottom.  We squashed & we shoved & finally fit only the pads & bags.  Guess the backpacks will remain outside in the cool 35°F.  Our gear held up to the test.  We drifted to sleep to the sounds of the night owls as we nestled into our warm, comfy surroundings. 
We used everything we brought and had nothing to discard into the ‘Hiker Box’!  We were ready for the real test… the ‘Tank Shakedown’!  He taught us everything we know & can answer any concern we have.  With great excitement, we welcomed him into our home.  As he opened our packs, we giggled & chatted with excitement.  It was not long before Tank paused, gave us ‘The Look’, and asked the question, “What are you going to use this for?”  We glanced at each other and replied without hesitation, “Throw it in the Hiker Box!”  The giggling continued.

All of our treasures are repacked in our backpacks in their proper places, clamps are secured, straps are tightened, and away we go!  Don’t tell Tank… I grabbed something out of the Hiker Box and hid it at the bottom of my pack.  Shhhh!",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Tue",0
Swamp Irish and Sugar Gal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626747,"We passed the majestic Houmas House Plantation after our last hike to prepare for the Appalachian Trail today.  We became a little emotional, so we held hands and giggled with tears in our eyes.In preparing for our departure, we not only packed and hiked, we also spent precious time with our family and friends.  We shared meals and laughter, hugs and kisses.We are truly grateful and thank all who supported and helped us prepare for our upcoming journey. It is now time to board a train that will carry us to Atlanta, Georgia, take a shuttle to Amicalola Falls, and begin our adventurous journey on the Appalachian Trail.  The excitement of what’s to come makes us giddy!",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Sun",0

Today's miles- 0
After a peaceful Amtrak train ride to Atlanta, we met up with our shuttle driver Ron Brown, who gave us last minute tips of the trail on our way to the Amicalola Falls Lodge. He also awarded us with our first piece of trail magic, a whistle for bear encounters…. BEAR ENCOUNTERS?!?!

 

Even though we had time zone and daylight savings time changes, we woke up bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready to begin our trek of the Approach Trail. It was a perfect day to begin our hike — cloudy, with temperatures that would remain in the mid 50s for the next 24 hours. 
 

Upon arriving at the Amicalola Falls Visitor Center, we registered as thru-hikers, received our blue Appalachian Trail (AT) thru-hiker tags #874 & #875, attended the orientation, giggled as we took our picture at the Appalachian Approach Trail Arch, and began the trail. 
 

The Approach Trail begins as a casual stroll down a pathway leading to the falls stairway, which quickly changed our pace to a screeching halt. We chatted with fellow hikers, giggling as we paused to take a breath on the stairway platforms. We allowed hikers to whiz around us, wishing them well and acting as if we were being courteous, when in reality, we were taking a break!

 

It was a “kiss the ground” moment when we reached the top of Amicalola Falls! Everyone was giggling at that time because they had reached the summit of the falls – though we confess that we were all rethinking our pre-hike training, attire, and pack weight as the giggles continued. 
 

Until we noticed a precious treasure lying on the ground. The giggles faded as we wondered what it could be? 
 

Oh, no, a fellow hiker’s tent poles! The nearest hiker reached to the ground to pick them up, another hiker remarked we must find them before nightfall, and we all immediately began hiking the trail to try to catch up with the owner. Break time was over as adrenaline flowed through our tired bodies to come to the aid of a fellow hiker.

 

Ahh, yes, now the fun begins! The trail was everything we had expected and trained for. The rocky trail gave new meaning to “What goes up must come back down,” and in our case, “What goes down must go back up.” Our trekking poles were a lifesaver! We were once told that your body will tell you how to use them… and it did. 
 

The scenery was beautiful! The beaten pathway which lay before us was lined with barren trees, rocks of all shapes and sizes, and the next little mountain (or what looks like mountains when you are from Louisiana). Suddenly out of the blue, we discovered a picturesque scenic valley. Nature furnished the pathway with charming chairs of rocks to lounge upon – the perfect place to have lunch, which consisted of peanut butter wraps, tuna wraps, and cheese puffs. No lunch would be complete without a smashed blueberry muffin from breakfast. Yummy! 
 

Let’s continue our hike, shall we? The steep pathway crossed gentle flowing streams, sparkling rocks of silver, and trees marked with blue hashes to guide our way. We hiked, we drank water, we hiked, we ate protein bars, we hiked, we sat upon strategically placed rocks, we hiked, and we huffed and puffed until we could huff and puff no more. 
 

Upon reaching a sign showing the way to Springer Mountain, we noticed on a rock a black bag containing a water filtration system. No, this was not trail magic for us to treasure; a hiker ahead of us had forgotten to pick it up. We trekked on, hoping to find the hiker who would be desperately needing their treasure. 
 

Along the way we met up with a fellow hiker who brought us news that Springer Mountain Shelter was to full capacity, and it was about a mile later that we saw a light at the end of the tunnel… a sign for Black Gap Shelter. 
 

We set up camp near the shelter for the evening, prepared a gourmet supper of chicken and noodles, filled our water bottles for the next day’s trek, and found the hiker who had mislaid her filtration system. She was delighted that we had found her missing treasure. Hugs and giggles were exchanged.

 

Everyone was delighted to see fellow hikers arriving into camp that evening, and we greeted each other with waves and smiles, and enjoyed chatting about our day’s adventures.

 

There is that moment in time, when you realize that life has magically touched your heart. Today was filled with such moments.

 

What happened to the hiker who misplaced their tent poles, you ask? That’s an answer for another day….for tonight we are too tired to do anything but rest.","Amicalola Falls, Georgia

Today's Miles 4.8
We woke up to raindrops tapping on the tent’s roof top about 5:30, just like the AT Weather app had forecasted. We had an extremely restful night, which could be due to the fact that we survived the Approach Trail trek the day before. At the same time we both said 'Rain', giggled, rolled over, and waited for the rain to slow. About 7:30 the rain stopped, we broke camp, and were out on the trail by 8 am. The temperatures remained in the mid 50’s the entire day and night. 
The major decision of the morning lay before us was where do we enjoy breakfast?  Springer Mountain Shelter sounds like a winner! A drizzling, misty rain kept us refreshed during our trek toward the shelter. 
Before reaching the shelter we stumbled upon the Appalachian National Scenic Trail Southern Terminus Plaque. This moment took us by surprise and we chatted with a fellow hiker who went by the name of Darwin. Hikers continued to arrive, sharing stories of their past hikes and pictures to forever capture this precious moment in time, and registered in the hiking book beneath the plaque. With smiles on our faces, we giggled with excitement as we continued our trek to Springer Mountain Shelter where we enjoyed breakfast with Janie, a fellow hiker.
Today’s hike will include looking for white blaze marks on the trees, intermittent gentle rain showers, little mud puddles between rocks, misty forests that look like something from an eerie movie, footbridges and trickling streams. All this put our trekking poles to the test as we weathered the new terrain and trekked toward Stover Creek Shelter.","Black Gap Shelter

Hummm! I think we may have taken the wrong turn somewhere along the way because there are no white blaze marks on the majestic, moss hung, oak trees or the towering magnolia trees. The babbling mountain stream, now looks like a quiet, murky bayou. And the tallest mountain we can find resembles the Mississippi River levee.
 
Oh well, now is the perfect time to take advantage of gathering hugs and kiss from the kids, grandkids, family, and friends. They giggle while listening to our adventures, and we enjoy crawfish pie.
 
Our awesome medical support team is sending us back to enjoy our walk in the woods. Their faces reflect joy and excitement because they have accomplished a job well done, returning us to our amazing journey.

Life’s Sweet Journey is calling...

‘What did you say?

What did you say?’

‘...go back to the Appalachian Trail!!!’

 

After being snatched from the trail due to COVID-19, it is time to return to our adventures on the Appalachian Trail. This time, we will not begin in Georgia for a northbound hike. Instead, our sweet journey will begin in Maryland going north as a flip flopper; heading to Katahdin, Maine; then back to Maryland near Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia; and ending in Georgia.

 

We’ve hiked the levee of the Mississippi River in Louisiana for the past few months. The hikes started at Houmas House Plantation, continued to Bocage Plantation, then to Impala-Burnside Terminal, and back to Houmas House Plantation. These morning treks were filled with smells of sweet magnolias, eagles in flight, ships cruising down the river, and the gentle southern breeze sweeping over the levee.

 

We giggle with excitement, anticipating new sights, smelling new scents, and hearing new sounds of the great outdoors as we enjoy the pleasures the Appalachian Trail.",,View Entry,"Jul 13, Mon",0

The Appalachian Trail has called our hearts back to the trail!

 

Mike, our son, walked 10 feet on the trail, so he could say he had hiked the Appalachian Trail! LOL! He gave us hugs and kisses from the whole family, then off to home sweet home he went! Sadness filled our hearts to see him go, but was quickly replaced with giggles as we trekked up and down the rocky hills.

 

The weather is perfect for hiking, with forecasts in the 70s during the day and 60s at night. Ok, enough of the weather report...it was HOT as Blazes while we huffed and puffed on today’s trek!!!

 

Fellow trail hikers were few and far between. When we encountered others, it was the perfect time to take a break! All stopped to chat about what they had experienced and shared valuable knowledge of the trail ahead... mostly water sources.

 

The day was filled with beautiful scenery, wildflowers, birds singing, wildlife of all sizes, and rolling hills. The trail graced us with red berries, resembling raspberries,  that tickled our taste buds. A fellow hiker educated us on the proper name, Wineberries! They did make us giggle!!!

 

For lunch, we dined on peanut butter wraps and Cheetos at Ed Garvey Shelter while chatting with ‘Little Tripper.’ She enlightened us that we could have started at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia because the train track pedestrian walkway opened a couple of days earlier.

 

Today’s hike was a pleasant one! After feasting on chicken flavored chicken noodles and watching hundreds of lightening bugs (fire flies) fill the air around us, our day has come to a close. We drift off to sleep in our cozy tent at Crampton Gap Shelter (mile marker 1036.5).","Weverton Cliffs Parking Lot, Maryland

Swamp Irish and Sugar Gal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629471,"Day 2It did not matter what filled our day or who we encountered...tonight we would have a shower at Dahlgren Backpackers Campground! As we hiked, we sang the shower song and giggled!!

 

What goes up must come down...and down they did…rocks, rocks, and more rocks as we hiked on steep terrain! Do you have water? Did you drink it all? Did you not save me a few drops?!?! Don’t worry, there’s a spring at mile marker 1039.1 — only 0.5 mile East (according to the AT Guide). Let me enlighten you on a tiny fact...on the AT, 0.5E is like Mouse’s Wide Ride: straight down, on rocks, around sharp curves, and going 237 miles per hour for 30 minutes! Here comes the good part...the water source was just a tiny trickle!! If that’s not enough, we huffed & puffed our way back up to the top of the Mountain…another 50 minutes! The sad news is, all we could do was giggle because we drank half of our water from the tiny trickle spring on the way back up!!! 
 

After that adventure, we discovered a wonderful spring with easy access a couple miles up the trail at Rocky Run Shelter. Life is Sweet! Have no fear, we stumbled upon a blueberry patch that made all our troubles (and memories of the rocky hike for a trickle of water) disappear! We giggled some more and enjoyed blueberries until our tongues turned blue! Yummy!!

 

Dahlgren Backpackers Campground appeared on the trail out of the blue, complete with toilets, showers, water, and last but not least, an outlet in the restrooms to recharge our electronics (as valuable as a shower). After supper and a shower, we talked with Caveman & Snail. They assured us we would have our trail legs soon. We drifted off to sleep to the sounds of owls chatting in the distance and visions of fire flies lighting the sky around us like sparkling stars!

Shortly after we left Dahlgren, we encountered a fellow hiker stealth camping, sleeping in a hammock (a first for us).
The day was filled with up and down terrain that had us hopping over rocky ground. No more giggling!
Those delicious red berries, found since we started, were strategically placed along the trail for our dinning pleasure. A fellow hiker informed us that they were called Wedding Berries. Hummm! Wineberries…Wedding Berries…now we have 2 names for the yummy red berries.
Another hiker, wearing a kilt (another first), let us know the water source at Pine Knob Shelter was dry. The same gentleman told us we would not find rocks until we were in Pennsylvania. However, by the time we arrived the spring flowed forth with ice cold, clear water. We giggled, filtered our water, filled all bottles, enjoyed our delicious lunch of peanut butter & jelly wraps, then trekked onward. The rocks got bigger!
We reached Annapolis Rock, named that for all the rocks we had to step over before we could set up camp. Did you know Rocksland comes before Rocksylvania on the AT!?!?
We climbed into our tent just in time before the rain started falling. The sweet sound of raindrops tapping on the roof was like a lullaby singing us to sleep. Sweet Dreams!!!","Dahlgren Backpackers Campground, Maryland

We were blessed with chipmunks scampering in the leaves, woodpeckers tapping on trees, carefree turtles crossing the path, colorful flowers & fungi growing everywhere. There is never a dull moment. Then when you least expect it, the most dreaded creature on the AT appears!! You scream in terror! You try desperately to get away as quickly as possible! You call for help, but this horrifying fear is in everyone’s eyes and hearts!!! You are helpless! What is it?!?! The teeny tiny dreaded TICK!

So what do you do? Crush it with all of your might! Immediately, everyone in camp checks their bodies and sleeping gear. We giggle before drifting off to sleep because we have conquered the most fearful creature, thereby making us Heros on the AT!","Annapolis Rock, Maryland

Let’s discuss masks for a moment... we do not wear masks! We are already huffing & puffing enough while hiking, then we tried to add a mask. Yep, that won’t work!!! Instead, we keep our distance! After all, we are thru hikers...we stink!!!! No one wants to come near us! LOL!

Guess we are still working on our hiker’s legs. There is a lot of huffing & puffing going on. We are no longer “misting,” but now sweating buckets as we hike up and down the hills & rocks. 
Meal planning is the highlight of our day. Just in case you didn’t know, hikers eat the worst food you can put into your body, yet we are the healthiest! High calorie meals with lots of junk food supplements to stave off hunger & quick pick me ups so you can trek up that steep mountain. Hikers we meet along the way ask what delicacies we will be enjoy today. We all seem to be enjoying the same meals. Hummm, something is seriously wrong with this picture!!! As we sit on our comfy chairs (rocks or logs), we dine on tuna wraps, peanut butter and jelly wraps, repeat! So today, a fellow hiker asked what we were eating for lunch and without hesitation, Swamp Irish responded... Filet Mignon! That made the tuna taste so much better!

There is graffiti on the AT! You heard me right the first time. Colorful expressions of hiker art, painted on canvases of boulders. Keep in mind, the artists had to trek rough terrain to create their masterpieces. We gazed in awe, then trekked on toward Pen Mar Park.

The temperature was in the high 80s as we paused to rest and “camel up” at the watering hole in the park. We must have looked exhausted and in need of a ride into town to Cobblestone Hotel because a kind gentlemen strolled towards us, chatting, welcoming us to Pen Mar. He then asked if we needed a ride. Being newbies, we are amazed of the kindness of others. The gentleman was Dennis who had the shuttle service for the area in the AWOL Guide. He gave us a tour of the area on our ride to the hotel.

We giggled as we lay in a comfy bed, clean, and fully supplied. Because of a simple Walk in the Park, we had a perfect ending to a perfect day. The Appalachian Trail will supply and care for your every need by sending Trail Angels like Dennis!","Raven Rock Shelter, Maryland

Trivia...the Mason-Dixon Line was named for Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon who had been commissioned to survey the area. What an honor! We learn something new every day!!

As we trekked an easy trail of ups & downs in the mid-90s under a canopy of trees, we came across our first trail magic…a Boo-Boo Box of Band-Aids. We were so excited! We giggled and thanked our trail angel for the couple of items taken from the box of treasures. Hopefully, we will never need them!

Our day was filled with beautiful foliage trekking to Deer Lick Shelters where we set up our little mansion/tent for the night. There was no need to put the rain fly on tonight. Instead, we watched the fireflies as we drifted into a peaceful slumber!","Pen Mar Park, Maryland

Jack fell down and broke his crown & Jill got blisters after. A funny thing happens when you fall...as if the fall is not enough, the backpack hits you in the back after the fall!!! Have you guessed...the terrain was flat for a while, and we giggled saying, “We’ve got this!” Glad to report that all is well with the trail magic-bandaged boo-boos.

Today, we were treated with trail magic twice: water first and then further down the trail, warm heavenly sodas!!!

Tumbling Rock is where we dined on our trail version of crawfish etouffee (ramen noodles with tuna). Yummy! The terrain quickly changed to steep, rocky trekking. After the Chimney Tops mountain, the terrain changed back to easy slopes with small rocks. It was very hot, in the mid 90s, so we welcomed the cool rain. We arrived at mile marker 1081.9, Rocky Mountain Shelters, greeted by a fellow hiker who had water waiting for us. Pure Magic!

Mile one: rocky, easy up, easy down hike using trekking poles. Mile 2: we gazed upon Massive Beautiful Boulders. Oh wait! Where is the trail? All we could see were white markers on trees in the sky. This gave a new meaning to “Hug a Tree!” Forget trekking poles; we officially became rock climbers for the next 30 minutes, hugging boulders, trees, or whatever was handy. At times, we were on our hands and knees climbing and praying for this tiny adventure to pass quickly. After climbing the last boulder, we giggled and shouted! At that very moment, a younger hiker took to the enormous rocks...huh…he came and went so quickly! We thought we were watching the Wizard of Oz and giggled as we trekked an easy last mile.

 

Mile marker 1084.9 led us to delicious BonFire Burgers and a cozy little hostel to rest our weary little heads. Nadia and Hamz shared bunks with us. As we drifted happily off to sleep, minus 23 pounds between the 2 of us, with full bellies, fresh showers, and clean clothes, we thanked God & Trail of Hope Hostel for the ending of a perfect day!","Rocky Mountain Shelters, Pennsylvania

Swamp Irish and Sugar Gal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629805,"Day 10Oh, we forgot to mention our first Hitchhiker Trail Angel on the way to the Trail of Hope Hostel yesterday. Caveman, a fellow hiker, mentioned how easy it is to get a ride into town if you hitchhike. So we did, giggling as a little pickup stopped to help hikers in need. A sweet young man told us to climb into the back of his pickup. Word to the wise...climbing into a pickup with a 28-pound backpack is not as easy as they show in the movies. They had to push & shove & tug & roll to get Sugar Gal into the truck! The moment we sat down, Tucker took off, speeding through town like a bat out of h*^#! We thought we were going to DIE, as we tried to hold on for dear life!! Tucker then slammed on his brakes and made a U-turn on 2 tires across 4 lanes of traffic…into a church parking lot! “Here you go”, he yelled. With shaking legs, we crawled out of the truck. Tucker sped away before we could even thank him. So here you go Tucker...“Thanks Sweetie!” By the way, we have learned our lesson...call Uber!!!! You just can’t make these things up!

Tina, the sweet trail angel from the Trail of Hope Hostel, returned us to the trailhead. The trail started with a hike through Caledonia State Park where families were fishing, cycling, swimming, and giggling. This perfect world quickly changed to a steep trek up the mountainside! Thank goodness that did not last long!! The trail turned to an easy, sandy path. Our clean clothes were now drenched with sweat because the temperature was in the mid 90s. Along the way, we passed a charming shelter called Quarry Gap Shelter, wild berries of all kinds for munching, and power lines that hummed, opening up to breathtaking views.

Upon arriving at Birch Run Shelter, we were informed that it would be raining all night so we chose to stay in the shelter. The shelter was very well kept with a privy that any hiker would love. There, we met an overnight hiker and a thru-hiker, Stitch. Stitch entertained us with hiking stories, keeping us giggling until night fall. We fell asleep, thinking & chatting of tomorrow’s adventures on the Appalachian Trail!","1084.9 marker – Trail of Hope Hostel, Pennsylvania

Shortly after leaving Birch Run Shelter while trekking an easy trail, we came across the “COVID-19 Bear Closure & Reopening 2020 Halfway” marking pole. We were honored to read the names of previous thru hikers who had signed the marker. Several had passed us as we trekked the AT... we’re as slow as the turtles we have seen on the trail. After signing the pole, we giggled (cause we are now FAMOUS LOL), and off we went.

The trail was filled with the usual ups, downs, and rocks. Let’s define rocks for a moment. In Pennsylvania, also known as Rocksylvania, rocks are like sand on a beach...constant...an endless beach of rocks!

Easy is 2 inch to 1 foot rocks (foot rockers).

Medium is 4 inch to 2 foot rocks (ankle rockers).

Large is 6 inch to 3 foot rocks (DANCE rockers).

And they keep getting bigger, & Bigger, & BIGGER!

You could say that here...rocks are “pivotal moments”!

However, the Appalachian Trail gives hikers a reprieve by placing blueberry bushes all along the trail for you to pop blueberries into your mouth, giving the palate great Joy!

We had the perfect ending to this rocky day by stopping in Pine Grove Furnace State Park for ice cream at the general store, hiker’s box treasures, cool showers at the mansion, clean clothes, comfy bed, & more giggles!","Birch Run Shelter, Pennsylvania

Upon leaving the Mansion, we decided to take a stroll through Pine Grove Furnace State Park...oh yeah, that is the Appalachian Trail! It was a delightfully easy stroll, and the rest of the day was fairly easy trekking. Why, with all of our energy, we trekked a blue blaze trail to Pole Steeple to enjoy a breathtaking view of surrounding mountains and valleys. We left our backpacks at the start of the trail...we giggled at the thought that no one hauled them off because...they were too HEAVY & miles from NOWHERE!!! The day was filled with beautiful flowers, colorful mushrooms, and creatively designed spider webs.

Setting up camp for the night near a secret stream we had discovered gave us a chance to filter and fill bottles of ice cold water and soak our tired feet. Crawfish Etouffee (ramen noodles with tuna) was our gourmet meal of the day! Yummy! Hey, don’t knock it until you hike over 11 miles carrying a Hiker’s Backpack! We laid our weary heads on comfy blown up pillows, enjoying lightening bugs as the flowing stream gently played tranquil music to serenade us to sleep!","Pine Grove Furnace State Park, Pennsylvania

We woke up this morning and said to ourselves, “Let’s go to a Rock Maze to climb more rocks!” And that is exactly what we did!! The trekking of the day brought us to a fascinating maze of huge boulders. The only way to find your way through the maze was by following white blaze markers on rocks and white arrows. It was fun to be on the lookout for white markings. We chatted with fellow hikers from the area, climbed boulders, hopped rocks, yodeled as if in the Alps, and giggled at the challenges of the day of mazes. Nowhere in our hiking prep had we been told of the adventures we would discover on the Appalachian Trail today.

The trail’s white markers, which led the way, were now on poles in the flattened fields of crops. Easiest trekking since we returned to the Appalachian Trail.... huh...the Guthook Guide app says, “You dummy! You’re LOST!” How can you get lost in an open field, you ask? Heck if we know, but we did find trail magic in the form of an ice chest of water left by a trail angel who must have been lost too! We giggled for another mile over the lost trail angel as Guthook guided us back on track to Boiling Springs!!

Once in Boiling Springs, we enjoyed a meal at Cafe 101, across the geese-filled lake from the ATC Mid-Atlantic Regional Office.

We contacted the nicest driver from Michael’s Shuttle Service who drove us to a nearby Microtel. Michael showed us where to resupply, get our knitting needles, and have a manicure. We giggled at his humor! He assured us that he would be at our beck & call if we needed him.

Once again, we lay in bed, clean clothes, freshly showed, giggling, and chatting about the day until we drifted off to sleep. The Appalachian Trail is truly magical!","1115 Stream Tent Site, Pennsylvania

After resupplying, Michael’s Shuttle Service drove us back to the ATC Mid‑Atlantic Regional Office to resume our hiking adventure. Michael is a very wise man! He informed us that it would be an easy trek through the flat lands of the valley. Low and behold, he was correct!

We thought we were back at home hiking the Mississippi levee in Louisiana. Mostly flat land through fields of corn and soybeans, with a 97-degree temperature as the high. After lunch, we laid near a field under a canopy of trees in Pennsylvania to rest as a cool breeze swept over us, causing us to drift into a sweet slumber while listening to birds singing and locus calling. After a brief nap, up we got & trekked on.

Sugar Gal rounded the bend at the end of the day, singing, and taking pictures. There, laying at her feet, was “100” written in flowers. Swamp Irish was grinning from ear to ear. “Guess the Flower Fairy knew you just completed 100 miles on the Appalachian Trail!” We giggled!!! Swamp Irish got a kiss for the fairy’s thoughtful gift!

Our plan for the night was to stealth camp in our cozy tent...Bomp! Wrong answer! With only crops or short shrubs, there was no place to set up our tent. What a bummer!!! We were broken-hearted!!! Guess we will have to stay in a hotel, complete with showers and the Middlesex Diner (that is the correct spelling of the diner!) nearby. With full bellies, clean bodies, and clean clothes, the Appalachian Trail had thrown a curve ball in our favor.

A funny thing happens when you stay in a hotel...you sleep late, you eat a large breakfast, and you start back to the trail later than when you are in a tent. That is exactly what happened. We began our day’s adventure about 10 o’clock. We hiked a half mile down a highway loaded with morning truckers. It’s HOT out here!

Today was a Piece of Cake!

The Appalachian Trail gave us a beautiful day, filled with easy trekking. ATC Scott Farm gave us trail magic of jugged water to refill our bottles. The lovely wildflowers along the path in Pennsylvania showed us the way to Katahdin! We mostly hiked through farmland of livestock with fields of hay bales.

Crossing a country road, we found a metal AT survey marker embedded in the asphalt. With great excitement, we giggled, danced, and took pictures. It was like finding gold!!!

There were different fence crossings: loop-de-loops, tiny openings, and step crossings. While we paused to feast on wineberries, Sugar Gal discovered she was missing part of a trekking pole. Whoa, Nelly! Stop the Presses! PANIC TIME!!! No Man Left Behind! We immediately dropped our packs and ran back through the open field to find it lying in the grass for the whole world to see. It wiggled off in a fence crossing. Swamp Irish made a quick repair and off we went, giggling that we had found it.

So much for the day being a piece of cake, ‘cause our last mile to Darlington Shelter was steep, rocky, and narrow...trekking poles were required!

As we laid in our tent, we giggled, thinking we were staying at the Taj Mahal! The privy was awesome…no odor, complete with toilet paper, a precious commodity of trail magic on the AT!","US 11 Carlisle Pike Mile Marker 1132, Pennsylvania

Our morning was an easy trek of ups, downs, small rocks, and through livestock fields, complete with freshly baled hay. Never let down your guard! It will hit you when you least expect it! The dreaded ROCKS! They started small, grew larger, became sharper, and finally became 2 foot stepping stones. Were we complaining? Heck, NO! Well maybe a little. It’s hard to complain when you are huffing and puffing in 95-degree heat. Ok, let’s add to the misery...Sugar Gal’s feet HURT!!!! However, the scenery made it with worth every step. Boulders placed perfectly to sit upon to enjoy the picturesque overviews.

The only reprieve was knowing there was a shower waiting for us in Duncannon. The town was a quaint old town. The Doyle Hotel, now used as a hostel, was charming and built well over 100 years ago. The owners were a Cajun from Louisiana and Cyclops (an AT Hiker with 2 eyes) who was also from Louisiana. Their Cajun southern accents magically returned, warming our hearts, when we began to talk.

We were home again, giggling, and speaking Cajun (y’all) as the sun set over the beautiful surrounding Pennsylvania mountains!","Darlington Shelter, Pennsylvania

At the charming Doyle Hotel/Hostel, sleeping in late was 6 a.m. After washing clothes and enjoying a yummy breakfast, we thanked the owner of the hostel for her sweet southern hospitality. She was delighted that we had rekindled fond memories of her Cajun decent and let us know that the pleasure was all hers. We all giggled as we parted ways calling to each other, “See Y’all Later! Be Sweet!”

The moment we stepped into the street; we were back on the Appalachian Trail. The trail meandered through the quaint little town of Duncannon, over the Juniata River, then back into the mountains. Our chatting and giggling came to a screeching halt, replaced by huffing, puffing, and (you guessed it) sweating. While in town, we picked up extra Sawyer water bags because we had once again been informed that Pennsylvania was having a drought, and it was breaking records for the hottest summer in history. This information did not stop us...we trekked on! Ok, this is different... the terrain went straight up and down with rocks getting larger and larger. Toes were stubbed, ankles twisted in ways we didn’t know ankles could bend, but our trusty trekking poles did what they do best...kept us standing. Then we came to the summit peaks that had enormous rocks and boulders resembling Superman’s Mansion with sharp edges shooting up from the ground at a slant. Holding on tight to these boulders allowed us to scale the peak’s edge for long distances at a time. This was a new challenge we had not encountered before, yet was a magical adventure. We mentioned at the same time that we were scaling Superman’s Mansion...so we must be SUPERMAN, then giggled. At one point, we shucked our packs, lowered them to the next boulder, hugged a tree, and lowered ourselves to the boulder where our packs safely rested. Once we climbed off the last peak, we felt powerful for conquering these masterpieces of stone. A short trek later, we arrived at Clark’s Ferry Shelter, gathered water, and set up camp.

The late-arrival AT hikers who trekked into camp must have felt like Supermen too! They serenaded us with song as we drifted off to sleep after giggling at their off-key pitch. Hope they don’t quit their day jobs...oh, never mind…they already have. That is why they are on the Appalachian Trail!

Ok, we discovered the next morning that they cheated and took the Susquehanna Trail (1 hour hike); it is steep, but easier than the AT. LOL!

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain...in record time, we applied the rain fly and collected the clothes from the line. We giggled, snuggled, and drifted into a sweet slumber.","Duncannon, Pennsylvania

“Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise!” All this walking makes us healthy. Fellow hikers like Jesse, have a wealth of information on water sources. We became wise and filled all water containers so we could trek to the next water source, 13 miles away. This is becoming the norm because of Pennsylvania’s dry spell.

Before leaving Clark’s Ferry Shelter, we sang Happy Birthday to Eric, one of the 3 Musketeers who arrived last night. They were hiking to the same shelter we were headed for, so we passed each other all day. The weather was overcast and cool, mid 70s, 90s by lunch.

The terrain started easy, became rocky with ups and downs after a couple of miles. The trail entertained us with logs to dance over and fed us refreshing blackberries to munch on along the way. After 3 miles over the cutting edge of the mountain again, it was back too easy trekking, just in time to arrive at Peter’s Mountain Shelter.

There, we joined up with the 3 Musketeers again to giggle at their entertaining stories of the day! The full moon sparkled through the trees as we lay in our comfy bed. The tree frogs began to croak at 8:30, right on time as usual, so in went the earplugs. We giggled that they knew when we were ready to go to sleep.

Here’s a bit of nature trivia we have learned – tree frogs stop croaking at exactly 4 a.m. and birds start singing at 5 a.m.! You guessed it, the birds are our sweet alarm in the morning. So up we got and off we trot. We still can’t figure out why we always have an easy trek to start the day. Easy turned to ups, downs, and more rocks. The trail decided to go straight down for an hour that led us to Clark’s Creek! Yea!!! Cold Clear Water!! And Trail Angels!!! Thanks to the Trail Angels, our break was complete with lounge chairs, cold drinks, cold water, trail mix, and enjoyable conversation about the upcoming trail with Slick, a 2014 thru-hiker, and Cathy. We knew we were still on the trail because Slick’s shirt was brown with a white blaze marker!

After refilling our water bottles, we trekked an easy hike on Horse-Shoe Trail to a nearby campsite. It was a beautiful campsite with stone chairs around the campfire. We enjoyed a meal of chicken flavored chicken with chopped pepperoni in the pasta. Yummy!! Our peaceful night was interrupted by raindrops. We giggled and rolled over to drift back to sleep because our rainfly was already over our tent.","Peter’s Mountain Shelter, Pennsylvania

The Appalachian Trail graced us with an easy day of trekking. The rising sun peeked through the trees, reflecting perfectly shaped spider webs in the shapes of CDs. Dinner plate sized colorful ruffled mushrooms adorned the trail. They looked like beautiful giant flowers. Much of the trail was overgrown with grasses, brier bushes, and wild flowers. We strolled through a dead forest with many fallen trees laying across the path for us to step over. At times, we felt we were playing hopscotch on the large flat rocks that lay in our pathway. We sang “What a Wonderful World,” changing the words to fit our surroundings.

After passing Rausch Gap Shelter, we chose to trek around the beaver dam. The trail led us to Second Mountain...not sure how we missed First Mountain. As we descended the mountain, we met up with PTL, a fellow hiker, who was finishing a 25-mile day. We giggled ‘cause we knew we were lucky to do 10 miles. We wished him well, and off he trekked.

Upon reaching our tentsite next to the trail, we slipped on our sandals, cooked a yummy meal, and pitched the tent on flat ground. As we nestled down to go to sleep, the tree frogs began to croak, letting us know it was 8:30, time to go to sleep.

Did you here what that Bear just called us? Hiker Trash! After 4 days of trekking the Appalachian Trail, our socks can stand up on their own, even though we air our clothes out on a line every night. We think we heard a Momma Bear tell her baby bears, “Do NOT touch or go near those hikers! They are stinky hiker trash.” And the bears ran away in fear yelling, “HIKER TRASH!”

We do wash down every night with bath wipes. No, there weren’t any bears.

Looking forward to going into town had us up at the crack of dawn! The Appalachian Trail was an easy 2.3 miles through fields of flowers and flowing streams. Then, 2.5 miles down Swatara Rail Trail to a KOA into Licksdale, Pennsylvania. The blue trail markers disappeared, so a kind day hiker pointed the way for us. He then commended us for leaving the trail due to the approaching hurricane. What? What? There is a Hurricane? We thanked him and instantly decided to take a Zero Day.

We giggled as we entered the hotel because the employees were not wearing mask for COVID-19 rules, but because we smelled!

The cool breeze on this day of steep, rocky terrain was a welcome pleasure from the previous hiking days with heat in the 90s. As the day progressed, so did the challenge of boulder climbing and trekking through overgrown trails. However, the trail delighted us with beautiful flowers, foliage with leaves in the shape of the AT symbol, and then out of the blue we giggled as we popped wine berries into our mouth to enjoy, forgetting the terrain for a moment. Ahh yes, wine and weddings, like the berries, make you happy, which make you giggle.

We were not the only hikers enjoying the fruits of the trail. Sky and Cornucopia, section hikers, also enjoyed their trek. It is always nice to take a break from huffing and puffing to chat with fellow hikers.

When we arrived at William Penn Shelter, our stopping point for the night, we discovered a piped water spring flowing icy cold water to refresh our water supply. We danced, after all that is all you can do on the wobbly rocks, in the steam and giggled as we filled water bags to haul back to the campsite! COOL!","Licksdale, Pennsylvania

The Appalachian Trail unfolds new adventures every day, and today would be very adventurous! The terrain started out flat and smooth, but quickly turned rocky. We danced, giggled, and took pictures of treasures we found on the trail: AT Survey Marker, pipe mushrooms, scary monster shaped tree roots, etc.

As we trekked forward thinking we were making good time, a fellow hiker, Cornucopia, zoomed around us. She giggled and said, “Race you to the parking lot down the trail.” Yeah, we knew she would be winning that race... and she did! Just as we reached the parking lot, we noticed that she was waiting for us. We thought, “Is she a stalker, a mugger, a crazy person, a... a trail angel?!” Our fellow hiker is A Trail Angel!!! The doors to her van were open and the van was filled with water, ham, cheese, roast beef, fruits, vegetables, ice cold sodas, etc. We ate until our hearts were content! Her sweet husband was meeting her at different places along the trail so she could slack pack. They closed the doors, and we were saying our goodbyes & thank yous when we noticed their license plate, GA to MA. We all giggled at the magic the trail gives us and off we went.

Now rocks will be rocks. They hide in the overgrown path, are pointy, and move as you step onto them. Even trekking poles can’t save you! You guessed it... Sugar Gal went down like a ton of bricks. But, never fear — she was saved by the thick foliage of briars. Yes, BRIARS! Did you know if all is right with the world, you can actually fall and never get stuck by the first thorn? HELP! I’ve fallen and I can’t get up! Yep! Swamp Irish came to the aid of the damsel in distress, unhooked her pack, and scooped her into his arms! He’s a Hero! As for the thorns, there was only one prick of a thorn.

We arrived at the beautiful Hertlein Campsite and set up the tent before dusk. The camp founder’s grandson chatted with us to give us history on the Boy Scout camp. Exhausted, we climbed into our cozy beds and giggled as we reminisced of our adventurous day on the Appalachian Trail!!","William Penn Shelter, Pennsylvania

Rain tapped lightly on the tent’s rain fly like soothing music during the night. We broke camp with a wet tent, gathered water from the several streams that ran through Hertlein Campsite, and were off to discover magnificent views of the day. The trekking was rocky, but fairly easy. Then all of a sudden someone hit the button and a fallen tree appeared. For the second day in a row, down went Sugar Gal, this time resting on her backpack in a nest of young soft mountain laurel. Not again! This time Swamp Irish was busy fighting off spider webs on the trail and not available to assist her. So off went the pack, up she jumped, pack reapplied, and she continued hiking while replying “Polo” to his “Marco”. We giggled and trekked onward.

We came across an assortment of mushrooms, a tree chair, and a hornet’s nest that hung from the overhead trees. It was perfectly shaped. We felt it was best if we just...Don’t Touch!

Later that evening, we gathered water to filter using a cup for the first time. Easy Peasy!

As we neared our tent site for the evening, it started to drizzle. No rain covers needed, we are almost there.

A boy, in his rain gear, passed us with a dog, and said he was headed to the next shelter.

The drizzle turned to a pouring rain. No rain covers needed, we are almost there!

A boy, in his rain gear, passed us looking for a boy with a dog. We told him he was headed to the next shelter.

The rest of the story... First thing this morning, we met 2 young lady hikers who asked, “Have you seen a boy? A boy with a dog is looking for his brother.” We informed her he was headed to the shelter or the next town last night. They contacted the boy with the dog. We all giggled, knowing everyone was safe. It is nice that we all watch over each other on the Appalachian Trail.

It must be National Hike the Appalachian Trail Day! Even Santa hikes this time of the year to keep in shape for Christmas. We let him know that we have been a good little girl and boy this year, and he giggled. The trail was filled with chatty hikers ready to share their knowledge of the trail. It was all we could do to make it over the rocky terrain, yet we discovered AT markers, amazing mushrooms, whimsical spider webs in the shape of shallow bowls, runners on the trail, and hikers eager to greet us. We were informed that we will love New Jersey. We were also informed that we were thru-hiking for nothing because we were not going to get a certificate. We just smiled, nodded, and replied, “Enjoy your hike” and continued our trek. There are many things we have learned in life. Certificates can be lost in a flood or a fire, washed in the washing machine, torn up, thrown away, etc. However, achievements are Life’s Sweet Journey that will remain with you forever! Hiking the Appalachian Trail is definitely an achievement in Life’s Sweet Journey! All other hikers wished us well. The last hikers we met gave us trail magic...peanuts from the famous peanut store in Port Clinton, Pennsylvania, because the store would be closed when we arrived in town the next day.

After being on the trail for several days, our electronics charger was dead. Sugar Gal has a photo addiction, so you guessed it, her phone was dead. Swamp Irish is down to his last 12%. So he did what any good hiker would do...turned on music to listen to “It’s Five O'Clock Somewhere” by Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett. We giggled and danced while cooking supper, then listened to “Little Bitty” by Alan Jackson. Who needs electronics when you have each other and the Appalachian Trail crickets to sing you to sleep?

Well, we woke up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed because we were headed to town to get showers and real food! Never mind...back the bus up! The Inn would be closed because of COVID-19, hence, no shower.

Our trek into town that was to take 3 hours was very, very, very steep downhill, extremely rocky, and you guessed it, Sugar Gal went down again. Maybe we should take her trekking poles away from her!!! Never mind, they saved her! Did you know trekking poles can bend to a 90 degree angle, hold you up, not break, but pop back into shape and hit you in the face once straight as if to say, “You big dummy”?!?! Sugar Gal ended in the upright position, sitting on a flat rock. Thank goodness for small miracles! That boulder rock was the reason for the fall and for the save. Yea!!!!

Five hours later we arrived in beautiful Port Clinton, safe and sound.

Now, you know you must be lost when someone pulls up to you and says let me take you where you need to go. They don’t even ask if you are lost! How do they know these things? Well let’s see... this is a hiker-friendly town (it says so on the signs), you have that puzzled look on your face, you keep pointing while looking from side to side, and you’re wearing a backpack with an AT tag hanging on the back! Duh!!! The nice gentleman gave us a tour of the tiny town, showing us where to get precious water, where to set up camp for the night, where to eat, and how to find Steve, the shuttle driver, if needed. Our friendly tour guide dropped us off at the restaurant, never to be seen again. After feasting at the Port Clinton Inn, we thanked them for allowing us to charge our phones, then headed to the park on the river to set up camp. We took pictures along the way. In the middle of town we came across an old bus painted with bats and a peace sign. We giggled, calling it the “Old Hippie Bus”!

Before dusk, a couple walked into the park to go tubing down the river. Low and behold, they were the Hippies who owned the Old Hippie Bus! We giggled and chatted with them until they got into the river.

The day was warm with a gentle breeze to cool us from time to time. Icy cold spring water was plentiful, so we were able to refresh our water supply when needed. We came across refreshing blackberries that tickled our taste buds!
A fellow hiker, Bumblebee, stopped to chat with us, giving information about the upcoming trail. He had hiked the area and was doing a repeat. We don’t think we will ever do a repeat of this rocky steep terrain. LOL

Today was the day of colorful mushrooms. The most unusual color we came across was the green mushroom.
Snake...run for your lives!!! Swamp Irish paused during his trek today to play with a baby snake. He was fearless because the trekking pole was bigger than the snake!

Later that evening, we met up with Bumblebee again at Windsor Furnace Shelter where we stopped for the night. All exchanged adventures of the day while cooking supper.

Even though Windsor Furnace Shelter was spacious, we decided to sleep in our home away from home…our cozy tent. There is nothing so peaceful as sound of raindrops hitting the roof of the tent before going to sleep. The rain stopped, and the fire flies lit up the campground with their magical lights. We giggled as we watched them. The giggling abruptly ceased when we heard a loud crackle as a huge tree fell to the ground with a bang, right near our tent.

That is where we came across a breathtaking view of Pulpit Rock and Pulpit Rock Astronomical Park! We giggled as we gave a sermon on the rock. The giggling didn’t end there, for we laid in the grass in the park, making-believe we were looking at the stars. All we could find was the moon...oh yes, that qualifies for a star!!

We met runners and day hikers throughout the day going much faster than us. The Appalachian Trail suddenly bequeathed pleasant terrain! Oh yes, what a wonderful trekking day.  Then suddenly in all it's glory, a magical '200' message left by the Mushroom/Leaf Fairies lay on the log before us! We giggled taking pictures as we danced enjoying the 200 milestone!  The last 3 miles of our trek was an easy up & easy down with a darling mini cairn.
At the end of the day, we decided to stay at the Eckville Shelter, which was closed (due to Covid) except for the tent area. Our tent was pitched on the tent pads and supper was almost cooked on the picnic table when a gentleman yelled, “Hikers! Hikers!” Shhh! Stop giggling and hide!!!! Too late, he has spotted us! After all, our Marmot 3P tent is a knock-your-socks-off orange color!! The gentleman’s name was Lazee, the caretaker trying to get our attention to see the young fawn in a nearby field.

It was a perfect ending to a perfect day as we lay on our comfy Nemo sleeping pads, clean, watching fire flies filling the campground with twinkling lights and the sky filled with twinkling stars!

After ending yesterday’s Appalachian Trail trek on easy terrain, we were ready to take on the world! Life (and the AT) can be deceiving. The day was filled with little pokey rocks with no place to put your hiking boots and medium sized rocks to stump your toes and rock your world as you tried to keep from falling, using your trekking poles at all times. Then there were boulder fields to climb on your hands and knees, using no trekking poles. Is anyone listening out there?!?! The rocks HURT MY FEET!!! The odd thing is everyone else is running past us like we’re on the interstate. 
All of a sudden, the trail gives you wineberries and blackberries to make you happy; beautiful mushrooms and flowers to brighten your day; and frogs, squirrels, chipmunks, deer, and other creatures to entertain you so you forget your feet. How Sweet!!!

We finally arrived at Allentown Hiking Club Shelter for an evening of relaxation. We picked up the sign in book to discover all hikers have the same issues...ROCKS! Duh! We’re in Pennsylvania/Rocksylvania! LOL

We could use some ice cream to cool us off. There is a sign in book or journal at every shelter so hikers may write whatever their little hearts desire. So, our entry was, “ROCKY Road! I SCREAM!! We enjoyed the shelter! Thanks!”

We trekked a trail of all size rocks, from small sharp rocks to fields and fields of boulders. Along the way, we enjoyed beautiful flowers, colorful mushrooms, and breathtaking views. Blackberries were sprinkled along the trail for our enjoyment. Water was found at the Thunderhead Lodge spigot, behind the building. They are AWESOME for allowing hikers to resupply.

There are a few things you must know about trekking the Appalachian Trail. Trees have fallen onto the trail, so you will need to cross them the best way you know how. Let’s see...you will find head bangers, knee knockers, & toe stumpers. We came across all of the above today. The most interesting was the waist wackers, hum…can’t climb over, so you crawl under! We got on our hands and knees, ducked, slithered under, and giggled. Appalachian Trail hikers are smarter than you think! They invented the first Round About! The trail goes straight, a tree falls blocking the trail, hikers scratch their heads, and change the trail by going around the end of the uprooted tree. The Roundabout is created (Don’t tell the ATC that hikers have messed with their trail.)! After we crawled under the tree, we spotted the Trail Roundabout, scratched our heads, and giggled louder. We are learning something new every day and loving the Appalachian Trail Wonderment!!!","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter, Pennsylvania

We all have one of those days when you feel you can conquer the world and do no wrong! Today was that day!!!

After a restful night, we started our well-planned day with a healthy breakfast of grits. We trekked the ridge of the mountains like Ridge Runners bouncing from rock to rock...well, we were on the ridge, but forget the runner part. Instead, we were able to hop from rock to rock with the help of our trekking poles, climb boulder field after boulder field, and get lost only once. Luckily, a fellow hiker (Duke & Dutchess the dog) pointed the way.

Since it was the weekend, we were greeted throughout the day with many hikers of all ages, giggling as they passed us on the way up and then again on their way back down the mountain.

We were right on schedule as we arrived early to the spot where we were to meet our Shuttle Driver. We waited and waited and waited...no shuttle arrived, so with great confidence we mapped out our trek into town. We hiked and hiked and hiked. Word to the wise...check Guthook periodically!!! I think we are lost! Guthook is showing we have fallen off of the face of the earth! No Problem! Let’s take this path. Duh! Problem! I think we have taken a wrong turn... The trail has taken us to a rock cliff. Hum... let's jump off the little cliff of 6 feet. OUCH!!! Oh Dear... We are in an industrial plant of some kind with a chain link fence all around the facility. What’s the worst that can happen? We could be arrested, they would bring us to jail, feed us, and give us a place to sleep for the night. At this point, we began to giggle, thinking we were Bonnie & Clyde! We found a small opening in the fence, climbed out and hurried into town just in time to check into Bert’s Hostel.

After a yummy supper and a hot shower, we laid in bed giggling, thinking that the Appalachian Trail had led us on an adventurous journey today!","Bake Oven Knob Shelter, Pennsylvania

Ahh it is so nice to return to the Appalachian Trail! We welcomed the cooler day (in the 80s) as we played hopscotch over the ridge runner rocks with mostly level terrain. However, just so we didn’t get bored the trail threw a knock-your-socks-off peak boulder field (high, peaky, with a breathtaking view)! Once in a while the trail crossed paths with power lines and towers so we named them ‘Power to the Tower!’

Swamp Irish was the leader! The leader is the most important person on the trail...warning of head bangers (trees laying over the trail head height…OUCH), sharp pointed rocks (Tripp Trippers), spider web catcher (kind of like a dream catcher, you hope you never get caught in one), finder of odd lizards (orange wiggly creature), snake scarer (Jump, ‘Shout! Shout! Let it all out! These are the things I can do without!’), and briars (hiker bush-grabber).

It is amazing that all hikers you meet have the time to stop and chat briefly (in real life...break time and giggle!). Nah was a hiker in training who hopes to hike the trail next year. Nah is the name we gave him because when asked, his response was, “Nah, I don’t have a trail name.”

Slip and Poncho were thru-hikers with a wealth of information about the upcoming trail magic. Mun, a Trail Angel, left the most valued Trail Magic...WATER! We giggled, filled our bottles, thanked Mun with a TY note, and trekked on!

At the end of the day, it began to rain. The Orange Mansion went up in record time! The rain stopped, we giggled, and opted to enjoy a delicacy on the trail for supper...peanut butter sandwiches!!! As we snuggled, we fell asleep full, exhausted, happy, and Zzzzzzz.","Bert’s Hostel in Palmerton, Pennsylvania

Our clothes were wet from yesterday’s rain, so we hung them on our backpacks...a perfect clothesline for this cool morning.

We are enjoying the trek on the Appalachian Trail today, complete with colorful mushrooms, a bird’s nest, magical water droplet spider webs, delightful flowers, and a special discovery of two metal Appalachian survey markers which made us giggle. Then there’s ups and downs, all sizes and shapes of rocks, sharp moveable rocks, boulder fields, rock fields...did we mention there are rocks on the trail in Pennsylvania! LOL

Water was our main goal to replenish our bottles today and the water droplet spider webs were just lacking water by a few drops. Many watering holes were dry, but Mun came through for all the hikers on the trail by leaving water cash Trail Magic at road crossings. We Thank You Sweetie!!!!

There were lots of hikers on the trail today. We encountered fellow thru-hikers Valley Forge, Brite, and Rabow as well as weekend hikers Social and Sumac. We swapped trail information of upcoming trekking…that’s always helpful.

We lay in our cozy tent mansion at a tent site on the side of the trail and drifted off to sleep only to be awakened by a flash of lightening, then the roar of thunder. We said “lightening” at the same time, giggled, rolled over, and went back to sleep.","Delps Trail Tentsite

‘We will, we will rock you!’ by Queen was our favorite song today while climbing, jumping, hopping, tiptoeing, or just stepping on a terrain of solid rocks. Wait! We lied, we enjoyed a few moments of no rocks hiking on the cliff’s edge! Cliff Notes: take note, it’s a cliff, be careful! Awe, the Appalachian Trail versatility!!!

Our enjoyment for the day was watching chipmunks, eating pepperoni cracker sandwiches, searching for mushroom flower clusters, collecting blueberries, discovering AT Survey Markers, and wandering around for water. Such an amazing day that only got better when we arrived at Kirkridge Shelter where we met George & Chris (weekend hikers) and Haley & Haley (section hikers), southbound. We giggled while swapping adventures for hours!

Our Marmot 3P Tungsten tent townhouse can be put up with our eyes closed, but we used our head lights tonight. Climbed onto comfy Nemo mattresses that only take 4 puffs of breath to blow up. Yeah, right...more like 8 puffs for Sugar Gal. Here is the good part…our little pillows take 8 puffs. It gets cool at night, so we wiggle into Browint large sleeping liners, then cover with an Enlightened Equipment quilt. It is all these treasures that make night life on the Appalachian Trail light, comfy, and feel like home! Now we’re ready to snuggle, giggle, and drift into a sweet slumbering peaceful night.

Is it legal to cheat on the Appalachian Trail?!?!? Today started as easy trekking with smaller rocky sharp rocks. Our trek took an easier road for about 2 miles up, then off to a rocky trail. We watched the road run parallel to the trail and wondered if we should have taken the side road down. Hum, that would have been cheating! But our feet would have loved us!!

There were many masked day hikers who avoided us like the plague. Not sure if it was because we were too slow (they passed us going up and down the hill), were stinky hikers (and we were), or had no mask (for which we were reprimanded, but we kept our distance while huffing and puffing as her husband apologized for her comments). We never met a thru-hiker with a mask! All of a sudden, a young man whizzed past us, stopped, then turned around to ask if we needed anything. We smiled and shook our heads. When we finished the trail for the day, the same young man was waiting for us with Cliff bars in hand, apologizing he didn’t have more for us. His family waited patiently at a distance. “I’m Socrates, a 2015 thru-hiker.” We giggled (our AT tag is the giveaway), chatted, and thanked him. The Appalachian Trail sends Trail Angels with Trail Magic that will touch your hearts forever!

The trail took us through a lovely little town (Delaware Water Gap) where we stayed the night. We pondered about what to eat for supper on our trek to the hotel. Sugar Gal selected peach pie and chicken potpie from the local bakery. Swamp Irish selected BBQ burnt ends on a bun, baked beans, sodas, and a pistachio milk shake (Sugar Gal enjoyed) from Joe Bosco! Swamp Irish will be talking about his BBQ FOREVER!

We checked in at the hotel, feasted on our selections, bathed, and washed clothes. Lying in bed, we giggled at the sweet adventures the Appalachian Trail gave us today and thanked the Dear Lord for the kindness shared by strangers!","Kirkridge Shelter, Pennsylvania

Hi Ho, Hi Ho, it’s off to the trail we go! A fellow hiker, Post Card, met us in the lobby of the hotel as we were leaving this morning. Who knew we would cross paths later in the day? Today was an easy trek hiking through town where we also met The Captain, a 2013 thru-hiker. He assured us our boots would thank us in New Jersey. Oh No! Joe’s BBQ! Swamp Irish rubbed the sign for good luck, then we continued on. We crossed the Delaware bridge as it shook with excitement (never mind, that was big trucks whizzing by) when we approached the state line of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. We crossed the line, paused, took pictures, and giggled because we had just finished hiking through our second state on the Appalachian Trail. Our trek for the day was fairly easy until the last rocky mile before reaching our destination. Once there we ran into Tar, a section hiker, & some Trail Caretaker Angel's who knew Mun giggled and swapped information of the upcoming trail.

Swamp Irish’s mind was miles away at times...at the BBQ place today of course.

The day’s trekking came to an end at the Backpacker Campsite where we met up with thru-hikers Post Card and Lucky Charms, then collected brown water to be treated twice. Water is water! We cooked a yummy supper, listened to fireworks in the valley, and then it happened...the cicadas started chiming in sync at 8 p. m. We both said, “Time for bed” then giggled and into the tent we went! Sometimes the Appalachian Trail is so predictable!","Delaware Water Gap, Pennsylvania

Oh boy! We’re going to win this race! Up and at ‘em and away we go…to get on the trail first. The terrain was rocky with lots of rock climbing, but the views were beautiful, trekking around Sunfish Pond. We could smell honey from a honey bee hive as we watched bees fluttering from flower to flower. Shortly after getting to the pond, Post Card passed us as we all giggled. Before we finished circling the pond, Lucky Charms (on his 93rd day on the trail) sped by as we all giggled again. Swamp Irish couldn’t remember their names, so he renamed them Postage Stamp and Cheerios, causing us to giggle more and more. The further we trekked, the darker it got until the sky opened up, getting us soaking wet right before we reached Mohican Outdoor Center. Like wet rats, we were clopping in the water that ran down the path. The rain came and went as quickly as Post Card & Lucky Charms. Guess who was having lunch at the outdoor center when we arrived? You guessed it...Post Card and Lucky Charms. Post Card had been reading the sign in books at the shelters and remembered where he had heard of us. We’re Famous!!! We giggled, said our goodbyes, ate lunch, and filled our water bottles at the outdoor center spigot.

Later down the trail, we saw a weekend hiker pulling his backpack on wheels. We scratched our heads and giggled, thinking he will never make it over the upcoming rocky terrain. The Appalachian Trail is extremely entertaining!

Tonight we slept at a little tent site (areas along the trail to camp for the night) on the side of the trail. Snuggled down for the night, we reminisced of today’s sightings: blue-green mushrooms, orange lizard creatures, yummy blueberries, bear growl...BEAR GROWL! Get up, make noise, turn on all the head lights!!! We could hear the other hikers around us screaming and running!! Wait a minute! A black bear is not going to come into a crowded campsite growling. Then the laughter began from the practical jokers. The camp was filled with laughter as each camper yelled at the jokesters.

Trekking was a “Rock Around the Clock”  day. The entire day was filled with rocks. We thought there would be no more rocks when we entered New Jersey...well that didn’t happen! So we have added a few new vitamins to our daily routine: vitamins T & I (Tylenol & Ibuprofen). Ahh, much better! But no worries, since we can only look down (to keep our footing), we find marvelous mushrooms! Now, if you are looking down, you’re not looking up, and bam! you just ran into a spider web. Did you know there are two sizes of spider webs? Body spider webs and face spider webs. While Swamp Irish fights off the spiders and their webs, Sugar Gal giggles and sings. “I see skies of blue, spider webs too, here come the rocks, I can’t save you, and I say to myself What a Wonderful World.’ 
Have no fear, except for the spider webs, the trail blessed us with blackberries today!

We met Sean, a section hiker, who shared a wealth of information about the upcoming trail. It is always a pleasure to meet such delightful hikers like Sean. We hope to see him at Katahdin or Shenandoah!

The Appalachian Trail decided rocky was not enough of a challenge for us, so it added mini boulder climbing today to fight the boredom.

There were many hikers on the trail, including the gentleman who was taking a nap on the trail. Literally, On the Trail! We checked to make sure he was okay, trekked around him, giggled, and continued our journey!

Then there were the 2 day hikers who asked our opinion of how to proceed to their car. They decided to take the steep rocky trail instead of the road to the parking lot because it was shorter...we giggled for the next mile!

A young lady hiking with a group asked, “Where does this trail go?” We responded, “To Georgia, just keep following the white blazes.” Everyone in her group giggled. We trekked onward.

We arrived to the shelter for the evening to discover the spring was flowing. We refilled our water bottles, cooked a scrumptious supper, climbed into our sleeping bags, and giggled at the entertaining hikers we met today before drifting off to sleep.

Wow! Did you know there are rocks in New Jersey too?!?!? But, we bet you didn’t know that there are Rock Fairies in New Jersey! We crossed the Tinsley Trail this morning when, out of the corner of our eye, we noticed something magical on a boulder rock. There it was, in all its glory, a 300 fashioned from rocks. We giggled, took a picture, and trekked to Sunrise Mountain Overlook to celebrate this special occasion! Rock Fairies are very wise and knew we were celebrating 300 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail, so they sweetly left us a spectacular marker!

On the trail, everything is beautiful, including ugly mushrooms! (Hold your horses! There is more to this than meets the eye. Keep reading.) Therefore, we dubbed today Ugly Mushroom Day while taking pictures of them. Some mushrooms are good to eat and some are poisonous. So, we don’t eat any of them. It was very fitting that we met Poison, a southbound hiker. We chatted about our adventures, giggled, and trekked on, taking pictures of ugly mushrooms while thinking of Poison.

We have come to the conclusion that the person who wrote the book “‘There are Rocks in my Socks!’ Said the Ox to the Fox” must have been an Appalachian Trail thru-hiker!

Today, our reprieve from the rocks was that the terrain wasn’t too steep, and the Appalachian Trail graced us with a cool breeze from time to time.

As usual, Sugar Gal was lollygagging, taking…you guessed it…pictures of mushrooms. Like we need more pictures of MUSHROOMS! All of a sudden, there was a rustling in the woods and stomping, then the rustler crossed the path in front of Swamp Irish. He yelled, “Get up here, NOW!” A black bear just ran by him. Our goal in life was not to see rattle snakes or bears, so we were shaking in our (hiking) boots. To this day, we are not sure who was supposed to protect whom from the bear! Onward we trekked with adrenaline pumping at full speed.

A short time later, we caught up with a section hiker and Sophie the dog...bear food?...at least we hope not. We informed them of the bear sighting ahead.

Accidents are truly a blessing. We are using the Appalachian Trail AWOL Guide & Guthooks so that we don’t get lost in the wilderness. We discovered recently that Guthooks has a place for hikers to leave comments. Upon opening High Point State Park Headquarters information (accident), a sweet hiker left a comment about Mosey’s Place, a hostel in Port Jervis, NJ. What the heck...let’s call 845-239-3028! Immediately, she stopped what she was doing, picked us up (she was about 6 miles away), brought us to get something to eat, resupply, and then to her cozy home. We bathed and washed stinky hiker clothes. Let us introduce you to Mosey. She is a 2013 thru-hiker, is very kind, a pleasure to talk with, cooks the most amazing breakfast, and returned us to the trail! We were happy as little larks. The cost is $30 per hiker for the entire package! We give her 4 stars & a smiley face (the highest ranking you can get) and strongly recommend Mosey’s Place to all future hikers! One wise tip left by Mosey...do not go to or stay at Fingerboard Shelter because of the super friendly bear who is aggressive, taking hikers’ backpacks & food!!!

We are rested and ready to tackle anything the Appalachian Trail throws at us today...hmmm, maybe not anything. Well, today it was steep, rough, and rocky terrain until High Point Shelter, then the terrain changed to easy with fewer rocks and boardwalks. Sweet! We enjoyed the fields, a nice breeze from time to time, beautiful flowers, colorful mushrooms, but not the garden snake. All in all, it was a pleasant trek. We giggled when we discovered Andrea, a Trail Angel, had left Trail Magic of V8 juice, mini Oreos, water, and fruit cups. It could not have come at a more needed time! As always, it is a pleasure to cross paths with fellow hikers and swap upcoming terrain information. Today we met southbound thru-hikers Steady and Irish Bastard.

Our goal was to reach Unionville, where we would stay in another hostel. The hostel was affiliated with the Unionville Presbyterian Church at the home of Pastor Doug (Banzai, a thru-hiker). It also gets a 4-star and a smiley face rating! We bathed, washed our stinky hiker clothes, relaxed while chatting and giggling with Banzai and his family (Hotdrinks and Maple Cakes).

After a delightful stay with Banzai and his family, we are back to the Appalachian Trail. Swamp Irish blazed the trail, clearing the path for Sugar Gal as we giggled of the adventures in Unionville. He walked a few feet ahead and when out of the brush, a deer ran between us. The dear was so close we could feel the wind as it sprinted past, and the vibrations of the hoofs hitting the ground could be felt through our hiking boots. Sugar Gal almost got run over by the deer! That was enough adventure for the day. But no, a snake slithered by, then a little further up the trail, a bear decided to lollygag across the trail to the other side. We froze in our tracks ‘til the bear was off into the woods.

We trekked on. The terrain was easy hiking past fields, on board walks through swamps, hiker benches to rest upon, and around a wildlife refuge filled with ducks.

We had the pleasure of meeting several hikers, Dream Catcher & Kuick (pronounced Quick), on the trail who stopped to chat and giggle while exchanging trail information and adventures. Brandon, a section hiker, was at the shelter when we arrived. After much discussion, we all decided to stay in the shelter because of the storms passing through the area that night. Excellent idea (except for Swamp Irish...Brandon snored, Sugar Gal snored, and the mosquitoes ate him up)!

“Ride, Ride, Ride, Hitchin’ a Ride!”  Now don’t you just love it when the Appalachian Trail gives you something totally unexpected? As we trekked the up and down rocky terrain, zigzagging over rocks like mountain goats, we came across old abandoned cars. This was a “Wow Moment” as we paused to take pictures and admire them. Sugar Gal strayed from Swamp Irish and off the trail while taking pictures. After noticing the lack of white blazes on the trees, Guthooks guided her back onto the trail. Swamp Irish threatened to tie a bear bag string around her waist so he couldn’t lose her again. They giggled and trekked onward. The trail continued over boardwalks that teeter totter and a bog filled with frogs jumping into the water as if dancing in sync.

When we arrived at the Glenwood crossing, we decided we needed to take a break. It’s hard to ask day hikers wearing mask for directions into the closest town. We really need to hitch a ride and those old abandoned cars don’t run. Never fear, the Appalachian Trail always comes to our aid. Two Trail Angels, one of whom was the daughter of Subway (a thru-hiker), drove us into town. We had no idea where we were, but they made sure we were safe and sound before they departed. We will always keep their kindness in our hearts!

Taking a Zero Day from the Appalachian Trail to rest our weary bodies always gives us time to visit the local area. Swamp Irish decided we needed to take a walk around town without backpacks. We enjoyed the sights while giggling and having a tiny rock kicking contest down the sidewalk. We discovered a Subway sandwich shop and thought of our Trail Angels from yesterday. The Dug Out, a local food hut, was the perfect place to grab a chocolate cherry malt and a pistachio malt. Yummy!

Taking time off is the perfect time to share with you ideas we implemented before we began our journey on the Appalachian Trail. So keep or toss this information.

RIBBON! Who would have thought a simple piece of ribbon could make life so easy? Let’s start with clothes. ¼” wide grosgrain ribbon works best. Sew a 6” piece of ribbon (making it 3” in length when sewn) onto every zipper on your clothes. This makes grasping, zipping, and unzipping easy, especially when it is cold. Now, do the same for any backpack zippers that don’t have finger loops or tabs. Sew a small strip of ribbon on every piece of clothing: balaclava, neckerchief, underwear, shirts, pants, etc. Your clothes will get wet at one time or another and can now be hung to dry on your packs while hiking. Amazing how something so simple works so well!

Tent Pole Bag - we added a piece of ribbon to the bag, attaching a little carabiner to the end so it could be clipped to the backpack while in a side pocket. Many times, trees catch the bag but the pole bag is attached to the backpack so the poles stay secure. You would be surprised how many pole bags (with poles inside) we have found on the trail.

Tent Tabs - our tent came with a tiny red ribbon to indicate what tabs clasp together. We simply sewed white ribbon at the red ribbon so it could easily be seen. Most tent setups are at dusk ,so the white ribbon is easily seen.

Now, use your imagination sewing a lightweight ribbon on items to make your hiking life easy. See pictures attached to this posting (COMING SOON). Happy Hiking!","Central Valley, New York

Taking another Zero Day from the Appalachian Trail to continue our rest. Swamp Irish decided we needed to take a walk around town again without backpacks to the outlet mall.

We enjoyed window shopping. Whoa Nelly, back the truck up! Godiva Chocolates! So, in we went...smelled the chocolates, bought chocolates, ate chocolates, and giggled. Chocolate is a happy drug! Makes you happy to see it, excites the senses to smell it, and delights the palate to taste it! Then back to The Dug Out to grab a yummy Mint Chocolate malt.

Taking time off is the perfect time to let you know what works in the food and fine dining segment of our Appalachian Trail journey. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide these suggestions for gourmet meals.

What you enjoy today may not be what you enjoy on the trail. Neither of us were fond of ramen noodles but enjoy them now. We have changed our Cliff bar flavors many times. It’s okay to make changes in your food choices! When we started hiking, it was hard to eat, and we lost weight very fast. Chatting with a fellow hiker, we were advised to drink lots of water. Drink water after every bite. It is amazing what drinking water does for you. Although we were drinking more water than ever before, we were still dehydrated. Cornucopia, a section hiker, was a wealth of information about food.

We have learned many helpful tips from other hikers. Don’t add as much water as the package instructions say. In the Jetboil pot, add water, turn on the pot, add all food items, stir, bring it to a boil, stir, turn off pot, cover, and let sit 5-10 minutes. Stir after 5 minutes. You save fuel and your food is ready to eat in minutes without much work. We add items to our dinners (Knorr, Pasta Sides, Ramen Noodles, etc) such as Tony Chachere’s Seasoning, dried onion rings, onion soup mix, gravy mixes, etc. (Place these items in a snack zipped bag to carry to reduce the bulk and weight.) Add meats, changing each day. We rotate meats such as chopped pepperoni slices, chopped beef jerky (a little goes a long way), chopped Slim Jim, tuna packets, chicken packets, etc.

Breakfast is tough. We eat individual buttered grits, flavored oatmeal, breakfast bars, etc.

Lunch can be yummy. We found that hard bread carries well such as cranberry walnut bread, French bread, hoagies, etc. Crackers that are firm and left in the box also travel well. Even if the box is smashed, the crackers stay whole. Other “hard crackers” are Cheetos, gold fish, etc. Flour tortilla wraps are a good choice as well.

Snacks such as Snickers, Almond Joy, M&Ms, trail mix, dried fruit mix, energy bars, whatever your heart desires... You’re hiking, you’re hungry, eat!!!

Change your menus each time you resupply. Eat! Eat! Eat! Giggle and eat some more because you need the fuel to hike the Appalachian Trail!","Central Valley, New York

The excitement of returning to the Appalachian Trail gives you a rush like no other rush you have ever felt before!

Today was a cool crisp morning to walk the boardwalk. Upon entering the segment of the trail to the Stairway to Heaven, we met Donna, a day hiker. Her son, Stoker, was a thru-hiker in 2006. Donna trekked with us on the easy terrain except for the Stairway to Heaven, but it was not too bad. The Pinwheel Vista at mile marker 1360.9 had lots of day hikers. We all exchanged phones to take pictures and giggled while enjoying the breathtaking view. Off we went to continue our journey.

We put on our rain gear as it began to rain. A couple looking for the end of the trail asked us how far this trail goes. We responded Katahdin, Maine — about 830 miles. Their faces were priceless. She started yelling at her boyfriend because they had 4 miles to the parking lot and it had started to rain. We giggled and trekked on. We know it’s cruel and inhuman, but we love this GA-ME Game!

The rains stopped shortly after arriving at Wawayanda Shelter. We trekked to resupply water at the nearby state park, set up our orange tent townhouse, and cooked supper. Richard, a section hiker, informed us about the upcoming trail we would be hiking tomorrow.

“It’s raining cats & dogs,” we said at the same time. We giggled, rolled over, and went back to sleep. About 8 am, we dragged wet gear to the shelter, dried it, ate breakfast, and waited for the rain to slack up. We began hiking about 11 a.m.

The Appalachian Trail was wet as we trekked an easy rocky trail. Turkeys, squirrels, beautiful flowers, and colorful mushrooms along the trail entertained us. The terrain changed to steep ups and downs so we trekked more slowly! The wet rocks, roots, and leaves were slippery. Upon crossing the New Jersey line into New York, we took pictures of the Appalachian Trail survey marker, the highlight of our day. Then the terrain got worse with constant boulder climbing, at times on our hands and knees. We met No Stops, a southbound hiker, who helped us off of the cliff we were stranded on. She had just climbed up the boulder, mentioning it scared her because the cliff was slippery and dangerous. We felt the same way. She also informed us that the terrain was not going to get any better for several miles, but that was the worst boulder climb she had encountered today. That made us feel better, we thanked her, and we parted ways, trekking onward.

We were exhausted after a day of boulder climbing so we camped in a tent site area for the night. Safe and sound in our cozy sleeping bags, we thanked The Dear Lord for watching over us today. They say never quit hiking the Appalachian Trail on a bad day, but no one told us about dangerous days.

The Appalachian Trail provides us with all the comforts of home. There are logs and rocks to sit upon, cook on, an use for tables. Today, trees were used as closets to hang our treasures and keep our food safe from bears. Ahh yes, there’s no place like home!

The trail is still wet in places from yesterday’s drenching rain. That means rocks and roots are like black ice; you can’t see where they are wet and slippery. So, for the first 3 miles the terrain was extremely hard to trek and very dangerous. This made us put on our hiker thinking caps. Each step was taken with care. As the day went on, the trail dried out making the terrain easier to hike. This allowed Sugar Gal to begin to take pictures of, you guessed it…colorful ugly mushrooms and dainty flowers.

We met Neo, a northbound thru-hiker, who hurried passed us. He didn’t fool us for one minute. Neo wanted to get to the ice cream shop before us!!! The Appalachian Trail will provide everything you need. Today, it was ice cream from Bellvale Farms Creamery, complete with a charging station for phones and a water spigot to resupply our empty water bottles. We love this place!

With ice cream comes brain freeze. The Appalachian Trail Guide and Guthooks can only do so much, so...we scratched our heads and asked two day hikers from the area which way to go It’s amazing how they can tell by the look on your faces that you’re lost! We chatted, they pointed to a blue blaze that leads back to the white blaze, we giggled, and trekked in the right direction singing...“Yeah, I get by with a little help from my friends!” 
Our tent townhouse went up in record time, we cooked and ate a yummy supper, then lay in our cozy sleeping bags and giggled, singing about our two newfound hiker friends before falling into a sweet slumber. Oh, we are at home on the Appalachian Trail!!!","Tentsite at Mile Marker 1369.5, New York

Trekking the trail today was like any other day. We must be getting good at this...or maybe NOT! Happy Feet, a southbound thru-hiker, warned us of a boulder field of hands and knees ahead. We could have gone all day without this monstrosity! About that time, three elderly hikers were coming down the mountain with ease. We looked, we climbed, We Did It...with ease. Maybe we are getting better. LOL!

All in all, the day’s terrain was not too bad except for a small .10 of a mile that looked as though the trail had purposely been covered with solid rocks, large and small, from the stone wall that ran alongside the trail. We scratched our heads, looked to the left, looked to the right, and did what any wise hiker would do. Got off the marked trail, found a beaten path right next to the trail, and trekked on like the wise hikers before us. Whose idea was that?!?!?

Our main goal was to find H2O. This was on every hiker’s mind. As we emptied a bottle, we filled it up at the next, nearly dry, stream. That was wise on our part because we were down to 1/2 bottle by the time we went to sleep. Swamp Irish held up the bottle and yelled, “As God is my witness, I will never go thirsty again!” Sugar Gal giggled and replied, “That’s ‘hungry,’ Babe.”

There are tent sites scattered along the trail, complete with a rock fire ring and smooth ground to place a tent. We have no need, time, or energy to strike an evening fire. It doesn’t matter if the tent isn’t level as long as our toes are pointed downhill.

We snuggled into our comfy tent, chatting about the amazing teepee and foliage we saw, giggled at the red water we were not going to drink, and feeling sorry for the hiker who lost his food to the bear at Fingerboard Shelter (even after being warned). Our imaginations run wild at the adventures the Appalachian Trail has in store for us tomorrow!","Wildcat Shelter, New York

The perfect way to start a perfect day on the Appalachian Trail is with the first 1/2 mile boulder path, climbing on your hands and knees, but it was a doable climb in just under 1 ½ hours... for us. The trail was an easy trek, then steep coming down the mountain. What made the steep decent worth it was the fact that the Tuxedo Trail Angels had water trail magic waiting to refresh us at the bottom of the mountain. Thanks Tuxedo Trail Angels!

There’s an old saying, ‘Find a penny, pick it up, all the day you’ll have good luck!’ That may be true for a penny, but if it’s a quarter, leave it on the trail cause my pack cannot take more weight!!! And leave it we did! We trekked gentle flows (as the locals would say) on to discover a beautiful view of the valley and road below with sunlight sparkling on the car windshields like diamonds. Now, that’s a memory worth keeping!

At the Orange Turnpike, we noticed people gathering water from a spring spigot and an Appalachian Trail Survey Marker on the side of road. They both made us giggle and dance with joy!

We trekked on and met Bear Claw, a northbound section hiker, who whizzed past us earlier in the day. We traded trail information and left him rubbing his tired feet. No sooner had we left him when we ended up in the parks parking area. This was a “Where in the world is the white blaze?” moment! All of a sudden, crazy day hikers began yelling, “Thru-hikers!” Run, Sugar Gal, Run! Save the women and children! But Swamp Irish, they have watermelon and I’m hot and hungry! They ran toward us with pieces of watermelon in hand. More came at us with watermelon. We soon discovered they were happy to see us, were a hiking club, and had provided Trail Magic last year to hikers. This year they had seen very few thru-hikers. In a perfect world, we would never take candy from a stranger, and the watermelon was refreshing, sweet as candy. They filled cups with winter melon for us to drink, giving us energy to continue our trek. We drank the delicious beverage they had created and thanked them. They sent us off giggling, yelling, and waving like we were in a ticker tape parade. They are truly Trail Angels!

With all this excitement, we decided to set up camp early at a secluded trail tent site area. We scooped and filtered water from the nearby stream, pitched our tent townhouse, cooked supper, and hung our bear bag for the night (we were in bear country). Then, down the hill wandering into our campsite was a whistling day hiker. He looked around, we asked if he was lost, he said he couldn’t find the white blaze, so we pointed him in the right direction about 300 yards away, and giggled as he strolled away.

As the sun set over the mountain’s ridge, we snuggled down into our cozy sleeping bags, thanking the Appalachian Trail Angels of the day before drifting off into a sweet slumber!!","Tentsite Mile Marker 1383, New York

The Appalachian Trail graced us with easy rocky ups and downs, only 1 boulder climb, and lots of hikers. We were looking forward to the Lemon Squeeze, our only boulder climb for the day. The several hikers in the area exchanged ideas on how to trek the climb. We all succeeded with ease due to the help of each other. We giggled as a thru-hiker wanted to take the most difficult route. We left him on the mountain as he sighed, trying to figure out where to go next.

The many hikers we met were south bounders: Red Headed Stranger, Bubbles, Wiz, and Phoenix. Section hikers were some no-name hikers, Todd with 490 miles and Amazing Grace with 1000 miles. All hikers stopped to chat, giggle, and share information of the upcoming terrain.

The trail was filled with day and weekend hikers. Bypassing Fingerboard Shelter due to the bear closure, we met weekend campers who opted to ignore warnings. We giggled, wondering how that worked out for them and the massive amount of food they carried in with them.

Trekking on the trail presented several roundabout trees, rocks, and trekking poles. If you hold your trekking poles in one spot, at times you can make a full circle going around about the poles to make 1 step. Ugh! The trail entertained us with several deer, chipmunks, and chopsticks in a fire ring for kindling. Water is getting harder to find, which seemed to be the concern of the day for every hiker we met. We resupplied all water bottles every time we came to a spring, often scooping water while fighting off minnows as we scooped.

The charming stone William Brien Memorial Shelter was our shelter of choice tonight. There were lots of families camping and hiking the area. A hiker who had skipped the last water supply came to shelter looking for water. The shelter was dry. He left after hiking 21 miles today to gather water 2 1/2 miles ahead.

We set up camp for the night & cooked our last supper. We are running out of food; no breakfast or supper food is left. Have no fear, the Appalachian Trail has not let us down, and we still have peanut butter, crackers, and candy...Yum!

We lay in our warm comfy sleeping bags giggling. While we wait patiently for the cicadas to start chirping, we chatted about the tight Lemon Squeeze and the yummy Last Supper we enjoyed. The Appalachian Trail never lets us down with the cicadas chirping beginning promptly at 7:40 p.m. We giggle, put in the trusty earplugs, and fall into a sweet slumber!!","Tent Site Mile 1387.6, New York

Ahh, it will be a cool morning to trek this stretch of easy terrain on the Appalachian Trail. Yesterday was the Lemon Squeeze, today it is the Limb & Squeeze for the bushes have grown together, covering the trail. We did not get far before meeting Gandalf, a section hiker who encountered a black bear. She was at the next spring when a bear graced her with its presence. Gandalf stood tall with trekking poles in the air speaking loudly, moving sideways with no eye contact. She left the area and her pack, returning the next day to an undisturbed pack...poor little bear was just thirsty.

We trekked 2 miles from the shelter to the Visitor Center in the highway median. There was a water spigot in the back of the building for us to fill our bottles as well as snacks and breakfast items to resupply for the day’s trekking. We had FOOD, giggling while we munched on muffins and milk!

Onward we trekked, meeting section hikers, Happy Feet and Little Bear, who informed us of the upcoming terrain, flows as they call it in New York. Later we came across Rich, who maintains the trail, and his dog Logan. Rich had a wealth of information about the area, trail, and why there were hundreds of trees down (a storm the last week).

The last part of the trek took us to the stairs to Perkins Memorial Tower on Bear Mountain. It was a beautiful breezy day, bringing hundreds of day hikers who walked the hundreds of steps to the memorial. The stairs were actually not a hard trek for us. We were able to keep up with the day hikers. Yea!!! Every once in a while, a hiker would ask how much farther and we would say not much farther. Just follow the white blazes to Maine, giggling as they passed us. Did I tell you we love this GA-ME? The stairs ended at the city park where hundreds more were celebrating Labor Day weekend. We found a family enjoying Popeye’s Fried Chicken! We looked at each other, giggled, and asked had we taken a wrong turn hiking back to Louisiana?!?!?

The Appalachian Trail white blaze marks led us through the park, around the zoo, and over the bridge to our pickup point.

Grandpa’s smiling face greeted us as he picked us up near the Bear Mountain Bridge. He drove us to the motel, showed us where to get BBQ, resupply, to our charming room, and wash our clothes. We are delighted we chose Bear Mountain Bridge Motel! We enjoyed yummy BBQ for supper at Swamp Irish's request!!! Go figure!

Guess who was staying at the motel.. Bear Claw and Appalachian Al! What are the chances, we giggled.

We resupplied, ate a yummy breakfast, packed our treasures, and wondered how we were to return to the trail.

Grandpa was waiting outside for us with a smile on his face and asked if we were ready to go. ‘Check for your belongings!’ We gathered for pictures with Bear Claw and Appalachian Al and climbed into the SUV, giggling as we mentioned this would be the easiest climb of the day. Grandpa drove us to the post office where Anthony gave us our mail drop package (Thanks, Anthony!), then to the trail. We said goodbye to Bear Claw and Appalachian Al.

The day’s trek consisted of tightrope ridges covered with colorful yellow and red leaves, lots of flows (ups and downs), some rocks, a few boulders, boardwalks, and Pig, a southbound hiker. The last was easy trekking. Maybe that was because all we could think about was stopping for food at the Appalachian Market, and it was worth every step. The food was delicious, and everyone at the store was a pleasure to talk to! We gathered extra food and off we trekked to Franciscan Way to camp for the night. Shortly after we stepped back onto the trail, we received the most amazing surprise of the day...a metal Appalachian Trail survey marker lay at our feet in all its glory! We danced around the marker, took pictures, and giggled before going our merry way!

Soon after setting up our tent townhouse, other hikers began to arrive for the night. Tumbleweed, Swat, and Armadillo (southbound hikers) were the first to arrive. As hikers arrived, information about the water source and shower was shared. Hikers continued to wander in until well after dark. Everyone stopped to chat about their day’s adventure and the upcoming terrain. Giggling would begin when hikers would meet a fellow hiker they had met up with from time to time on the trail.

We opened our monthly mail drop package filled with treasures!

We get to eat real breakfast tomorrow: grits. We took an outside shower at the ballfield and used our wipes as wash clothes. We’re so clean. We brushed our teeth with toothpaste, always a plus. We split up and repackaged everything. The best treasure we received was the sleeping bag liner! No more re-adjusting all night long. Swamp Irish claimed first dibs on it because it was larger and new. LOLFOF

The Franciscan Way Tent Site was a quiet place to camp. Hikers broke camp, leaving one after the other, telling each other to enjoy their hike today. It was a cool morning but we all knew it would be getting hot soon, even with the rains coming.

Today’s trek was filled with a few rock fields. We felt as though we were on a StairMaster, stepping up a mountain. The terrain was filled with dirt paths and surprise rocks scattered here and there. One way or another, they’re going to get you.

The Appalachian Trail entertained us with deer, hightailing it. So that’s where the expression comes from…because their tails stood straight up as they ran away. Chipmunks scampered in the woods over turtle rocks. In the distance we knew there was civilization by the sound of chickens clucking proudly over the eggs they just laid. This sparked the saying from the book Henny Penny. As we went along, and went along, and went along, we met southbounders. We met Ace and Gen (Generator, who wore a knee brace. Everyone on the trail watched for her to make sure she was safe, and the other hikers would pass the word down the trail.). We also met Stokes and Tumble, section hikers celebrating their 30th Anniversary.

Arriving at Dennytown Road, we found a spigot water source on the side of a Waterhouse, so we took advantage of it. Many times, water is shut off because of COVID-19. We scratch our heads wondering, Why? Today, the Dennytown Road water was an excellent source: delicious, cool, and refreshing.

Across the road was a 1/2 sign, past the gate was a beautiful open field waiting for us to embrace its welcoming arms. The campground was as refreshing as the water! Three section hikers had already set up camp. Kimi and Heiton (hiking on their honeymoon because COVID-19 had canceled their original plans) and Joce, all Trail Angel nurses who came to our aid and ordered food to be delivered for us to eat. Yummy Lasagna! We swapped valuable medical knowledge and water source knowledge which made us giggle.

Juice wandered into camp shortly after us. Once again, everyone shared water source knowledge.

All hung bear bags because we saw a Sasquatch caution sign as we hiked the trail. We also cleaned the trash scattered by night creatures from the Labor Day weekend campers and enjoyed the port-a-potties (Nice!). After discussing the weather, we all changed our plans to be out of the tent site by 5 a.m. to avoid the rainstorms coming through in the morning.

Our warm, cozy sleeping bags gave us a feeling of comfort from the cool air outside as we thanked Mrs. K for her assistance back home, sang Happy Birthday to Ms. V, giggled, and drifted off to sleep in the safety of the Appalachian Trail and the Trail Angels it provides!!!","Tent Site at Franciscan Way Mile Marker 1413, New York

‘Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head’ Just as predicted, the rain started shortly after 5 a.m. as we left Dennytown Campsite. The rains continued off and on all day, stopping briefly for us to come across a cairn roundabout in the middle of the trail. Oh My Goodness! Bet you didn’t know that there are Leaf Fairies in New York! Leaf Fairies are different from all other fairies with wings of vivid, fall leaf colors. We circled the cairn this morning when out of the corner of our eye we noticed something magical crowning the cairn, a 400 fashioned from leaves. We giggled, took a picture as the bright orange newts danced around the cairn, and trekked on, celebrating this special occasion! Rock Fairies from New Jersey must have passed the word to the Leaf Fairies in New York that we would be celebrating 400 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail, so they sweetly left us a spectacular crowning marker! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with an easy terrain of trekking on breathtaking views of dirt-covered stone ridges around the mountain.

The cool rains continued to fall. Soon, water flowed through the path like mini bayous in Louisiana after a summer evening rain shower.

We stomped through the flowing water as if we were little kids playing in the mud puddles, giggling. After all, there was no way to dodge the rushing water.

A U.S. Geodetic Survey Marker, an American flag painted on a boulder in memory of 911, breathtaking views, slippery boardwalks, flat stone walkways, and orange mushroom flowers led to Ralph’s Peak Hiker Cabin Shelter.

The rains ended before arriving at the shelter. Our feet were wet, our clothes were wet, our tent was wet! The tent was in the bottom of the pack, and when unzipped, water poured out onto our feet. We giggled and set it up to dry. Everything in the compactor bags were dry. We took a wet wipe bath as usual, changed into dry clothes, pulled the pads from our hiking shoes to dry, hung all wet items to dry on the shelter’s clothesline, and cooked a supper of red mashed potatoes, bacon bits, and dried onion soup mix. The shelter had all the comforts of home, complete with privy and water. We thank the Trail Angels who had left bottled water and snacks. There was a hand pump well, which flowed nicely when pumped.

I think we have lost a few pounds...more like 50 between the 2 of us. Went to the closet and found nothing that fits. Guess it’s off to go shopping...Bomp…Wrong Answer! As I shook my head, our sweet granddaughter walked out of her room and handed us the smallest (for Sugar Gal) and largest (for Swamp Irish) clothes she owned. We giggled because they FIT!!!

Our sweet daughter-in-law ordered smaller hiking clothes before we returned. We are all set to enjoy our journey on the Appalachian Trail in clothes that fit!

We prefer clothes that are comfortable, dry quickly, and are sticker bush proof...they do not hang onto the fabric. We wear Habit brand shirts. Swamp Irish prefers Magellan brand fishing pants that may be unzipped for shorts. Sugar Gal prefers men’s Clothin brand black (don’t show dirt) travel pants (1 pair she made into capris). The pockets are larger than in women’s pants, so she may place her phone in the left bottom zip pocket for easy access to take pictures of mushrooms, flowers, wildlife, etc. at a moment’s notice.

You can never have too many shoes!

As every hiker knows, the most important thing on the trail is proper foot attire! The most important question is what is the best shoe? Hum...Tough Question! You wear what is the most comfortable for you.

We hiked. We changed sock brands. (Currently wearing Injinji toe socks and Darn Tough socks.)

We hiked. We changed insoles brands. (Swamp Irish is currently wearing Superfeet Sugar Gal is currently wearing Airplus.)

We hiked. We changed hiking shoe brands. (Swamp Irish is currently wearing Keen Sugar Gal is currently wearing Oboz.)

Who knows, we may change again.

The Appalachian Trail is tough on your feet, so you will go through several pairs of hiking shoes. It is okay if after your first 100 miles you change all of your foot wear. Just giggle, give in, and go to the nearest outdoor store to buy another pair. A word to the wise, make sure they are at least 2 sizes bigger (if you wear an 8 ½, buy a 10) this is so you can wear 2 pairs of socks for extra comfort and because hiking shoes are made to fit tight and this will help eliminate those pesky blisters. 
After hiking all day, upon arriving at camp, give your feet a rest by changing into camp shoes (Crocs, sandals, etc). Take a moment to massage your feet. It only takes 5 seconds to make your feet happy!

After hiking over 300 miles on the Appalachian Trail, we discovered everyone’s feet hurt, not just ours. So, take excellent care of your feet, giggle, and trek on! Enjoy your journey on the Appalachian Trail!!","Home

There are many options for housing on the Appalachian Trail.

Shelters are awesome when the weather is bad or you don’t want to carry a tent. Many shelters were closed due to COVID-19 this year. What a bummer! Some shelters are open now. Fellow hikers’ concerns were snoring, mosquitoes, and mice.

Hammocks are nice. We talked to fellow hikers who loved their hammocks! Their only concern was bad weather, finding trees, and freezing temperatures.

Carrying a tent was the option we chose for privacy. Tents come in all shapes, sizes, and weights. We are happy with our Marmot 3P Tungsten.

There are many things your Mother taught you not to do.

Take candy and any other food from a stranger. You are hungry!Get in a car with a stranger. Sure beats walking!

The Appalachian Trail has beckoned us to its beauty in Harper’s Ferry, WV, where we began our journey a couple of months ago. The northern part of the trail is getting cold and parts will be closing soon, so we have opted to flip-flop from New York going north to West Virginia going south. We started out as northbound thru-hikers. That didn’t work out. Instead of a flip-flopper, a fellow hiker once called it a Yo-Yo for those of us caught in the Covid-19 hiking confusion while trying desperately to trek the Appalachian Trail this year. We giggle at the thought of having no idea what we are...flip-floppers…Yo-Yoers…hikers!?!?!

We flew into Dulles, Ubered to Harper’s Ferry, ate a yummy lunch, and hiked an easy trek to Weverton Road. The trail was filled with day hikers sharing this lovely day with their families as they trekked along the breathtaking, roaring Potomac River.

At day’s ended, we took a moment to enjoy ice cream then we snuggled into a comfy bed and giggled, for we had answered the beckoning call to return to the Appalachian Trail!!","Weverton Parking Lot Mile Marker 1029.6, Maryland Slept In: Hotel

We began our first full day back on the Appalachian Trail on this cool, crisp morning, by crossing the Shenandoah Bridge. What a rush it gave us...the rush of excitement returning to the trail, the rushing river below us, and the rushing cars beside us as people hurried off to work. Trekking onward into the wilderness was an easy hike until we crossed into Virginia. We looked around, scratched our heads, and noticed there was no longer a rock wall along side of the trail. All the sharp rocks were on the trail, making it difficult to walk quickly. Trekking at a snail’s pace allowed Sugar Gal to pause from time to time to take pictures of the dainty wildflowers, colorful mushrooms, and broken Mason jars along the trail. Broken Mason Jars!?!?! We giggled, thinking there must be moonshine in them there hills! Swamp Irish was keeping a watchful eye out for moonshiners and their stills, hoping to partake in their treasures. We giggled and trekked on.

Surprisingly, there were many day, section, and thru-hikers on the trail.

We stopped to chat (swapping adventures and information about the upcoming trail) with section hikers Nooga (like Chattanooga) who was headed home today, Sits a Lot, Q, Doppler, X-ray, and Richard, who we met earlier at Wawayanda Shelter in New Jersey.

The Appalachian Trail spreads kindness by sending special hikers into your adventure. Today it would be Brad! We met this young man, now known as Tree Beard, when we began our journey on the Appalachian Trail. He greeted us with a smile and a simple “Hi!” then trekked by quickly, came to a screeching halt, turned around, and shouted, “Swamp Irish and Sugar Gal!” We giggled and shared trail adventures. He has hiked to Katahdin and started back down south to Springer Mountain. We were both headed to David Lesser Shelter — us for the evening and him to refresh his water supply. We all trekked on. He left as quickly as he had come. Upon arriving at the shelter, we set up camp for the evening. As we gathered our water gear to trek to the nearby spring, a familiar voice yelled, “I’m glad I didn’t miss Ya’ll!” Today, Tree Beard was our Trail Angel, bearing Trail Magic of the most prized possession a hiker could hope for...cold water from a spring. We replenished our water supply, giggled with excitement for seeing each other once again, and said our goodbyes, wishing each other a pleasant trek.

We have returned to the trail with warmer gear, so we snuggled into our Enlightened quilts, giggled reminiscing of Tree Beard’s smiling face, and drifted into a sweet slumber for the Appalachian Trail had once again shared its kindness!!","Shenandoah Bridge Harper’s Ferry Mile Marker 1025.2, West Virginia

To keep us from getting bored, the Appalachian Trail was filled with different types of terrain: gentle slopes of ups and downs, level terrain, small boulder fields, a few rocky paths, and those dreadful pointed rocks to remind you of Pennsylvania. So let’s classify the day as a moderate hiking day.

Shortly after starting our trek, we met Madame Sits a Lot on this cool morning. She invited us to camp where she lives when we arrived at her dwelling about 100 miles up the Appalachian Trail. Her knowledge was abundant with useful information to be used as we trekked the trail. We giggled, said our goodbyes, and trekked onward.

From time to time, we enjoyed the company of section hikers: I Don’t Actually Have One, Mission, Baby Catcher, and others who were headed northbound.

Our goal today was to stay at Bear Den, but opted for Communications Tower Tent Site, which was much closer. It was a beautiful little site, secluded from the rest of the world. As we climbed into our townhouse tent, it began to rain, and we giggled. We snuggled into the arms of the Appalachian Trail as gentle raindrops, dancing on the roof, sang us to sleep!!","David Lesser Shelter, Virginia

Let’s go to the Appalachian Trail theme park and hike the Roller Coaster hills/mountains! The terrain was filled with thrilling ups, downs, zig zags, and pointy rocks.

The Raven Rock Overlook was a frightening foggy area filled with day hikers, sitting on boulders, and gazing at the eerie white nothingness. Now this made us giggle as we watched with amazement! The hikers gathered and stared, as if in a scary movie who were called to the eerie white nothingness. We trekked on. The fog lifted as the day wore on.

“The hills are alive with”...day hikers who were sweet smelling, chatting, giggling, running after their children, walking their dogs, carrying their dogs, trekking in birthday groups and scout groups, and would come to a screeching halt to put their masks on all because of the stinky thru-hikers. We enjoyed stepping to the side to let them pass by (giving us a break), talking, and giggling with them.

We did have a strange encounter with a hiker who often camped for several days at a time. When asked if he was a thru-hiker he replied, “NO! Thru-hiking is illegal!” At that moment Sugar Gal, being the sweet southern lady she is, raised her right eyebrow, smiled and nodded replying, “Sweetie! I’m Illegal!”, and trekked onward. Now, every southerner knows if “Sweetie” is used in that tone, then you must be a total idiot!!! Obviously, he did not realize she was hungry, tired, had aching feet, and was gripping two very sharp long trekking poles that could take him down at a moment’s notice.

We met very nice section hikers, swapping trail information with them such as the nearest water source. A few were Joey, Eric, Do Not, Mya, Holy Jeans, Brad (like the tack), and many more. With their invaluable knowledge, we were able to trek to Sam Moore Shelter for the night.

As evening grew near, we set up camp, ate a yummy supper, hung our food bags on the bear pole provided, climbed into our warm cozy sleeping quilts, and giggled at the amazing day the Appalachian Trail had provided on this Roller Coaster Adventure!!","Tentsite Mile Marker 1009.1Virginia

Let’s take a wild ride on the tail end of the Appalachian Trail Roller Coaster!

The trek was filled with mountains going up and down all day, beautiful mushrooms, refreshing cool streams, and occasional foot bridges. Some of the mountains were loaded with rocks similar to the ones we found in New York, making the roller coaster a normal day’s trek. We scratched our heads and giggled, thinking the warning signs were for day hikers.

Speaking of day hikers, we met several who kept telling us about the peaceful meadow and beautiful waterfall. All day we searched and searched. Finally a thru-hiker informed us that the meadow was through the small opening in the trees with tall grass and the waterfall was the stream with rushing water flowing over rocks dropping about a foot to the pooling water below. We giggled and trekked on.

The trail had several thru-hikers and section hikers who stopped to chat and giggle about their adventures on the trail, swapping information. We encountered Lady Slipper and Wander Lost, Teen Wolf and Fox, and Chicken John, all southbounders. We also met Camo and Grandpa Looney, section hikers.

There are many runners on the Appalachian Trail. We met a delightful runner, Iris, interested in hiking the Appalachian Trail and wanted to give us trail magic near her home when we reached that area. Iris then disappeared as quickly as she had appeared.

We arrived early at the shelter to set up camp, hoping not to hear wild animals during the night like the night before. Swamp Irish prepared a yummy meal of mashed potatoes with a chopped cheese stick & bacon bits. We giggled when the cicadas began to sing, snuggled in our cozy sleeping quilts, and drifted into a peaceful slumber.

After a peaceful night’s sleep, we woke up earlier than usual this morning to begin our trek. There are usually many creatures of the night making sounds you have never heard before, including howling coyotes. We giggle often, thinking we have heard Darrell, the Sasquatch! We feel safe in our townhouse tent with the door zipped shut, but last night was peaceful.

Upon leaving, we said goodbye to Kevin, a section hiker using the shelter, who shared information about the upcoming trail. (Hummm…no door on the shelters!)

There was no water at the shelter, so we resupplied at the babbling “Brook” down the side trail a little more than a mile from Rod Hollow Shelter. As we approached the brook, we met three hikers, Digger, Rock & Roll, and Darkest Hour, in need of water. We shared the source that had been shared with us by Lucky Charms. They in turn, shared upcoming water sources and campsites with us. That is what’s so spectacular about the Appalachian Trail, everyone looks after each other’s needs.

Today’s adventure was an easy trek. We sang and giggled as we trekked the easy trail on level terrain with few rocks. Every once in a while, the Appalachian Trail gives your feet a rest, which was today for us. This gave us extra energy, so we did a little trail maintenance by knocking small branches off the trail with our trekking poles.

The trail graced us with colorful mushrooms and meadows of flowers. Yes, we finally found a meadow! There were blackbirds bathing in a stream, and when the huge flock flew away, they sounded like a helicopter flying overhead. We came across ants with wings ready to take flight and a snake slithering across the trail. There were many different kinds of fuzzy worms on the trail. We saw pale green worms, black shiny worms, and black and orange worms that reminded us of Halloween Oreos. We were hungry, and that thought made us giggle.

To top things off, the Appalachian Trail sent us a pleasant cool breeze from time to time.

Upon arriving at the new Whiskey Hollow Shelter, we met a Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC) Trail Angel, Angela, who makes sure this area of the Appalachian Trail is well managed. We thanked her for all of her hard work, making our adventure safe. As evening fell, we sat on the front porch searching for fall colors in the surrounding trees, admiring nature at its finest, and giggled at the fact that we were part of the majestic Appalachian Trail!!!","Rod Hollow Shelter, Virginia

(For anyone following our journey who is wondering when we would be uploading more entries, WiFi is not always reliable, so we are catching up now.)

Don’t you just love it when everything goes as planned? We referred to the AT Guide Book, Guthooks, and the weather reports to discover it was the perfect day to hike 10 miles. Easy trekking with a level trail and manageable elevation. Yes, we’ve got this!!!

After a big breakfast and feeling rather energetic, Sugar Gal giggled, deciding to take the lead... hiccup #1. There are spider webs out here! Swamp Irish laughed, informing her of his solution: spider fighter trekking poles. So up went her trekking poles. Onward we trekked and all were tickled pink when we met up with Mesquite (section hiker) going north...no more spider webs!

The trail had a slippery rock field causing us to come to a screeching halt...hiccup #2. This was not in the manual! Time to go slow, trusting our shoes and trekking poles.

The air became cool, then cold, then rainy...hiccup #3. Quickly throw on your backpack rain cover! Forget the pack, put on your rain jacket!

Ahhhhhh the rain stopped. We met A Week and R2 (northbound section hikers). We also met Shoe Bone (southbound thru-hiker) who informed us of thunder storms starting at 6 p.m.... hiccup #4. Stop chatting and giggling…it’s time to “Move it Toots!”

Vibrant colorful autumn leaves began falling, decorating the trail. When we arrived at the shelter, it looked like something out of a magazine: an inviting resort in the fall. Yay! We trekked 10 miles!!!!

After a delicious meal, an executive decision was made to stay in the shelter due to the incoming storm. That was the wisest decision we had made all day! At 6:05 p.m., the bottom fell out of the sky.

Books, a southbound thru-hiker, came in out of the icy cold weather to join us in the shelter.

It rained heavily until midnight, then the wind began to howl. About 4:00 a.m., we were awakened to the sound of a loud crackle followed by a ferocious thump of a falling tree nearby! There was gasp by all in the shelter!

After a couple of minutes, we giggled, saying we had made wise decisions by staying in the shelter where it was safe, cozy, warm, and dry. We rolled over, drifted off to sleep, and awakened to a sunny, chilly day on the Appalachian Trail!","Whiskey Hollow Shelter, Virginia

The Appalachian Trail spoiled us with another cool day of easy trekking filled with gentle slopes, manageable rocks, trails sprinkled with colorful fall leaves, beautiful flowers, and fancy mushrooms!

Knowing we would have a short trek to our destination, we took time along the way to chat and giggle with fellow hikers (Robert, Heels & Coach (often referred to as Dumb & Dumber)). Our trek for the day ended as the Appalachian Trail honored us with a hike along the grounds of the Smithsonian Refuge for Endangered Species.

Let’s stay in Mountain Home B&B/Hostel and “Cabbin,” a charming old home bought in 2012 and renovated from great despair to the beautiful home and grounds it is today by thru-hiker Scott “Possible” and Lisa Jenkins. Lisa greeted us with smiles and refreshing lemonade. Treating us like royalty, she took time out of her busy schedule to chat and giggle with us. Their sweet hospitality did not stop there. We were given a tour of the house, shown where we could indulge in tea and coffee, pamper ourselves with a hot bath, and change into clothes provided by them while they washed our stinky hiker clothes! Lisa drove us into Front Royal (a nearby town) where we ate the most amazing crab cakes, enjoyed ice cream in the park, resupplied, and picked up yummy Asian food. Upon arriving back at the hostel, Scott returned our clean clothes. Sweet!!!

The next morning, Scott & Lisa served the most amazing breakfast cooked for a king (& queen) while sharing the history of the house and surrounding grounds. To help us save time on the trail, they gave us hiking forms to fill out for the Shenandoah National Park,. We gave each other air hugs and trekked on our merry way to explore more adventures on the Appalachian Trail!

Mission and Chap (section hikers) let us know about a fairly good hike in store for us on this chilly day. We saw and congratulated Juice (thru-hiker), who remembered us from New York. Juice had made it to Katahdin! Yay!

We began an easy trek along the Smithsonian Refuge for Endangered Species when the Appalachian Trail graced us with trail magic! Oh wait, that isn’t magic! Why, that’s the lunch of a hiker who whizzed by us a few minutes ago! We giggled because we were going to be Trail Angels, returning his valued food. ‘Let’s catch up with him so he doesn’t go hungry!!’ This made us hike faster! The terrain changed to steep and rocky with small rock fields. We stopped only for a moment to chat with Dutch Bliss & Akeelis Keel (section hikers) then continue on our quest. After huffing and puffing then playing hopscotch by jumping over the rocks and streams, we gave up. We stopped for lunch at Tom Floyd Wayside Shelter. Upon arriving, there were fellow hikers, The Sisters (Turtle and Rock), already enjoying lunch. One hiker, Dave, wasn’t eating. We pulled out his lunch. Everyone giggled! He was so thankful that the Appalachian Trail had Trail Angels watching over him! After all the Trail Angels who have helped us, we got to be Trail Angels!

They told us about the upcoming Shenandoah campgrounds that for a fee of $15, included showers. SHOWERS!!! We’re sold on that idea!

Down the trail, we had a “Whoohoo! Amen! Alleluia!” moment when we entered the Shenandoah to register by depositing our hiking forms!! Onward we trekked, dancing and giggling that we reached this memorable milestone on the Appalachian Trail!

We learned something new today on the Appalachian Trail! Horses can read! There was a sign that said “No horses beyond this point” and there were none! However, as we trekked we saw other wildlife (squirrels enjoying nuts) and foliage (various mushrooms and beautiful flowers) that lined the trail.

We came across a tent site that was the perfect place to stop for the evening. We set up camp, ate a yummy supper, and hung our bear bags. Then, out of the blue a deer wandered down the path toward our townhouse tent. She glanced up at us as if to say, “Hurry, take my picture!” So, we did! Then she continued grazing and prancing, slowly leaving the area. It began to rain shortly after we climbed into our cozy sleeping bags.

How sweet it is that we never get tired of hiking the Appalachian Trail! On this cold crisp morning, we woke up early to hike to another tent site, about 10 miles down the trail. The terrain was not too bad as we trekked the rocky ridge of the mountains. Swamp Irish mentioned he felt like a mountain goat going down the mountain, walking the rocky ridge. There were breathtaking overviews to the valley below worthy of pausing a moment to take a picture. Water was everywhere because it rained last night making it easy to replenish our water supply as needed.

We stopped now and then to giggle and chat, gathering information about the upcoming terrain from Singing Hawk (a northbound hiker), Papa Smurf (a section hiker), and lots of day and weekend hikers. All hikers seemed to be enjoying the beautiful day.

Sugar Gal tripped on a rock, busting her leg and head. Swamp Irish rushed to her aid, cheering her up as he checked for broken bones & bleeding injuries. Nope! You’ll live! We giggled and trekked onward!

The rest of the day was nice trekking, with a few steep climbs. The tent site in Guthooks was nowhere to be found, so we hiked another two miles. Ahh…a perfect site was found!

Once there, we met southbound thru-hikers Light Show, Patrick, and Ace who informed us that this particular Wayside did not serve breakfast...just our luck. We giggled and decided to have an early lunch. We enjoyed grilled sandwiches, then off we trekked.

The terrain was steep and rocky at times, with colorful LSU purple and gold flowers lining the trail. That was perfect since it’s football season...Geaux Tigers!!! Every so often, we came across chipmunk holes, squirrel nests, and mole tunnels next to the trail. We were able to chat and giggle with several day hikers who had jingle bells attached to their belts. Hummm, did we miss something while on the Appalachian Trail...is it Christmas? No! They do not want to lose each other. Awesome idea!! Sugar Gal, hook up your sleigh bells!
We were also able to chat with thru-hikers Kakes and Snow White.

We trekked on to Pass Mountain Hut where we met up with Snow White again. The hut was filled with giggling hikers settling in for the night. Could it have been the wine!?!?

We woke up to a cool day of hiking. The Appalachian Trail terrain was very versatile with lots of narrow ridges, a few rock fields to climb, and gentle ups and downs. Trekking poles were definitely needed. The pathway was sprinkled with tiny pink flowers, chipmunks and squirrels scampering around, and many fuzzy worms taking their sweet time to cross the trail.

The trail was filled with hikers. Along the way, we met #2 (we named his friend #1), Cinderfella, and Young.

Young, a Trail Angel, shared ramen noodles and bread with us so we could make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch. Now this was not just any hiker! Young’was not young, but he was married the same year and month as we were, and his first two children were born the same years and months as our first two children were born. We giggled at the coincidences, enjoyed lunch, and trekked on.

Due to the rain last night, it was chilly and a little foggy this morning.

The terrain was extremely rocky as we made our way to Skyland Resort for breakfast. To make the trek confusing, the trail detoured us to a route that was not listed in our Guthooks and the fog got thicker. We missed breakfast at the resort so we enjoyed a danish and hot chocolate with Mushroom and Tortoise (thru-hikers). The staff at the resort was very kind by pointing us in the right direction back to the Appalachian Trail. From the moment we walked outside to the time we put on our backpacks, suddenly the fog blew out to reveal a beautiful sunny day. We giggled and trekked on.

During our trek, we enjoyed lovely views of the mountains and the town of Luray in the valleys below.

Hopping over rocks on the cliff’s edge was not as easy as the wildlife made it look. As we came to a little spring, a squirrel and chipmunk having lunch scampered in different directions off of a log, leaving behind a message for us. 500 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced over the log taking pictures! NUTS!! Wait a minute...Does this make them nut fairies?!?!?

Leaf Fairies from New York must have passed the word to the Nut Fairies in Virginia that we would be celebrating 500 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail, so they sweetly left us a spectacularly, nutty message! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with an easy terrain of trekking over refreshing, tiny waterfalls along the mountain path.

Knowing we had trekked 500 miles inspired us to happily continue to Rock Spring Hut. There was a breathtaking view of the valley below and the piped spring flowed ice cold water to refresh our supply. Hikers trickled in before nightfall and the camp was quickly filled with giggling hiker stories. Just as we were climbing into our tent, we noticed the valley was brimming with sparkling white lights. It looked like Christmas time.

“Hi Ho! Hi Ho! It’s off to Big Meadows we go!” There’s nothing that warms the cockles of your heart like knowing you are going to take a hot shower and put on clean clothes. Today it would be at Big Meadows Campground!

Our trek to the campground was a little rocky, but who cares when all you can think about is food, showers, and clean clothes. The rangers were so nice. They placed us near the facilities and gave us a senior discount. The hiker stink was gone in record time so we could enjoy a hot meal at the lodge. The waitress asked if we wanted dessert. We giggled saying at the same time, “What do you have?” It was a unanimous decision...Blackberry Cobbler with Blackberry Ice Cream! Yummy!!!

With full bellies, we hiked back to the campground from the lodge, giggling and chatting with the campers. As evening fell, the wind picked up with gusts of up to 30 mph and the temperature dropped into the 30s. We have never seen so much wood being bought at a campground. Everyone stayed warm in front of their cozy fires. Deer wandered into the campground grazing on the green grass, stopping so campers could take their pictures.

The weather has been cold at night, in the high 30s, with windy gusts of up to 30 mph. Our tent townhouse held up to the strong winds very well!

We decided to make sure nothing is broken from Sugar Gal’s fall, so it’s off to see a doctor in Luray. We have seen the quaint little town of Luray from the mountain tops for the past week and now get to see it up close.

Tim, with Skyline Shenandoah Shuttle, gave us the tour of the area while shuttling us from the campground into town. He entertained us, keeping us giggling with his stories of his cats and his one chicken. He was awesome and we highly recommend him! (If you’re in the area, he can be reached at 484-390-4834, text only.)

Tim brought us to the doctor’s office. The doctor’s office sent us to the emergency room because Sugar Gal’s eye and leg looked too bad for them to treat. No breaks or brain damage! Yay!!! Everyone who saw the wounds said, “Oooh! That is horrible!” Hikers are tough cookies! Speaking of cookies, let’s hike to the nearby shopping center to resupply.

Forget hiking when Trail Angel David’s kindness will drive us to the shopping center to resupply and eat. His son was being treated at the hospital by the nicest hospital staff. Thanks David!

We ate delicious food at an Italian restaurant: yummy lasagna, steak on French bread with onions and peppers, and French fries.

Swamp Irish got a haircut by the owner, who wanted to visit a New Orleans Voodoo Queen. We all giggled!

After resupplying, Tim returned us safe and sound back to the campground. Thanks Tim!

What a beautiful, windy, sunny morning to hike the Appalachian Trail! There are happy day hikers everywhere. Shortly after leaving the campgrounds, we came across a graveyard. A bit of Trivia...Big Meadows was not named after the big meadow in the park, but for the Meadows family.

The terrain is so nice today, with easygoing, gentle slopes of ups and downs with few rocks. Oh no, we spoke too soon!! The good trail ended after 5 1/2 miles, then to a steep path filled with cement type rocks scattered on the trail until we arrived at the Bearfence Hut blue blaze trail. Yikes! My feet hurt!! The Appalachian Trail has a way of taking your mind off of painful rocks by distracting you with windmill cookies at lunch; scampering chipmunks; fuzzy Halloween Oreo cookie worms; lovely purple, pink, yellow, and white flowers; leaves that have drifted to the ground covering the trail with their vibrant colors; and mushrooms hiding in the foliage, peeking out from time to time.

We met and gathered information from fellow hikers like Daddoo (section hiker) and Lost (northbound thru-hiker) who had been kicked off the trail due to Covid-19 because of his home zip code. He is very happy to have been able to return to the trail!

Upon arriving at Bearfence Hut, we also met Hot Cross Buns and Free Bird, both hiking the Shenandoahs.

The day’s terrain was good, with an easy trek the first 4 miles, then rocky for 2 miles, then easy to the tent site at mile marker 912.3 near Saddleback Mountain Trail.

The morning trail took us to Lewis Mountain Campground where we stopped for some delectable bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits from the cooler section of the camp store. The store employee had thawed the biscuits, so all we needed to do was microwave our yummy breakfast. Before checking out, we spotted some sweet Moon Pies, so we couldn’t leave without those. We enjoyed our biscuits in a picturesque part of the park. The shy and humble gentleman who checked out our groceries came outside to chat. That’s when we discovered he was the famous thru-hiker in the area, Caboose! Swamp Irish mentioned he was having an issue with his backpack. Caboose took time from his busy schedule to help find a solution. Together, they adjusted, loosened, and tightened straps until the backpack fit perfectly. After hiking 500 miles, the backpack finally felt great! Caboose is truly a Trail Angel!! We giggled, waved goodbye, and trekked on!

The following should be censored!!

Holy C***! Bird (sh**) ca-ca splashed onto Sugar Gal’s phone when she paused to take a picture of a mushroom. Sugar Gal did not giggle, but Swamp Irish laughed his fool (a**) head off! Oh wait... we can’t put that in print!!! Good thing she had paused, because it would have landed all over her beautiful, smelly, dirty, smashed hair. There aren’t enough sweet smelling wipes in the world to clean the white stuff off of the phone. Oh well, the Appalachian Trail just created another unforgettable moment!

We trekked on, doing a little rock climbing, stopping to enjoy our delicious Moon Pieand taking pictures of the foliage along the path.

We decided to eat supper in South River Picnic Area, a nice little park next to the trail with picnic tables. There we met White Lightening (a section hiker) who was very knowledgeable about the area, informing us of the easy trekking to the tent site where we would be staying tonight.

The tent site was very level with few rocks, so we hung bear bags in the nearby trees, set up our tent townhouse, and snuggled into our cozy sleeping quilts.

Two cicadas chatted with each other as the wind howled all night. Runners and hikers could be heard trekking the trail until the wee hours of the morning. We giggled with our earplugs in place, a snug fitting backpack, and a clean phone to journal our unbelievable Appalachian Trail adventures!!","Bearfence Hut, Virginia

Hoping to go into town at Swift Run Gap, we started hiking early. The terrain was mild ups and downs, with scattered rocks on the trail to keep it from washing out. Don’t you just hate those dingy rocks!!! Hold tight to your trekking poles, we’re going down!

We trekked between a mountain range on one side of the trail and a road on the other side. Hum...I think hiking the road would be easier. LOL! Beautiful yellow leaves are falling, carpeting the path, while huge pointy rock formations accent the mountain sides.

When we arrived at Swift Run Gap, we discovered there were no hotels available because it was the long Columbus Day weekend. Just our luck! We thanked the shuttle services, Bill and Scott, who tried to help us in our hotel hunt. We continued our trek to Hightop Hut, pausing to see the lovely views the Appalachian Trail wanted us to enjoy.

About 1/2 mile from the hut, we found an icy cold piped water spring next to the trail, making it easy to replenish our water supply.

Upon arriving, we opted to stay in the hut because it was to be a rainy night. Hikers drifted in by the droves for the rest of the evening. Sobiz and Generator, a hiker we had met earlier on the trail, were the last to arrive.

A total of 19 happy hikers stayed at Hightop Hut, dodging the rain, sharing cuisine secrets that every hiker should know, and giggling at each other’s funny hiking adventures on the Appalachian Trail!","Tent Site 912.3

There is nothing like listening to the relaxing pitter patter of raindrops falling onto the rooftop at Hightop Hut. So here we are, watching the rainfall with Jiffy Pop (section northbound hiker who came in from the rain) chatting, giggling, and sipping hot apple cider and high mountain oolong tea from Taiwan.

The wind howled as Hurricane Delta dumped several inches of rain during the night. By morning, all that was left was a chilly, drizzling rain. We rose early, ate a hot breakfast, packed up, giggled, said our goodbyes to Jiffy Pop, and were on our way.

The Appalachian Trail gifted us with easy terrain and trekking with only one steep mountain to climb. Drizzling rain continued to fall all day, and colorful autumn leaves carpeted the Appalachian Trail floor. Leaves, rocks, roots, and mud are all slippery when wet. We found water everywhere, making it easy to replenish our water bottles from the rushing streams as needed. The flowers are starting to wither from the cool fall air. The trees are becoming barren as the vivid colorful leaves fall to the ground from the strong winds. The chirping bugs at night are becoming quieter; no more earplugs. There is a chill in the air, so we wear our puffy jackets as we begin our hikes in the morning. Fall is Here!

We met several thru-hikers who shared weather and trail information. The first thru-hiker we met, on his 16th day of retirement and 16th day of hiking the trail, passed us with a full pack. Another passed us slack packing. Hummmm! We scratched our heads and giggled. Then there were Granger & Slider (northbound) and Lean Beef & Scratch (southbound). There were day hikers who had asked if we had seen Elliott? We replied, “No” and trekked on. Low and behold, 5 minutes later we saw Elliott, letting him know that his friends were waiting for him at the car. He was delighted. We giggled, trekking on, knowing that everyone watches over each other on the Appalachian Trail. Upon arriving at the Pinefield Hut, we met two young ladies hiking the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. When asked if they had trail names they replied no, but maybe they should be named 2 Sisters and their Annoying Dogs. We giggled, parting ways to set up for the night.

We opted to stay in the shelter for the night because of the rainy weather which was making the ground wet and muddy. Yes indeedy, Hurricane Delta is lingering on! Bunkering down for the night in our cozy sleeping quilts, we giggled knowing the Appalachian Trail would lead us to Loft Mountain Campground tomorrow where we could shower and wash our stinky hiker clothes!!","

Awakened by the nearby stream, rushing from all the rains that had fallen during the night, we giggled knowing there will be no shortage of water today!

Up and at ‘em, Swamp Irish! The rains ended from Hurricane Delta about 4 a.m. and the stars are shining, twinkling their Morse Code message that the Appalachian Trail is ready for us to hike a beautiful day!

We packed up our damp clothes and began trekking in a light fog. A cool breeze began to blow, and the sunlight peeked through giving us warmth.

We finally got to see the breathtaking Shenandoah Mountains...and all we see are dead trees and fog. Man Oh Man! This Sucks!!!!

The rushing streams were very tranquil until we had to walk through them, getting our feet wet because there were no giant stepping stones to dance upon for crossing.

Then, magically the terrain dropped in elevation. There were streams everywhere, rushing through the mountains. The trees, flowers, and mushrooms came alive with color, displaying the magnificent splendor of the Shenandoah Mountains as we walk on the ridge! Ahh, a breathtaking moment!!

Food! Trekking to the Wayside, we discovered that they did not have hot food, so we checked out the Loft Mountain Campground store. There, we enjoyed hot sandwiches and cold drinks. We checked in at the Loft Mountain Campground registration office only to discover there were no campsites available; however, a camper left early with specific instructions that his site be given to a thru-hiker. We giggled, asking that if they ever spoke to the gentleman again to please thank him! As we hiked through the campground, we stopped to chat and giggle with Light Cloud (section hiker) and Frog (his dog). We showered, washed our clothes, and charged our electronics.

The wind began howling that evening. We snuggled into our warm sleeping quilts, clean, and happy and thanked the campground Trail Angel for allowing us to share his campsite. We giggled, wondering how does the Appalachian Trail know what we need?!?!","Pinefield Hut, Virginia

Our townhouse tent withstood the strong winds that howled all night long. We woke to freezing temperatures, so we bundled up early and off we trekked. As we were leaving the campground, we met a hiker without a name. Now in the world of hikers, you are just a wanderer on the Appalachian Trail until you are dubbed an official title. So, we dubbed him Toasty! It was his first cold night on the trail, yet his tent kept him toasty warm. Such a fine name for such a fine hiker. We all giggled and we trekked on!!

The Appalachian Trail awarded us with terrain of easy ups and downs and few rocks after such a cold windy night. When the wind stopped, the gnats returned! Yikes!! Swamp Irish, the jokester, said there are no more gnats…and no less either, so we giggled and put on our nets before continuing our trek.

During the day, we stopped to giggle and gather information from fellow hikers: Navigator, Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum, and Nature Girl & Logo. In real life, that is just a good excuse to take a break from huffing and puffing.

The last 2 miles of terrain to Riprap Trail were steep. There, we found a nice little tent site to set up camp for the night.

It’s time to pop up our tent and make our beds. Sleeping bags are like a Jack in Box. You pull the string and immediately the bag pops out of the sack, making you giggle. Today, the Appalachian Trail was full of delightful adventures!!","Loft Mountain Campground, Virginia

Brrr, it’s cold outside!!! Oh yes, we are outside!! The Appalachian Trail gives us many gifts, but we were not sure this cold weather is a gift. Then, we unzipped the townhouse tent doors to a beautiful sunrise and giggle. Definitely a gift!!! So off we trekked after a hot breakfast. The terrain was easy with gentle slopes and not too many rocks.

We met Pizza and Beer who were going northbound. You guessed it! They were headed to the next town to get pizza and beer. We giggled, exchanged upcoming terrain information, and trekked on.

It was to be raining and freezing, so we opted to go into town for the night. Stanimal’s shuttled us into town and put us up in a wonderful bunk room. The hostel was a lovely old home away from home for hikers.

We took hot showers, washed clothes, had a fine meal from McDonald’s (not much out there because of COVID-19), and snuggled into a cozy bed, giggling and knowing the Appalachian Trail has sent us to a safe haven for the night!!","Riprap Trail, Virginia

Burrrr, it’s still cold, but the rain disappeared, turning into a sunny day. The hostel was bustling with hikers heading back to the Appalachian Trail to slack pack.

Today’s terrain was a bit rocky with lots of easy climbing as we finished the Shenandoah’s. The pathway was filled with autumn colors of yellows and more reds than before. There were tunnels of budding rhododendrons. Guess the crazy cool weather has them thinking it’s spring. The squirrels were gathering nuts; occasionally they seemed to be throwing them at us. “The sky is falling!” said Henny Penny. This made us giggle, thinking of all the ways we could make meals out of them (the squirrels, not the nuts), and hunting season is open back home!

Stanimal’s gathered all their slack packer children/hikers for the evening from the Appalachian Trail. Some of the hikers were Runaway Teen Mom (Shiner), Legz, Star, Puffin, and Toasty.  They had a full house. Let’s discuss precious treasures a slack packer should carry for the day: water, snacks, toilet paper, 2 wipes, trekking poles, and charged phone (for taking pictures, of course, Guthooks reading, and to call Stanimal’s when you’re ready to return home). Guess what items were left behind? But, Stanimal’s always came to our rescue. Thanks, Stanimal’s (Adam, Charlie, Ranger, & more)!!!

It is time for all of the happy little children/hikers to fly away from home as Stanimal’s shuttled us back to the Appalachian Trail! We thanked Stanimal’s, said our goodbyes, giggled, and trekked into the cool sunshine of the Appalachian Trail! The happy terrain welcomed us back with good easy trekking for the first 7.5 miles.

We decided to go tree climbing today over a tree that had fallen across the path. Now, this was a monster tree not to be hopped over, jumped over, ducked under, or circled around. So we did what any smart hiker would do...looked left, glanced right, scratched our heads, climbed the limbs at the top of the tree, made our way down the trunk like tightrope walkers, plunged to our deaths landing on the Appalachian Trail, and giggled shouting, ‘Whoo Hoo!’ because we made it! Later, we were informed that tree had not been cleared from the trail due to a major yellow jacket bee issue. Yikes!

The terrain then changed suddenly to rocky and steep, going straight up. However, that did not stop Sugar Gal from pausing to take pictures of lots of odd mushrooms, weird shaped roots, and leaves, magically changing from summer to autumn colors.

Along the way, we met up with several thru-hikers: Caboose, Rocky, Bonanza, and Shiner. The Appalachian Trail had given Runaway Teen Mom a new name as she sported her brand new 7 stitches and black eye (her other name is now Shiner). We were then referred to as twins!

We also met Camel, Pancake, and Mosey (lingering in the woods and staying for the night at Paul Wolfe Shelter), all of whom took time out of their very busy hiking schedules to giggle and offer information about the upcoming terrain.

Arriving at an exquisite tent site beside the trail, we set up our townhouse tent on rare, level ground as the sun set. We snuggled into our comfy sleeping quilts, giggling at the odd sights of this magical day: springs that flowed from nowhere trickling across the trail, a tree with no roots that hung and swung from the tree tops above, and lichens growing on enormous rocks that looked like something from outer space!!","Rockfish Gap, Virginia

Every day the Appalachian Trail unfolds new adventures before us and today was no different. The lovely sunrise revealed another hiker’s tent (later we would meet her, Blue Butterfly, a 2019 thru-hiker) at the tent site. We quietly packed our gear and hit the trail, refreshed from the peaceful night’s rest. Ok, we cannot tell a lie...the trail was TERRIBLE, filled with rocks and steep terrain.

Just when you can’t take the terrain torture anymore, the Appalachian Trail magically sends you a fellow hiker who distracts you, so you suddenly see the beauty of the trail. This happy hiker informed us of the sassafras plants ahead which have 3 different shaped leaves...Yum, we giggled while visions of drinking root beer danced in our heads.

The trail revealed beautiful mountain views of snow skiing slopes, library books on a log (guess the Appalachian Trail wanted to educate us), and berries that added accents to the autumn colors. At times the hikers, Moses, Freeze, Sweep, RIP, and Clover, stopped to chat and giggle, informing us of the festival in the town below, complete with beer and music.

It is a little warmer this evening as the sun sets, illuminating twinkling stars and radiant moonlight that light up the sky!

We snuggled into our warm comfy sleeping quilts, and before drifting off to sleep we giggled, listening to the music of the festival in the valley, far below our spot on the Appalachian Trail!!","Tent Site Mile Marker 855.5

We woke up to a breathtaking sunrise, whose beauty inspired us to begin our trek for the day. Our first goal was to replenish our water supply. Upon arriving at Laurel Springs, we frightened a deer that scampered into the woods. We giggled, filled our bottles, and off we trekked. We danced over rocky terrain and used our trekking poles as we hiked over steep terrain, a huffin’ and a puffin’.

The Appalachian Trail kept us cool while entertaining us with chipmunks and squirrels playing, owls hooting, cicadas chirping, springs trickling, and huge colorful autumn leaves that carpeted the path as we trekked to our Georgia destination. Then we passed a hiker who informed us that around the bend, it’s gorgeous. We came to a screeching halt. Did she say...around the bend is Georgia?!?!? You mean we hiked nearly the whole trail in 98 days?! We have been hiking too long and are delirious!! We giggled and kept trekking!

Around the bend was not Georgia, but we found Maupin Field Shelter where we met Pole Cat, a humorous character on the trail. Between Pole Cat and the dry humor of Swamp Irish, they kept us giggling all evening. So Book Worm and Trapper John, who wandered into camp for supper, didn’t stand a chance. Guess that is why they decided to trek a little farther down the trail.

Pole Cat lit a fire. Swamp Irish asked if he would be singing. All giggled!

We slid into our comfy sleeping quilts and giggled as we waited for Pole Cat to break into song, singing “Kumbaya” to entertain the Appalachian Trail! Sweet Dreams AT!!!","Tent Site Mile Marker 850.9

After hearing The Priest Mountain was such a nightmare, we decided to get an early start today so that we could get to the base this evening. “Up we got and away we trot!” The terrain was easy over Bee Mountain, but quickly changed to steep climbs that were loaded with rocks, rocks, and more rocks of all kinds. No one mentioned that the Three Ridges Mountain on the Appalachian Trail was such a nightmare! Our feet started to hurt after 30 minutes. We thought surely the rocks will get better. (“Don’t call me Shirley!”) 
Every once in a while, the Appalachian Trail wants to make sure you stay in shape, so before long we were climbing boulders. Three Ridges Mountain was steep — one huge rock/boulder field. Many times while climbing, holding onto trees and boulders was a must. The trekking poles were a life saver! The Three Ridges Mountain was a nightmare, so we are dreading The Priest!

As you know, the Appalachian Trail gives pleasant distractions to make the rough terrain bearable. So the trail sent us at least 100 walking sticks because nothing else can live on this rocky terrain!

Springs flowed out from under trees and rock boulders from time to time, refreshing us with icy cold water. Butterflies and giant grasshoppers fluttered past us, as did many hikers. “They come and go so quickly, Toto!” We giggled, exchanging terrain information with Secret Agent and Mischief. (Mischief is an amputee hiking the trail to encourage others to believe there is nothing you can’t accomplish. We wish the ATC would recognize determined hikers like Mischief this year.)

The terrain became an easy hiking path a half mile before reaching Harper’s Creek Shelter.

The shelter was a quaint shelter with a tranquil stream flowing through the camping area. Several local campers asked why we were hanging our bear bags in the trees. We giggled, it is a bear area with warning signs everywhere and no bear poles or boxes to be found, hence we hang.

Exhausted, we snuggled into our cozy sleeping quilts, listened to the tranquil stream, and giggled at the cicadas chirping before drifting into a sweet slumber on the Appalachian Trail!","Maupin Field Shelter, Virginia

On the 100th day, the Appalachian Trail gifted us with a pleasant trek after yesterday’s nightmare. We woke up to the tranquil stream flowing nearby and decided to take our time trekking to Tye River, the base of The Priest Mountain. The terrain was easy with lots of switch backs going up and down and few or no rocks, hence Happy Feet! Today was certainly a welcome relief from yesterday’s trek. Along the trail we encountered squirrels scampering through the woods while gathering nuts for the winter and saw leaves gently falling to the ground, continuing to cover the already leaf-coated terrain. As the autumn-colored leaves fell and hit the ground, they sounded like the cereal that goes snap, crackle, pop.

There were many snakes, toads, and eye of newt...sounds like a witch’s brew. We giggled, saying maybe we are just hungry and the rumors from fellow hikers are that a place near our destination has hamburgers and fries. Yeah Buddy...hike faster Swamp Irish, I’m hungry!

Arriving at Tye River Suspension Bridge, we enjoyed a delicious lunch of ramen noodles (Dang, COVID-19, no hamburgers and fries for us), set up camp for the evening, and gathered icy cold water from the stream/river. Hey, let’s splash in the stream and wash essentials like underwear. Time for a nap!!! The Appalachian Trail won’t mind! Hee Hee Hee!

After supper we hung our bear bags, then snuggled down for the night, and instead of tranquil water, we could hear the rushing water of the nearby river.

Today we were up for the challenge that the Appalachian Trail presented to us.

The Tye River Suspension Bridge swayed, tickling out fancy, making us giggle as we started our trek. The terrain was a gentle steep climb of switchbacks, zigzagging up the mountain, making the trek an easy trail with few rocks and roots. Yay! Up, up, and away we went. There is never a dull moment on the Appalachian Trail! The sights and sounds started with birds singing, woodpeckers tapping on trees for their morning breakfast, hunting dogs barking in the distance, streams rushing between the mountains, toads and frogs hopping across the path, and squirrels gathering nuts for the winter. The most amazing sound was a tree falling in the distance at 8:20 this morning which saddened our hearts.

We trekked, singing, when we rounded a switchback near a stream spying a message for us. 600 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced over the stone, taking pictures!

Nut Fairies from the Shenandoah's must have passed the word to the Berry Fairies on Priest Mountain that we would be celebrating 600 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail! So they sweetly left us a spectacular berry message! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with an easy upward terrain of trekking alongside a refreshing stream with tiny waterfalls along the mountain path.

There are no pictures or words to describe the beauty we have experienced as we celebrated our 600 miles on the Appalachian Trail!

The high altitude near the summit made it hard to breathe & our water bottles popped. The rocks were only an issue along the top. ‘Truthpick’, ‘Declan’ & ‘Snack Pack’ also enjoyed a trek on The Priest.

The Priest Shelter was where we refreshed our water bottles while chatting with fellow hikers. Looking in the shelter journals we noticed everyone’s confessions, giggling we trekked on.

After the shelter the trail magically changed to an easy hiking path. Looking over the ridge to colorful mountains beside us.
Today was a special day filled with many amazing adventures on the Appalachian Trail! You never know what magical wonders await you.

Let’s do a 10 miler today! Giggling, off we trekked!

The autumn colors have begun to hide the Appalachian Trail as they are putting the path to sleep for a long winter’s nap. At times, we only have white blazes on the trees to guide the way.

Easy trekking at times; however, the morning dew has leaves and stumps that are slippery when wet...and damp. Slow Down!!!

Yes, today there are stumps in the trail and we have named them...Stump-A-Lena. You hit the hidden stumps and lean a little until your trekking poles catch you. Our trekking poles flaunted colorful fall leaf shoes, making us giggle.

We played Marco Polo in the woods. Swamp Irish was booking it with his “Woo-hoos” on downward slopes, flat trails, and peak tops.

The boulder rocks are in the shapes of what looks like giant dinosaur eggs and water is rare, only marked by H2O carvings on the trees.

We met Juice (thru-hiker) who was hiking faster than us and planned on arriving at Springer before the first of the year. We wished him luck and trekked on!

Thank goodness we have arrived at the rough dirt road...there’s a tent site area somewhere...found it!!! We trekked 10 miles today! Woo-hoo!!

Something strange happened this morning. We awakened to a perfectly cool, sunny morning with easy terrain, very few rocks, and gently flowing hills. Our trekking poles found another use...sweeping dry leaves off the path to uncover loose rocks. The foliage has drastically changed to dainty colorful flowers decorating the trail as if to bid us farewell. We stepped into green meadows where we met fellow hiker, Michelle, who warned us of partying campers at Hog Camp Gap. There were over 30 tents set up in the gap, so we lounged on our comfy sofa rock next to the road and enjoyed the camper’s country music while waiting for a shuttle, giggling.

Sunlight dances across the mountains in the distance. The magical feeling of the Appalachian Trail floating in the air seems to wave goodbye to us as we leave the trail.

Day 107

Windy gusts during the night sounded like roaring waves on a beach. They began about 10 p.m. and continued until morning.

Every day is full of wonders on the Appalachian Trail and today’s excitement was filled with steep downward treks. We spied our first U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Marker, which made us giggle and dance with joy! Along the trail we enjoyed trees only adorned with serviceberry white flowers, sprinkles of tiny purple and yellow flowers to line the path along the way, trickling streams, majestic sparkling icicles, breathtaking mountains, and the James River below to guide us to Glasgow.

We took the time to chat with hikers Big Spoon, Turtle Hawk, Brave Heart, and Beef Stick who informed us of upcoming trail closures and terrain.

The last mile meandered along the James River where Mr. Charlie awaited our arrival. Once arriving at Stanimal’s Hostel, we feasted on a yummy meal at Scotto’s, a refreshing shower, and a sweet dessert prepared by Mr. Charlie.

Because of freezing temperatures, hikers, Cajun & Weezie (from Louisiana), Walking Stick, Daniel, Action & Adventure, Wonzie, and Almost There & Happy came to the pampered arms of Stanimal’s; Strings, and Mr. Charlie. We were informed of the closures of the Blue Ridge Parkway and a section of the Appalachian Trail due to severe weather and downed power lines.

As we snuggled in our comfy bunks, we giggled, thanking the Appalachian Trail for spoiling us with Mr. Charlie’s nightly tasty delights!!","Punchbowl Shelter, Virginia

We resupplied, washed clothes, hiked in town, ate lunch at Scotto’s again (the only restaurant in town, but lucky for us they have excellent food), sat around playing the harp, listened to music from kids, and tied knots!

Mr. Charlie cooked Lost Bread for breakfast, and blueberry strudel to enchanted us with evening tasty delights!

After gathering much info from experienced hikers, we are off to slack pack and cover many miles today....if this is cheating, we strongly encourage cheating!!!!

So, we trekked from Petites Gap to James River, 10 miles with lovely views of the James River.

We pranced on crunchy, frozen ground that made us giggle.

Due to major ice storms, there were trees down with several round-abouts, hop-overs, crawl-throughs, and scratch-your-head moments! So we straddled mud, discovered giant icicles, and enjoyed an easy trek, giggling with hikers Just Matt, Happy, Bag Bowl, and Luke.

We have learned there is nothing a Trail Angel won’t do for a hiker. Renee, a Trail Angel, trekked 2 miles with hot Chick-fil-A sandwiches to Matt’s Creek Shelter. They were well needed and so Yummy!! Thanks. Renee!!!

The last mile of slack packing was along the James River, complete with low-flying planes and kayakers.

At day’s end, we giggled over the fact that the Appalachian Trail is kind to Slack Packers and rested peacefully at Stanimal’s Hostel!!Happy Anniversary Mom & Dad!","Petites Gap, Virginia

Pock Pock - The Easter Bunny Came!

Mr. Charlie bid us goodbye at Petites Gap. Today is Easter, so the Appalachian Trail blessed us with easy terrain as we watched a giant white ball on a far away mountain grow larger and larger as we progressed through the day. There were blue butterflies fluttering past us from time to time to guide the way and the trail continued paralleling the lifeless Blue Ridge Parkway. The terrain changed to small rocks as we approached the Guillotine. Then the rock climbing began, along with giant icicles and frozen streams to distract from the tedious terrain. Hikers, Giggles, Screentime, Bambi, Altra, 5 Stack, Todd, Smiles & Link, Hard Rock, Walkie Talkie, Pirie, and Narrly stopped to chat and giggle about upcoming terrain.

The climb brought us up to 4200' where it was very windy. The temperatures of 38 degrees made the ground very cold by the time we reached the Apple Orchard Mountain Tent Site.

Wow, now that Giant White Ball is ENORMOUS! Turns out it is the Federal Aviation Radar Station, complete with a phone charging station. Yea!!!

After enjoying a hot breakfast, we said goodbye to the giant white ball to begin our day’s trek of nice terrain. If the sign says Black Rock Overlook, that means you’re going to CLIMB over the big black rock to look at...another mountain! The Big White Ball was on the mountain next to us most of the day while we enjoyed easy ups and downs with pretty white flowers lining the path to tent site 765.4. We were so excited because the water source to resupply our water was only .1 mile...straight downhill, then straight back up.

Intruder, Long Walker, Tin Man (wife Gouda), Betty White, Amy, John, Butter, Roadrunner, Oz, and Reader were just a few hikers that we stopped to chat and giggle with to gather trail information.

We’ll be coming around the mountain when we come. . .with zigzags that can’t make up their minds which way to go...Huh, except down. The Appalachian Trail rewarded us with a pleasant hiking terrain. There were little dips across the trail to drain water, lots of bugs (grab your bug net), tiny flowers (grab your phone for a pic), brown fluttering butterflies, breathtaking views as we trekked the ridge, and a tick. A TICK!!! Run for your lives!!!! There were head bangers, neck chokers, pole grabbers, knee knockers, and rockin’ rocks to keep us alert.

Hikers love to share information about the trail and today was no different as we giggled with Attila, Grits, Grambo, Awesome, 2nd Winds & Lungs, HMC (happily married couple), and Troop 62.

The Appalachian Trail woke us to a beautiful starry sky. A train whistle was our alarm clock this morning, and the sounds of the city in the valley below chimed in. Today’s trekking was easy with lots of ups and downs. We witnessed white petals falling from the trees like gentle snowflakes to the ground, blueberry bushes in bloom for future hikers to enjoy their fruits, and the Blue Ridge Parkway is still closed.

We enjoyed the company of fellow hikers, while giggling with Free Bird, Eragon, Tenacious Turtle, Goober, Snoozer & Momma Bear, Tie Dye, Lungs, Lost & Found, Picky Vicky, Lenithan, and Not Yet as they shared upcoming information.

The Appalachian Trail graced us with the only level tent site at Bobblets Gap Shelter. So we snuggled into our warm quilts, and giggled at the hiker who gave us a lecture on eating healthy!

Swamp Irish is flying on the Appalachian Trail this morning, thanks to his winged Merrell wide hiking shoes that he got from John at Outdoor Trail for today’s slack pack (slack packin is where you start at one area, hike the trail for the day, and someone (usually in a vehicle) brings you back to where you began. There are several areas in the trail that do this.) It was a cool, breezy day, easy terrain down the mountain after three miles of up and down, crossing lots of streams, and a walk in the clouds. . .or. . .the fog.

Papa Bear, Gentle Ben, and Aspen giggled, commenting on our tiny slack pack.

We trekked and sang, and when we rounded a switchback near a stream, spied a message for us. 700 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang some more, and danced over the giant mushroom, and took pictures!

Berry Fairies from The Priest must have passed the word to the Fuzzy Fairies on Fullhart Knob that we would be celebrating 700 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail! So they sweetly left us a spectacularly, fuzzy message!  The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with new flowers and amazing umbrella plants (the Mayapple, featuring a white flower ball dangling under an umbrella of broad leaves)!!

The Appalachian Trail presented us with many delightful memories today! As we began our hike through a barren forest with no streams, a puddle of water appeared on the ground from out of nowhere, and water dripped from above. A water vine flowed freely, proving the Appalachian Trail will provide. We giggled, danced around the puddle, drank from the water provided, and trekked onward to begin the Triple Crown.

Tinkerbells  joined us as we began a fairly easy terrain toward the Triple Crown 👑!

Starting at Tinker Cliffs, the trek was fairly easy, yet slightly steep at times. For those of you who do not have clue as to what the Triple Crown entails, let me enlighten you...3 of the most amazing rock formations with the most gorgeous views you have ever witnessed! Breathtaking does not begin to describe them. When God created the Appalachian Trail...the Triple Crown was His majestic crowning masterpiece!!!

Tinker Cliffs had icy wind gust blowing, but that did not stop us from admiring its beauty! Even long after we passed Tinker Cliffs, we could see the cliffs’ charm from afar.

Off we went to McAfee Knob, enjoying easy trekking with ups and downs, through bushes, paths of rocks and dirt, steps, and watery trails flowing down the mountain. McAfee Knob’s beauty calmed all our fears and the rock formation was not as scary as we originally thought. We slowly stepped out onto the ledge, giggled, paused for a picture (thanks to hikers enjoying the view), and danced off to safety. We happily trekked to the next shelter.

We encountered 14 hikers… Pan, Wind, Up, Kindle, Killer, Wizard, Goldie, Jamin, Yard Sale, Hatchback, Great Value, Skeeter, Chesets, and Yack Track . They shared upcoming Dragons Tooth terrain information giggled because they knew what perils await us.

Now, don’t listen to Swamp Irish when he says we will dine upon arriving at Dragon’s Tooth...the climb to Dragons Tooth took US ONLY 6 hours! Did we take a wrong turn?!?! The terrain was rocky with lots of rock scrambles and mini boulders, causing us to climb on slanted edges with no footing. Just watch how the young whippersnappers do it...Yeah, right!

We quickly discovered north of the tooth is very steep with hard rock climbing guided by white blazes on the rocks pointed in odd directions.

Low and behold, Dragon’s Tooth stood in all of her majestic splendor! Now, that was the crowning moment of our day, melting all of our worries away as we sat on strategically placed rocks, admiring the view.

Trekking south of the tooth was a very nice downward hike with few rock scrambles, so we arrived at our shelter destination quickly.

We found a nice tent site, resupplied water, and prepared a yummy supper.

There were many foot bridges that crossed the beautiful blue water of Craig Creek, so we decided to set up at a tent site along the creek.

As nightfall settled over the mountains, we giggled, saying before setting up camp you should always look up for creaky (dead) trees and down for dog dooky. (I hate dog poop!

There is never a boring moment on the Appalachian Trail, and today was filled with new adventures at every turn on this freezing cold morning! We trekked easy up and down terrain, billy goat ridges, mossy green foliage forest floors, pine forests, and muddy trails (the sign at Angel’s Rest Hiker Haven said, “Call Your Mom” beand & bees. Bees!!! We traveled with caution when a hiker informed us of a hornet’s nest!!! Well guess what...as we approached the bees, we began to giggle!!! They were honey bees swarming...good thing he had just gotten his masters degree...maybe it wasn’t a bee degree. We have many honey bee hives...New River Honey, Yummy!!! So, we know honeybees are harmless when swarming.

Hikers had only one thing on their minds today...eating at Trent’s! Oh Man! It’s worth every delicious bite as we all giggled, enjoying the food and hospitality!!! 😍

Hikers ASAP & Go (can’t repeat what wives call them), Excel, Jack Rabbit, Prophet, Stumbles, Febreze (we gave him the name), Flavor Packet, and many more enjoyed Trent’s.

We’re snuggled in for the night, giggling at the hiker (and the expression on his face) who trekked an extra 1.4 miles because he got turned around (we all do it), so we pointed him in the right direction...to Katahdin. The Appalachian Trail knew we were exhausted, so it graced us with a fine stealth site and a trickling stream to soothe us into sweet slumber!!","Tent Site 612.4, Virginia

The Appalachian Trail wants to see if you are paying attention every once in a while, so it throws a nightmare day of trekking at you! Ok, Ok! We are paying attention!!! Today’s trekking was a straight up and down, hot as blazes, and a painful feet day. However, the Appalachian Trail also gave sweet distractions that entertained us to take our minds off of the discomforts: camouflage lizards that blended into the nearby trees, tiny colorful flowers, survey markers, 600 mile marker, 1593 mile marker, & streams that pop up out of nowhere!

Creatively named hikers we briefly paused with to chat of upcoming terrain were Palmetto & Abdullah, Captain, Meat Suit, Mission D, Hammer, Skull, and Cocoon, as well as many other hikers and slack packers.

Finally, we arrived at our tent site destination, put up our tent townhouse, ate dessert first, then supper, and climbed into our sleep liners (too hot for quilts tonight), giggling that our southern accent translation of ‘Swamp Irish’ to hikers is translated to Small Virus. . .we enjoy the Appalachian Trail Hiker trail names!!","Stealth Site 604.8, Virginia

As Al Jolson sang, “I’m sitting, on top, top of the world!”, and we are enjoying the most beautiful sunrise!! Move it, Sugar Gal!! Bland awaits us! The Appalachian Trail has decided to delight us with easy terrain, no rocks on flowing hills as we played Marco Polo and Peekaboo I See You, on the trail. Sugar Gal led the way taking pictures of lizards, miniature colorful flowers, and interesting trees until she had enough of the spider webs. Giggling, she thought, “It’s time to turn leadership over to Swamp Irish!”

We flew through the miles until we met Runway, then the chatting and giggling began as Runway informed us of upcoming water sources and hostels to visit.

Most of the hikers we met were at Bushy Mountain Outposts where we gathered to feast on yummy foods of all kinds. Repeat, Super Mom & Super Girl, Honey Badger, Arrow, Peter Pan, Frosty, Low Cash, and Dallas (her husband gave us trail magic of Gatorade and beer).

Trail magic comes is all kinds of shapes and sizes. We were unable to reach the shuttle driver to get a ride into town. At that moment, a car pulled up, out jumped a hiker, and Sugar Gal boldly asked was that a shuttle driver. He replied no but she would take you wherever you wanted to go. Now the Appalachian Trail is amazing, coming to the aid of hikers, gifting Trail Magic and Angels! Today it would be a sweet hiker (retired Marine, alumni of LSU, from Louisiana, with last name of Broussard) and his sweet wife who was headed back to Bland to get on I-77 to return home. Go figure, this time a true Louisianan from our home state. Geaux Tygrs!!!

Now, some hikers may refer to today’s trek on the Appalachian Trail as a boring day, but we found the trail an amazing wonderment at every switchback and a way of repairing the body for the next major adventure. For this day of easy peasy trekking, the terrain guided us up and around, only to discover we’re going up and down. The toe tippers (logs) cause you to fall down, roll down, lay down...no matter what...you are going down!

The trail entertained us with double butterflies, new saplings (a major fire had killed hundreds of trees and now new saplings are sprouting up, carpeting the Appalachian floor), and did you know there are fairy villages along the trail?!?!

We had the pleasure of chatting and giggling (we giggled more than we chatted) with Spice, Proton, Doc, GoneWithTheWind (all one word), Just Scott, Maybe, Wart Hog, Luau, and Chaser, gathering information of the upcoming terrain. Chaser was also a Trail Angel, doling out honey buns and oatmeal cakes. . .Yummy!!! Thanks Chaser!

The weather forecast was for rain this evening, so we made an executive decision to set up our townhouse tent before it began. . .very wise on our part. We ate a yummy meal of chicken flavored chicken, resupplied our water, and snuggled down just as the rain began to pitter patter on the tent fly.

After a night of off-and-on rain showers, the Appalachian Trail delighted us with a starry sky and a brightly shining moon that illuminated the tent townhouse with light just before dawn.

We love the impressive moments the Appalachian Trail gives us, so we danced and giggled over large flat rocks going up the mountain. Ah yes, today’s terrain was straight up for 1 mile, then a gentle slope that plateaued off. . .that’s a woohoo moment!!

Tremor, Blue Bear, Howling Winds, Princeton, Finley, Tofu, Pibb, Poison Ivy, Dragon Sky, Grumpy Cat, Turtle, Bobo, and Jump Rope all stopped to chat and giggle, exchanging information of upcoming terrain.

The winds howled from lunchtime until midnight, with gusts up to 50 mph, but our Marmot Mansion kept us safely sheltered from the wind. We held each other, giggled, sang “Happy Birthday” to our sweet son Mike, turned on the radio to listen to “Deeper than the Holler” by Randy Travis and “It’s 5 O’Clock Somewhere” by Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett, then drifted off to sleep to the roaring sounds of the Appalachian Trail!!","Tent Site 585, Virginia

Yea! The Marmot Mansion is still standing after a night of fierce winds and a chilly 35 degree morning! So, we packed up and off we trekked to birds and woodpeckers enjoying an early breakfast on the Appalachian Trail.

Every day the Appalachian Trail astonishes the senses with new sights, smells, and sounds.

Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! The easy terrain of ups and downs has reasonable rocks, hair-brushing limbs, colorful dainty flowers, fluttering butterflies leading the way, sitting rabbits, survey markers, and singing birds. Swamp Irish finds a different flower on the trail every day for Sugar Gal to admire and photograph while taking a break.

We sang “Chestnuts roasting on an open fire; Jack Frost nipping at your nose”, while we headed to Chestnut Shelter in icy cold temperatures. The shelter was a quaint, enclosed shelter with a breathtaking view of the surrounding mountains and valley below. To get out of the wind, we decided to trek down the mountain and past the duck pond (which has no ducks).

We met hikers who informed us that technically. . .slack packing north while going south is actually northbound. Now, that is hiker reasoning that made us Stop, Scratch Our Heads, Think Hard, and Agree, making us Giggle as we trekked on!

Then there were Trunks, Dad, Readjuster, Loosely, Surly, Possum, Big Talker, Duck, Olga, and 2 Whoppers (who’s still looking for water, trying to figure out how to work Guthooks after 3 weeks on the trail. . .just ask a helpful hiker).

We arrived at a secluded stealth site near a duck pond. Somewhere out there, there’s a hiker with degree from Columbia University still looking for the ducks. . . SCARY. . .LOL. We set up our tent townhouse, resupplied our water, and cooked a yummy supper. After snuggling down for the night, we giggled as we ate trail magic from Trail Angel, Bird Dog.

The Appalachian Trail knew we needed an easy day, so we were granted one easy day of gentle flows, smooth trekking, no rocks, barren burned forest at times, fairy villages, and survey markers.

Every easy day needs a splash of adventure, literally. Soooo, let’s tiptoe through the tulips. . .or in this case, through the creek. The Lick Creek footbridge is out! Several hikers (Still Buns, Maine, Geo, Avatar, Turtle, and Pup) informed us of the water’s depth. Upon arriving at the creek, hikers were shucking hiking shoes, taking a break from trekking, and drying soaked clothes (you guessed it, they fell in). Everyone waded, splishing and splashing, across Lick Creek, giggling because the icy cold water tickled their toes. We did it! Easy Peasy! Time to trek onward to the parking area where Lumberjack would scoop us up bringing us to the hostel.

Hostels are hit or miss when it comes to accommodations. After bathing, washing our stinky hiker clothes, and being fed a yummy supper, we giggled as we lay in our bunks knowing the Appalachian Trail had gently guided us into the safe haven of the Appalachian Dreamer Hostel. . .by far, one of the best!!","Stealth Site 567.8, Virginia

What is not awesome about slack pack trekking!?!? Hummm the Appalachian Trail thought it would throw us a curveball. Is that a black cloud in the distance moving this way? Trek faster, Swamp Irish; I felt a droplet! Before long, the cloud decided to dump rain on our parade, quickly turning to hail. Trekking onward, out popped the sun; we giggled and immediately sang, “I got sunshine on a rainy day.” We trekked an easy terrain for the rest of the day, enjoying fields, flowers, fence crossings, and magical fairy villages. Let’s cut through this hill of a thousand switchbacks. . .busted! Lumbermack, our shuttle driver who had dug ramps (bulb root plant that has an onion-garlic taste) from the Appalachian Trail floor for our supper, met us at the top of the hill and asked us if we were taking a shortcut. Don’t worry, several hikers, including Waitin’ On, decided to play “Follow the Leader” as they trekked right behind us, giggling.

After a delightful day hiking the Appalachian Trail, we gathered in Lumbermack’s commons area, sat in the barbershop chair, danced to vintage songs on the jukebox, enjoyed old fashioned hotdogs & delicious homemade vegetable soup, swapped hiker stories, and giggled.

Leaving Appalachian Dreamer Hiker Hostel, a lovely haven, brought mixed feelings to our hearts, so we giggled letting Lumbermack know, ‘Parting is such sweet sorrow’ as he released us into the arms of the Appalachian Trail.

The Appalachian Trail’s alarm clock was turkeys gobbling, and we giggled because they knew hunting season ended three days ago. Gentle slopes of ups and downs with flower petals sprinkled, carpeting the path. Nice boardwalks meandering through the swamp. . .Oh dear, watch out for alligators! Never mind, we’re not in Louisiana.

The rain storm came, chasing hikers (Baby Face, Duck, Traveler, Maine, JJ (Just Joe), Bowy, Unkept Bed, Trail Monkey, Timber, Viking, Rusty Flats, and Redwood) into the shelter for the evening where they exchanged upcoming terrain information and adventures they experienced.

We wished all at the shelter a Happy Cinco de Mayo! They were northbound and were giggling with excitement that the Mexican restaurant was just a few miles down the trail. . .Real FOOD!

Today must be National Appalachian Trail Test Day because the day started with a cold drizzle, then led to a walk in the clouds (heavy fog), strong icy winds, very rocky paths, and oh yes. . .give us rain. Dang now, the trail is a hip boot muddy mess! Shucks – the path is a rising bayou (does a bayou even rush. . .it does here!). Sugar Gal’s feet hurt, Swamp Irish’s knee hurts, and then we grumbled, crossing our water source bridge. . .

At the stream, the grumpiness turned to a blissful happiness, melting all of our misery away as we spied a message just for us. 900 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced over the mossy patch as we took pictures!

Dogwood/Fluffy Fairies from Sugar Run Mountain must have passed the word to the Acorn Fairies on Glade Mountain that we would be celebrating 900 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail! So they sweetly left us a spectacular acorn message! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with an easy terrain for the rest of the day.

Today was a special day filled with many challenging, but amazing adventures on the Appalachian Trail! You never know what magical wonders await you.

Did you hear that? Can I roll over and go back to sleep? No, Sugar Gal, it is just the pitter patter of raindrops hitting the tent townhouse mansion. By the time we gathered our food from the bear box, ate breakfast, and packed our backpacks, the drizzling rain had ended. Most of the hikers left camp at the same time, giggling as we wished each other a safe and happy hike.
The weather was a little cold and windy so we trekked faster on easy terrain to stay warm. We were sun seekers hiking over few rocks, with green foliage bursting forth and acorns rooting themselves into the forest floor on our way to Dickey Gap. Hum, the trail signs are a little confusing. There are white blazes where the blue blazes should be, no. ..make that white and blue blazes, no. . .make that blue blazes where the white blazes should be, no...the sign says go this way, no. . .Guthooks & AWOL say go that way. . .hummm are you confused yet, cause we surely are!

The southbounders (everyone else is going northbound) that we are...made it fun to play the game with hikers asking the question, ‘Are you going southbound?’ We would answer, “No we’re going northbound! You’re going the wrong way!” It’s fun to play with hikers’ minds so that we all stay sharp and to fight off boredom! We would all giggle and trek onward.

Now, hikers can be amusing to watch and today was no different. We met The Prayer, hiking with his hands together. How does he catch himself with no tracking poles? There was also Flip Flop Man. Does it hurt when he stumps his toes on rocks or roots? And The Masked Bandit...how the heck does he breath while huffing and puffing as he hikes?

Oh well, Monkey Toes had trekking poles in hand, hiking boots on, and no mask so she was pretty safe in our opinion. On the Appalachian Trail, no one cares about our opinion, which makes us giggle.

Laying safely in our cozy sleeping quilts, we giggled thinking even the Appalachian Trail has a sense of humor, giving us the feeling we were in the movie Rat Race on the trail today, being sent the wrong way, reading the signs...“You Should Have Bought a Squirrel” while trekking straight downhill to nowhere!!!","Trimpi Shelter, Virginia

We spied different tiny white and yellow flowers, while woodpeckers tapped a musical song, and trees made squeaky, creaky sounds as we hiked the ridge of Hurricane Mountain. The Appalachian Trail decided we’d had an easy enough hike today and threw very rocky terrain for the rest of the day. If that was not enough, the Scales had gusty blow-me-down winds, grassy highlands with rocks, no trees, and scraggly tiny bushes that looked like something out of the Wild West. We found our reprieve in the wild ponies and the longhorn cows that gave us a taste of the Grayson Highlands to come.

Hikers Chives, Liberty, Stick and Slowpoke, and Slim Jim (a trail runner) took the time to chat and giggle with us, informing us of upcoming terrain and winds.

I hear the pitter-patter of raindrops on the tent rainfly. Rise & Shine...well, forget the shine part. In the time it took to giggle and roll over, the raindrops had stopped. We’ve come to know that on the Appalachian Trail if you aren’t awakened by singing birds, then you are doomed to a rainy day. Guess I was wrong!...“I may not always be right, but I’m never wrong!” is a famous quote from a famous man (my Dad, Pal).

We trekked an easy terrain with a rushing stream that led to the Virginia Creeper Trail. What a fine trail it is! An hour of hiking and it was time to put on our puffy jackets, then rain gear...is it just me, or is it getting worse? The drizzle turned to rain, which turned to sleet, then snow...I’m freezing (upper 20s)! This is when you discover your rain jacket is really just a wind breaker, so now we are soaking wet! ‘Hike faster to stay warm!’ Then, to make matters unbearable, you discover there are no more white blazes. What?!?! Guthooks says you are lost and no longer on the Appalachian Trail. Humm, how did this happen? We are parallel to the trail that is straight up the mountain, in a freezing blizzard, and soaking wet. Giggling stops! Oh wait...Guthooks says this is the Virginia Creeper Trail going into Damascus. We hear a voice from God guiding us in the right direction!!! “What was that, God?” “On your left!” “God, is that You? What did You say?” Then three cyclists zoom by us. Oh dear, we are on a bike trail. We thanked The Dear Lord for saving us and trekked onward, on the right side of the trail. The Dear Lord and The Appalachian Trail have a way of granting what your body needs...an easy trail into town. The rain, sleet, and snow ended six hours later as the trail was lined with drooping flowers, slippery at times, and water running across the path. We arrived in town at a white blaze and the Wicked Chicken. Yummy!!! What was supposed to take three days to trek, took one day.

We discovered hikers entering the restaurant who had also gotten lost in the storm and had followed the same trail as we did into town. We all giggled, remarking that was the quickest 16 miles we have ever trekked. Oh yeah, our first and only 16 miler.

We headed into town to stay at The Place Hostel, a charming old house complete with a bath. Hikers flooded into Damascus to celebrate Trail Days, filling the Hostel with a mini tent city.

It was a short walk from The Place Hostel to Trail Days. We saw Tent City and talked to Vendors and Hikers.

The Appalachian Trail sprinkled hostels all along the trail to care for its hikers.  Let’s face the facts...all hikers need a hostel from time to time!

Excellent hostel expectations have the following:

A bed or bunk A hot shower
A laundry room or access to a laundromat
A charging station
A kitchenette and/or commons area

Optional amenities:

A resupply location nearby
A shuttle service to and from the trail

We stayed in a hostel cottage...wish we would have stayed at The Place Hostel. Our definition of a cottage is a small building containing a bed, shower, and toilet...bomp, wrong answer! Their cottage had a bed, nightstand, TV, mini fridge, and 10:00 breakfast.

Now, for the rest of the story...Shower in an outside shed, rough cement floor that hurt your feet, no light or heat, no soap, spider webs everywhere, and maggots and rodent feces covering the entire shower floor. Swamp Irish cleaned and bleached the floor.

The toilet was in a different outside shed with a rough cement floor, no light or heat, cold water only, spider webs everywhere, and maggots and rodent feces filling the floor as well. Sugar Gal cleaned the floor. So, if you needed to use the bathroom during the night, you had to dress, grab a flashlight, run out in the cold, use it, run back, and get back into bed to get warm.

The cottage door had no window, but we were given a portable heater because the temperature was dropping to freezing. We also snuggled under our cozy sleeping quilts for warmth.

Forget a secluded cottage — we should have stayed inside the main house in bunks, complete with heat and indoor bathrooms. Here is the best part...we paid double because it was Trail Days. Even Stinky Hiker Trash deserves better...oh yes, that would be us.

Censored! Not for under-aged children! Don’t show your Mama! Hikers have a disgusting way of entertaining themselves (“Blazing Saddles” moment...snot rockets, farts, & belching). So after lunch, Sugar Gal giggled and decided to ask Swamp Irish how to make yourself belch, because she felt the need and it was just not happening. Well then, let’s try farts...nothing. Well then, tums...nothing. My belly hurts.

A couple tenths from the destination at Double Spring Shelter, Sugar Gal did the unspeakable on the Appalachian Trail...dropped her pack!!!! Swamp Irish came to her aid, making sure she was in the best of hikers’ hands at the shelter, returned for her pack, setup the tent townhouse, and at 5 p.m., placed her gently onto her sleeping gear where she showed him the magic button on her phone (which is never to be touched...Emergency Zone). At 7 p.m. he asked if she was okay and she whispered between groans, “Hit the button.” The shelter tent area was full of exhausted hikers who soon drifted into a peaceful slumber.

About 9 p.m., the woods around us lit up like giant lightning bugs as rescue volunteers came to do what they do best...care for a hiker in distress. Vitals were checked; a rescue basket was lined with the sleeping quilts; and Sugar Gal was carefully lifted from the tent, placed into the basket, and covered to protect her from the frigid temperatures. The Emergency Rescue Team (15-20 volunteers) was amazing as they meticulously took turns carrying their precious cargo 3 miles on the Appalachian Trail to reach the waiting ambulance. Six carried the basket (rotating rescuers from time to time); one led the way informing others of every rock, hole, tree, limb, and uneven terrain; two carried chainsaws clearing the debris; one carried emergency equipment; several walked beside ready to rotate out when needed; one stayed in touch with the dispatcher at all times; and 1 whispered to Sugar Gal constantly for 2 1/2 hours, reassuring her that they would soon have her in the ambulance.

The Appalachian Trail opened up its arms to safely release Sugar Gal into the caring arms of the Volunteer Emergency Rescue Team, until Sugar Gal and Swamp Irish may return to the Appalachian Trail to resume their trek.

We hope no hiker ever needs the Volunteer Emergency Rescue Team, but should the need arise you can be confident you will be in capable hands!!","Abingdon Gap Shelter, Tennessee

Sugar Gal is recovering very nicely at Sycamore Shoal Hospital. . .but enough about her. We Thank the Awesome Staff at the Hospital!

Swamp Irish made an executive decision to hike back to Double Springs Shelter to collect our hiking treasures. Shortly after getting back on the trail, he met two day hikers who stopped to chat and giggle, insisting on helping him break down camp and carry the gear back to the parking area. Three miles later, Swamp Irish was relieved to see the bright orange townhouse tent still standing. Keep in mind, no one will touch another hiker’s gear because it is too heavy and they have enough to carry already. All hikers at the shelter pitched in to break down and pack up the gear. Swamp Irish thanked the Trail Angels, in return becoming a Trail Angel himself, doling out all the food hanging in the bear bag to hikers at the shelter in need of food.

We thank all hikers who helped with our new adventure on the Appalachian Trail, especially the day hikers who carried the gear back to the parking area.

We laid in bed, giggling over the kind Trail Angels who fed Swamp Irish with Trail Magic in the parking area upon Swamp Irish’s return from the shelter. Dang, Sugar Gal missed out on the hamburgers (waiting for them in a parking area) that they had dreamed about for months!!!

That’s okay because the Appalachian Trail will provide Trail magic another day, another time, another place!!!","Double Spring Shelter, Tennessee

Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

Swamp Irish, I’m feeling great and the doctors have given me the all clear, so let’s answer the Call of the Wild by returning to the Appalachian Trail. (The medical staff was amazed that Sugar Gal survived the ordeal, mentioning the fact only a hiker in such good health could have survived.  They chose to perform a new procedure so that she could return to the arms of the Appalachian Trail in the future.  We thank the Dear Lord for watching over stinky hikers, sending us to Elizabethton, Tennessee for care, the volunteer emergency team for their kindness, the medical staff for taking excellent care of her and the Appalachian Trail for whipping us into such good shape!)  
 

Our flight to Atlanta, Georgia, was a smooth ride including a perfectly soft take off and landing. Ron giggled, welcomed, and shuttled us to the trail head to continue our adventures on the Appalachian Trail.

The Appalachian Trail welcomed us back by gracing us with an easy trek of gentle slopes, rocks that sparkled like diamonds, birds singing, and lightening bugs that filled the woods with twinkling lights as the sun set.

We climbed into our cozy tent townhouse, positioned on a flat surface, and giggled at the new sounds of the Appalachian Trail...the contagious laughter from Troop 135, the hovering of helicopters, and the firing of gunshots from machine guns and deafening bombs...what a combination!!

The excitement of returning to the Appalachian Trail continued this morning as we arose before day break.

Our adventures began immediately as we trekked Sassafras Mountain with dainty flowers that lined the steep terrain, giant colorful flower mushrooms, tree knee knockers, head bangers, and roundabouts.

Stumbler, a local hiker, took a break to giggle and share a wealth of information about the upcoming terrain.

The entertainment of the day, which the Appalachian Trail bestowed upon us, was when a hiker chatting with her group mentioning people shouldn’t leave trash on the trail. She stepped off the trail, reached down, moved leaves to the side to pickup trash. Listen to the words of the song, ‘Can’t Touch This!’ Rule #1: Never! Ever! Pickup someone else’s toilet paper!!! She quickly dropped it and quietly hiked on! We’re still giggling over this one; cause you just can’t make this stuff up.  The Appalachian Trail bestows the most entertaining moments!!

Exhausted hikers arrived at the shelter for the night, filling the campground with chatter and laughter as they shared their adventures of the day.

We climbed into our cozy sleeping liners, giggling because we have trekked 999 miles. To celebrate our achievements there was an orchestra of hikers snoring in perfect harmony...the Appalachian Trail Symphony!!","Hawk Mountain Campsite, Georgia

Rise and Shine! Birds sang a sweet song to let us know that the Appalachian Trail had a day that would be filled with amazing adventures. The foliage was lush and green, sprinkled with dainty flowers, colorful mushrooms, worms and centipedes wiggling across the trail, and mini rock climbing, including Preaching Rock. We stopped to chat and giggle with Troop 135 and many hikers making their way to Neel Gap.

We trekked and sang, enjoying the day. When we crossed the road at Gooch Gap near a stealth site, we spied a message just for us. 1,000 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced over the sandy dirt, making sure we took pictures commemorating this milestone!

Acorn Fairies from Glade Mountain must have passed the word to the Root/Leaf Fairies on Gooch Mountain that we would be celebrating 1,000 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail! So they sweetly left us a spectacular root and AT leaf message! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with an easy terrain.

Today was an exceptional day filled with many amazing adventures on the Appalachian Trail! You never know what magical wonders await you. We're Thousandaires!

The Appalachian Trail knew we would need two alarm clocks this morning: birds singing and woodpeckers pecking while foraging for breakfast.

We would be trekking Blood Mountain, so we ate a hardy breakfast and packed lots of snacks for the big scary mountain. Much to our surprise, we trekked an easy trail with gentle ups and downs. The climb was a little steep at times, so the Appalachian Trail entertained us with the aroma of what smelled like Sweet Williams flowers, nearly ripe blackberries, colorful mushrooms, dainty flowers, slugs, snails, snakes, mole holes, daddy-longlegs spiders, and mini rock climbs. Blood Mountain was of moderate hiking and we giggled because we did not think it was as tough as other hikers had warned.

We met many day hikers who paused to exchange upcoming terrain and trail angel volunteers maintaining the trail, whom we thanked.

We arrived at Neel Gap; bathed; washed clothes; resupplied; filled water bottles; made use of their charging station; enjoyed pizza, donuts, & sodas; and bid Boy Scout Troop 135 farewell as they headed back home to Florida.

As we have discovered, the Appalachian Trail has a sense of humor.  Our townhouse tent was setup on a sink hole. This gave a whole new meaning to the sport of Slip ‘n Slide! Before drifting off to sleep we giggled, sliding on our comfy pads, watching the lighting bugs and listening to speeding sports cars whiz down the curvy road next to the Appalachian Trail!!

Every day on the Appalachian Trail is an amazing journey, and today Swamp Irish decided we’re going to get to the bottom of this nonsense. . .which is another mountain. The wind blew in the tree tops making a relaxing sound while the breeze kept us cool as we trekked 5 small mountains enjoying views, new colorful flowers, and mushrooms.

We thanked Ron for water trail magic and whistles. Swamp Irish uses his whistle to inform Sugar Gal of upcoming easy terrain...so much for a bear whistle. The trail was filled with giggling hikers who showed us their Ron whistles and stopped to chat, telling their unique adventures. Easy A had hiked parts of the Pacific Coast Trail (PCT), Nanuck was finishing up the Appalachian Trail this year with 45 miles to go, and Matthew & OU Again passed us several times before staying at the shelter with us again.

It started to rain about an hour before arriving at the shelter, making the trail wet with flowing water. Our townhouse tent went up in record time.

Awakened to the pitter-patter of raindrops tapping on the rainfly, we ate yummy bacon and scrambled eggs inside our Marmot mansion. The rain subsided, we packed up, and began today’s trek on a trail filled with running water (i.e., the New River Bayou). The Appalachian Trail gave us easy terrain on this foggy day, stealth sites wherever the terrain was level, mini cascading waterfall streams, head-banger trees, Lemon Squeeze trees that made you wiggle while you giggled to get your pack through them, yellow & pale blue butterflies, bright orange newts, and you guessed it. ..raindrops to keep us cool.

Arriving at the shelter, we quickly cooked supper, hung our bear bags on the bear cables, setup our tent townhouse mansion, and crawled inside just as another rain shower began.

The Appalachian Trail provided us safe passage over two towering mountains. Off we trekked down the steep, Blue Mountain to conquer Rocky Mountain and Tray Mountain for today’s adventures.

Trivia: Do you know why it’s called Rocky Mountain. . .because it’s a ROCKY MOUNTAIN!

The Appalachian Trail provided sweet distractions from the terrain with unusual lovely mushrooms, dainty colorful flowers, centipedes, millipedes, snails of all sizes, a survey marker that we giggled & danced around, bees buzzing as they flew from flower to flower collecting pollen, a honeybee swarm, honey bee in Sugar Gals hair (Oh My!), and chatty hikers like Hiya, Jamie, OU Again, Matthew, and Major.

Tray Mountain was windy, so our socks flapping on the back of our packs are dry and ready for tomorrow’s rain. The pleasant terrain was a little different. . .gentle ups at times and steep at other times, but not too rocky.

Then we got to Tray Gap — our entertainment of the day! Our parents taught us to be nice to everyone and assist & show sympathy to those in need. Things change on the Appalachian Trail, and it gives you fair warning. There are signs saying don’t drive your vehicle on this dirt road; Guthooks and the AT Guide say ‘No, No, You Big Dummy!’ So, we were huffing and puffing hiking the trail when we heard a truck driving on the dirt road parallel to the trail. We started giggling. The truck hit a bump and we giggled more remarking that he is not coming up here. The truck bottoms out and we giggled harder. The truck engine revved, tires spinning, and we were hanging onto the nearest tree, dying with laughter. We trekked on to the shelter, conquering both mountains, as he called a wrecker service to pull the truck back down the mountain.

The stuck truck got no empathy from us today! We lay our weary heads on our pillows, giggling that the Appalachian Trail throws everything that your parents taught you out the tent door, while owls agreed, chattering a sweet good night to us!!","Blue Mountain Shelter, Georgia

After the storms of yesterday, rays of sunshine lit the Appalachian Trail’s floor to show us the way on this beautiful morning. The terrain was rocky at times, yet we huffed and puffed our way through the steep inclines. Hiking Kelly Knob was the highlight of our adventures as Swamp Irish blew his Ron whistle & Sugar Gal exclaimed, “Woohoo!” upon reaching flat terrain, then giggled. We pondered, is Kelly Knob a knob, a hill, a bump, or a mountain? Whatever it is, we loved it! The Appalachian Trail loves to present mystical moments on the trail like colorful mushrooms, breathtaking flowers, odd creatures, sparkling mica sprinkled on the trail floor, and unusual shaped trees that are twisted and hollow.

A father (Huckleberry) and daughter (7 Sisters) whizzed past us giggling. They came and went so quickly!

Gracie shuttled hiker Snazzy and us back to the trail head at about 11:30 as we exchanged adventures, giggling while listening to the song American Pie on the radio. Hiker stories are much like fish stories. . .they seem to get bigger and bigger.

The Appalachian Trail granted us an easy day of trekking with gentle ups and downs, giant flower mushrooms & small brightly colorful mushrooms, rhododendron flowers, unique dainty flowers, snails, slugs, squirrels, and fluttering butterflies.

Upon arriving at Plumorchard Gap Shelter, we deciding to trek farther because it was still early in the day and hikers Daisy and Log informed us that Wizard (a hiker living in the shelter) was there. We giggled and continued our trek.

After last night’s rains, the streams are flowing freely, so water was not an issue when we needed to replenish. Onward we trekked until. . .is that a sick chipmunk lying in the middle of the trail? Sugar Gal, stepped over the chipmunk and around the root. . .make that a rattlesnake. It curled up and started rattling! SNAKE!!!! Swamp Irish came to her rescue and pushed the snake off the trail with a long tree branch! Off scampered the chipmunk. Our awesome adrenaline started flowing freely like a rushing stream.

Happy 4th of July!!!! Our day was filled with laughter!

Today, the Appalachian Trail was celebrating the 4th by showing off with sounds of rushing mini waterfalls down the many streams and trees that blocked the trail causing us to duck (head bangers), jump (knee knockers), go around (road blockers), or climb over them (shin shakers). There was an obstacle course mountain with rocky terrain for a mile on the way up and easy trekking on the way down. It was cool and Swamp Irish sang while doing trail maintenance like removing dead trees from the trail. The saga continues. . .he asked, “Does a bear poop in the woods?” No. . .he poops on the trail like the dogs. . .and we giggled!! So much for the 200 feet rule!
We noticed that the foliage was unusually green. The Luck of the Irish continues today! Swamp Irish spied a leprechaun on the Appalachian Trail which made us giggle!

The Appalachian Trail terrain was extremely steep and slippery, so we called it the Max Capacitor. We navigated slippery mud, rocks, and roots while it sent us sliding at warp speed in the Twilight Zone of fog, with very low visibility. Wet terrain from last night’s rain, filled with large flat rock fields, meant we’d go flat on our tushys if we weren’t careful. As a surprise, the trail graced us with a jewel of a spider web.

Hiker Data Queen was one of many trail maintenance volunteers we met working on the trail, making repairs on steep steps along this treacherous climb.

Getting a little tired, we arrived at a stealth site, so we immediately started setting up the townhouse tent. Sugar Gal got in just as the rain started.

It’s foggy and cool this morning, giving the trail an eerie feeling, but the fog quickly moves on as do the. . .Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti, Doe, a deer, a female deer. . .make that two of them running across the trail. We scared them as much as they scared us! We giggled, trekking onward discovering that wild hogs have been digging up the Devils Tater Patch and tearing up the terrain. Guess they’re looking for taters.

We paused on our trek to giggle and chat with a newbie hiker wearing an orange rain jacket. . .Orange Man, Everett, Orange Newt, Eye of Newt. . .we’ll figure out a name for him later. He had gotten lost the first day (yesterday) on the trail, so he stopped to chat the second day (today), picked our hiker brains at lunch, and camped with us at Russell Field Shelter. We love meeting young kids, fresh out of college, ready to conquer the Appalachian Trail!

What is with the rain??? Oh yes, we are in the Great Smoky Mountains!!! We snuggled into our dry cozy sleeping quilts, giggling that the Appalachian Trail will allow us to dry out one day!!","Birch Spring Tent Site, North Carolina

The Appalachian Trail wanted us to go slow today! The day starts foggy with a chance of rain, so on go our backpack covers, making it easy to suit up at a moment’s notice. Did you know that there are three similar sounds on the trail? Listen carefully and pay attention; wind rustling in the trees above, trickling streams, and rainfall that must fill the canopy of trees before it starts to get you soaking wet. We trekked on good terrain that reminded us of the Grayson Highlands at times with flowing ups and downs, switchbacks for ease, breathtaking sun rays, honeybees collecting pollen from every flower, birds singing (like a flute with a stick in it to change the tune), survey markers, evidence of hogs rooting up the forest floor, deer scampering off onto the woods, and a piped spring for water.

The watering hole at Beechnut Gap had awesome water with two piped streams, while a host of hikers (High Stepper, Mugs, Rocket Man & IPA, & Tee-Newt) gathered to replenish their water supply, giggled, and exchanged terrain information.

Trekking on, we hopped over rocks and steps as we sang, “And when you’re only in between, you’re neither up nor down!” As the terrain worsened, the bottom fell from the sky without warning, causing the trail to fill with rain water, becoming a flowing stream. So much for soaking up vitamin D from the sunshine! Now we’re soaking wet!

The shelter was the perfect place to dry out and set up for the evening. We giggled as Santa Claus trekked through camp, checking on his good little girls and boys! Yes, even Santa hikes the Appalachian Trail!! Caption Jack drifted into camp at dusk and the giggling started again as he introduced himself to Tee-Newt. (Our orange creature is delighted with his new trail name!)

Owls chattering are our alarm clock in the Smokies, beginning a sunshiny day complete with sunburst shining through the trees, cool air, and no gnats. Yea!! When the Appalachian Trail bestows upon you a beautifully delightful day like today, it really does it up right with unusual mushrooms, flamboyant flowers, intricately woven spider webs, a precious baby bird perched on a limb while learning to fly, hog wallows, a hog trap with no hog, animal tracks of all kinds in the mud, survey markers, and black & white butterflies that twirled when they flew. We took advantage of the warm sunshine when we arrived at the shelter by removing our shoe insoles to allow them to dry in the sun!

Double Spring Gap Shelter Trivia:  The shelter is in Tennessee.  The spring water source, a few feet away, is in North Carolina.  The Appalachian Trail meanders along the North Carolina – Tennessee borders in The Great Smoky Mountains.

We had the opportunity to chat and giggle with hikers Fletch, Pacer, Jennie & Flower Power - Trail Angels baring candy (we taught Tee-Newt to graciously accept Trail Magic as he giggled), The Finger Pointer Family (with Antonio, they were Trail Angels baring carrots, candy, and sausage), Captain Jack, and Tee-Newt.

A Park Ranger Trail Runner arrived at the shelter near dusk, checking permits as she made sure everyone hung backpacks & food, and gave warning of the wild hog activity in the area after dark.

This raises the question: Are you afraid of the dark or what’s in the dark?

Swamp Irish is afraid of the dark, but the door zipper on our townhouse tent keeps us safe from the great abyss of darkness and hogs! He once beat his dog back home, running faster than the dog after feeding the family’s hogs at night and hearing nightly noises. Needless to say, we zipped the tent tight!!!

Today, day hikers filled the trail, giggling as they trekked to Siler Bald, which isn’t a bald. We also giggled because we couldn’t convince them there was no bald, giggling even more as they grumbled on the way back down the mountain. . .because there was no bald!!! LOLFOF

The Appalachian Trail bid Tee-Newt farewell with a cool morning. We had wished him good luck last night as he would be departing the trail.

Today, we are on an all-time high trekking to Clingmans Dome, the 200 mile mark going northbound and the highest point on the Appalachian Trail. Terrain was rocky and steep at times for the first 5 miles. Then, there was easy trekking for the rest of the day except for one short steep climb near the day’s end. There were many old dead trees covered with green moss (a new flower for us), bright orange tiger lilies sprinkled along the trail, decorative mushrooms, AT carved in fallen logs, and round log stepping stones. We danced across the TN/NC state line at Newfound Gap, then off to climb rock and root sculptured steps as white blazes strategically placed along the trail guided the way.

Little Hawk, Quinn & Makaylaa, Nick & Molly, and Darkness all found a resting place for the night at the lovely scenic shelter. And yes, the water was a short stroll to an ice water piped spring!

If you hadn’t guessed it by now, Captain Jack was the last to arrive. Everyone giggled that the Appalachian Trail watches over its hiker children, making sure they’re safely tucked away at the end of a hard trekking day!!","Double Spring Gap Shelter, Tennessee

We often hear hikers say they will wake up early to go watch the sunrise. Not going to happen! The Appalachian Trail had other things in mind for us today. Swamp Irish stepped out of our townhouse tent and jumped back in yelling, “Get your phone! You will want a picture of this!!” There, before our very eyes, was the most beautiful sunrise we had ever seen. The excitement spread like wildfire as everyone at the shelter giggled, admiring it’s beauty! We were like the paparazzi snapping pictures of the gorgeous sunrise.

Finally, off we trekked the steep, but pleasant terrain on a ridge with mountains on both sides allowing lovely views when the foggy clouds lifted. We were ridge runners on narrow ridges with nothing on either side of the trail, just drop offs, discovering a worm looking lizard snake thingy. Got That!?!?

We met several hikers who shared their adventures: Puddles, Hunter from REI and his adventure group, No Polls from India, Trail Brat, Journey Man Jim, High Stepper, Quick Step, and late arrival Captain Jack.

North Carolina is known for a state rich in mica. We trekked, discussing the sparkle in the dirt, then climbed twinkling rocks and dirt near the Mt. Sequoyah summit, and spied a message just for us. 1,200 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced over the sparkling dirt, making sure to take pictures!

Hickory Fairies near Wayah Gap must have passed the word to the Mica Fairies near Mt. Sequoyah that we would be celebrating 1,200 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail! Mica Fairies’ cheeks and hair twinkle with sparkling mica as they sweetly left us a spectacular mica message! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with an easy terrain of ridges.

Today was a special day jammed with many amazing adventures on the Appalachian Trail as the shelter filled with hikers giggling and sharing their exciting day! You never know what magical wonders await you.

Due to excessive bear activity, hikers are required to stay at shelters. However, a few of the shelters in the Great Smoky Mountains are closed due to bear incidents, causing us to have to hike long distances. Today was an easy flat terrain most of the day with long distance step downs created by Trail Maintenance Angels. We enjoyed the sweet smell of pine, exotic giant mushrooms, survey markers, breathtaking flowers, decorative snails, and mushrooms along the path in the green foliage.

It’s starting to rain! I slipped on a wet root, falling on my bottom! Oh Dear, Guthooks says we missed our trail! Turn around! Dang! I’m wet from the downpour and the river running through the trail! Hike faster to get to the shelter! Just as fast as the rain started, it stopped. Yay!! We reached the shelter only to discover that the bears weren’t in cages, but we would be. Davenport Gap Shelter is famous for its gate-front fence, a caged wall that keep hikers safe and bears out. Now, that gives a whole new meaning to Gated Community!

We love it when we meet wise hikers who share their wise wisdom. The Priestess shared massaging feet and legs before going to sleep for a more relaxing night. . .it works!!! Hikers are so smart!

We drifted off to sleep, relaxing to the sounds of barred owls (who, who, who cooks for you!?), rain frogs croaking, and lightning bugs twinkling in the dark sky.

Heading to Newport, we said goodbye to the enclosed shelter with a gate-front fence, the crawfish that lives in the stream, the crow that bids us farewell, and the majestic Smoky Mountains.

The terrain was easy downward trekking to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park border, where we deposited our departure permit. Streams flowed along the pathway, a tiny orange snake slithered down the path, and flowers of great 
splendor adorned the trail. The Appalachian Trail has a way of capturing a hiker’s soul and holding it close while keeping one safe. Every once in a while a part of the Appalachian Trail is closed to keep hikers safe, and for the moment, due to aggressive bear activity, hikers are strongly asked not to camp or hike a portion of the trail. We will be safe from harm while Nate (hiker Zach) (817-239-4266) shuttles us into town to recharge.

Birds sang, calling us back to the Appalachian Trail. So we giggled, dried our townhouse tent, packed up our treasures, and returned to the Appalachian Trail. Max Patch had happy hikers of all sizes viewing gorgeous mountain ranges as they walked a meadow of dainty flowers.

The terrain was pleasant.  We trekked alongside rushing streams, dainty flowers, colorful mushrooms, cattle fence crossings, many stealth sites, crawling centipedes, and soon-to-be-ripe blackberries.

We also spied under a hollow tree: Norman Gnome mining mica while Darryl Sasquatch helped as Freddy Frog looked on causing us to giggle.

Upon arriving at the shelter, we were excited to see new bear bag cables. After we hung our food bags, we giggled because the Appalachian Trail bear cables made life easy. Swamp Irish was happy that he didn’t have to throw the rock bag to hang our food safely!!","USFS 148A, Newport, North Carolina

Several hikers on the trail whizzed around us so they could make it into Hot Springs, NC before it was too late.

The Appalachian Trail’s mouse alarm clock woke us up right on time. . .5 o’clock sharp! That’s an alarm that is quite alarming, sending us packing in no time at all!!

There was excitement in the air as we are headed to town! We trekked past a family grave site, through downed trees blocking the trail using roundabouts and climbing over them, took pictures of unusual mushrooms, saw no flowers, and trekked straight down going into Hot Springs.

Swamp Irish spied Sugar Gal through the trees and blew his whistle after rounding a switchback. We giggled, starting a game of Peek-a-boo as we trekked.

Arriving in Hot Springs (the Appalachian Trail meanders through the town), we discovered all of the hostels and hotels were booked, so we decided to grab a bite to eat and continue our adventures on the trail. The Appalachian Trail provides for its own! As we trekked through the town, hiker Captain Jack crossed paths with us and informed us that the Tavern had an available room, but we must be there when they opened. So off we trekked to the tavern for 11 o’clock. Hot Springs is a happy little town. Visitors to the town kept asking where were the hot springs and locals would giggle answering, “There are none.” We found this amusing and so did whittler, Santa Claus.  So. . .“Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus.

We made an executive decision to sleep in late this morning. . .a whole hour. Off we trekked along the French Broad River to the sounds of the rushing river as it echoed off of Lover’s Leap Rock.

The trek up the mountain gave us one last view of the town. We hiked the steep ups with rock boulder climbing and a reprieve now and then of flat trail.

Day hikers from Colombia, Florida, Michigan, and the local area stopped to giggle and chat, sharing upcoming terrain information.  Meeting up with trail maintenance volunteers, we thanked them for their trail improvements.

Our last 3 miles of trekking included easy flows of ups and downs with flowers that lined the path and a harmless snake that slithered away into the foliage.

The gnats were so bad that the moment we arrived at the shelter on a secluded tentsite we built our first campfire on the Appalachian Trail. Let’s sit around the campfire telling hiker stories!

Ahh, yes! We will be going down most of the day! The Appalachian Trail gave us a delightful trek of downs to start the day filled with plentiful stealth sites, unique mushrooms, colorful dainty flowers, camouflage frogs, slugs, snails, snakes, turtles and 3 baby bears. . . ‘No, not bears!!!’ They were cute, curious, playful, and at a distance. The real danger was we didn’t see momma bear, so we trekked down the trail very quickly.

We crossed paths with Captain Jack again on his way to get water near an irate landowner’s home who is known for his dislike of hikers. We took the time to share our latest adventures and parted ways, giggling when we heard dogs barking in the distance at Captain Jack going to and coming from the water source. Later in the day, we crossed paths again. The landowner stopped him from getting water and made him pour the water out. Then the landowner asked Captain Jack to come to the house and get fresh clean water. We giggled at his story. It is always a pleasure to chat with him.

We were awakened by the Appalachian Trail’s singing bird alarm clock. We had hung our food on bear cables at the shelter last night and with great success, no bears ate our food. Dang!!! A mouse chewed a little hole in our bear bag! Let’s seal the hole with Leukotape. The Appalachian Trail is full of surprises. Now we have to outsmart the mice!!!

The morning terrain was a steep upward climb for the first couple of miles. So the Appalachian Trail awarded us easy downs, slow moving snails, dark rhododendron alleys, light fog, a rainbow of colorful butterflies, wild turkeys, pancake-shaped mushrooms, AT markings, deer tracks, and we don’t know what the other track was. . .mountain lions?!?

The terrain became steep at times, so we huffed and puffed as we trekked upward over rock fields and roots. This caused for drastic measures. Doing the butt wiggle, we raised our shoulders, moving our packs upward on our backs, and leaned forward slightly. This made us giggle as we trekked up Big Butt Mountain. We trekked and trekked until. . .ouch, my feet hurt! We paused to rest on rock chairs with cushions (mossy coverings).

At the end of the day, we found the nicest, grassy, stealth site, so we made an executive decision to call it a day, set up camp, cook a yummy supper, and hang bear bags. Don’t worry! We used our hiker brain hanging a sturdy plastic bag over the bear bags to fight off mice and rain. We’ll let you know how that works out! Snuggled in our cozy townhouse tent and listening to thunder in the distance, we giggled, discussing that maybe the Appalachian Trail should rename Big Butt Mountain to Bertha. . .one of the Butt sisters!!

The gentle rain from last night did not last long. The Appalachian Trail graced us with a cool morning, dry trail, and dry food bags. Ah yes, the stealth site had no bears, coyotes, snakes, or mice as we had been warned by hikers on Guthooks. The Appalachian Trail wanted to make sure we were awake, hence the biting bugs and stinging nettles. By the time we arrived at Shelton Graves Memorial and Campsite, the little pests were gone. We paid our respects and trekked a peaceful easy trail with vibrant orange tiger lilies and mushrooms, spider web necklaces AT style (they catch you around the neck), little snake lizard thingys jumping on his hind legs off the trail like he’s flying, turkeys gobbling, chickens clucking, and dogs barking in the distance.

Hikers Mouse & Montreal stopped to chat. So that’s who’s been getting into our food!! We giggled, trekking onward.

We were playing Switchback Peek-a-boo and giggling when we rounded the bend trekking into Hogback Ridge Shelter and spied a message just for us. 1,300 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced around the moss-covered log while taking pictures!

Sparkling Mica Fairies near Mt. Sequoyah took a day off to pass the word to the Yellow Fairies at Hogback Ridge Shelter that we would be celebrating 1,300 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail! Now the Yellow Fairies giggled as they flew away because one of their Fairies is color blind and placed an orange leaf on their yellow masterpiece as they sweetly left us a spectacular yellow message!

I see daylight! We’re almost at the top of the mountain. Oh shucks, the trail curved and went to the dark side, making us giggle. . .more up. Bummer!

As we weaved in and out, crossed the Tennessee/North Carolina state line and sang silly songs, the Appalachian Trail distracted us with a hovering helicopter, AT carvings in logs, and survey markers. There were white blazes on trees, sticks, and rocks to guide us through the different types of terrain.

Big Bald & Big Stamp were balds with breathtaking views, trekking rolling terrain through fields of colorful flowers. It felt more like a stroll through the movie “The Sound of Music” and made us giggle as we enjoyed that warm fuzzy feeling.

Wait! Stop the Presses! Hundreds of ripe blueberries made us giggle even more! So we picked blueberries, ate blueberries, and saved blueberries for later, singing ‘Blueberry Hill.’

The Appalachian Trail, in all its wisdom, decided to grace us with a nice trail today. The terrain was a little steep at times with a few places where the trail was deteriorating to a very narrow path, but we managed just fine.

Swamp Irish was the leader, so he was the Spider Fighter while doing a little trail maintenance! Now, hikers can do only so much before it comes to a point when a downed tree across the trail causes them to scratch their heads and use their hiker brains. So, do a roundabout, cross over the log and then a crossover, a halfway roundabout, halfway over the log. . .are you confused yet?! Problem solved as you trek onward.

We sang ‘Feeling Groovy’ as we trekked downhill while admiring the lush green foliage with colorful mushrooms sprinkled every now and then, dainty flowers, and stealth sites along the trail.

Are we going north or south? According to the compass, we are going in the wrong direction. So AWOL tries to straighten out the confusion. The Appalachian Trail loves to give you a brain teaser just for the fun of it! Hikers Gandalf, Snakeman, and Doug giggled at the confusion also.

We arrived at Uncle Johnny’s, where they fed us ice cream then referred us to Doug at 423-270-9775 (nice, quick, inexpensive) for a shuttle into Erwin, Tennessee. Doug shuttled us to Super 8 (awesome place, clean, cheap laundry, and yummy breakfast)! We highly recommend both!

Today’s terrain consisted of rocks, roots, and a deteriorating trail that slanted down off the side of the mountain ridge. There was only a mile of good hiking today. It makes you appreciate it when the Appalachian Trail gives you good terrain that is not dangerous. But the Appalachian Trail distracted us with footbridges over cascading streams, flat stealth sites, colorful mushrooms, Trail Magic hot sauce, beautiful foliage, wiggly creatures, 1 Daddy Long Legs, an Eagle Scout Project from Troop 4 in Tennessee, and AT markings on fallen trees.

Speaking of trees. . .hug a tree has a whole new meaning on the Appalachian Trail. . .to climb out of the tent, you hug a tree. To stop yourself as you’re going downhill, you hug a tree. When climbing over a fallen tree, you hug a tree. When handrails are needed, you hug a tree. When you stumble over a rock, you hug a tree. Forget hugging a tree if you’re lost; check your Guthooks! We giggle because we look like monkeys. . .hugging trees.

Last night, we heard turkeys and coyotes and bears, Oh My! Never mind, scratch the bears.

The Appalachian Trail gifted us with a cool light rain in the morning and a nice trail that was very well maintained, making the terrain trekking extremely easy even in the rain.

As you may have guessed, there is never a dull moment on the Appalachian Trail, and today’s excitement began before dawn with an alarm clock of a nearby owl convention. So, up we got and off we trekked on easy going terrain of breathtaking flowers, colorful mushrooms, sunbeam showers, unique foliage, unusual staircases, switchbacks, and odd grating embedded in the path to prevent slipping when it rains.

Our adventures led us to the Cloudland Hotel Site where the parking area had a real live bathroom complete with toilet paper (a luxury), real live water fountains to replenish our water bottles, and real live trashcans to dispose of our stinky hiker trash! Yay!! By the way, the site once housed an elegant hotel.

The trek to Roan Mountain Shelter was easy with lots of switchbacks. However, the terrain turned to horrible little rocks for the next 2 miles.

The Appalachian Trail then graced us with easy trekking over Jane Bald where we dined on yummy blueberries. The path sparkled like diamonds and was lined with vibrant red, yellow, and white flowers guiding the way to Stan Murray Shelter where we found a flowing piped spring with icy water.

Today’s trek gives a whole new meaning to having her head in the clouds. It was foggy all day as we trekked Hump Mountain.

The young whippersnapper hikers we met last night only trekked a short distance (less than ½ mile) to a stealth site instead of their planned 5 miles. We all giggled, named them the Lollipop Kids, they offered us Starbucks coffee, and off we trekked. Later in the day, they passed us thanking us for their new trail name.

It was cold and windy on top of the bald, very much like the Grayson Highlands when the winds blow you down. So we sang, “Way aye blow the man down!” We giggled, struggling to remain in the upright position as we trekked like drunken hikers.

The Appalachian Trail graciously provided a little rock climbing over mini boulders, did a little rock hopping, and long bald crossings. The bald’s path was filled with beautiful colorful wildflowers, juicy berries, bees gatherings nectar, butterflies fluttering, and birds singing happily.

Once off the bald and into the trees, the trail darkened like walking at nighttime under a cloudy sky with a heavy canopy of trees. The entire day was in and out of dark canopy tunnels. At the end of the tunnels was a light of white noise nothingness (dense fog) in fields of flowers.

We paused on our trek to chat and giggle over if we were in North Carolina or Tennessee with hikers, X and his muzzled dog Z, Bandana, Coup, and Optimistic Dreamer.

Arriving at Station 19E Hostel, we ate yummy food, showered, washed out stinky clothes, booked a flight to Maine, and giggled over the Appalachian Trail age factor to Katahdin! We are basing these findings from a seasoned hiker's informal survey while trekking the trail.

Age 50 or above logic shows of those who trek to Hot Springs will make it to Katahdin because the body hasn’t given out thus far.  Age 30 and under may not make it because their diverted mind gives up.  Age 30-50. . .we have no idea. Guess they are still wandering around in the woods of the Appalachian Trail!! LOLFOF

We slack packed 13.9 miles to the symphony of woodpeckers pecking for food, tweedledee birds singing, and waterfalls flowing in the distance. The terrain was an easy trail due to no pack, trekking on a pine straw carpeted trail, and the sweet smell of pine that made us giggle.

Near Mountaineer Falls, we spied a gnome village for good luck! The falls had been diverted so that hikers could shower. . .an awesome idea, so the gnomes moved in.

After the falls, the trail followed a tranquil trickling stream as we sang the song “Best I Ever Had” by Gary Allan . The path led us up and down mountains, complete with switchbacks going round and round. Today included a very pleasant walk through the woods with toe tipper trippers, ear cleaner limbs, and squeaking trees in the breeze. From there, we trekked along a river through an open field of flowers, mushrooms, butterflies, and survey markers.

Hikers Just Chris, Dave, New Angel, Wrestle, Doc, Henry, Bandana, and Not Today also enjoyed the easy terrain.

At the end of the day, we giggled with our feet hanging off of the bed. The Appalachian Trail’s sense of humor did not short sheet us but instead short bedded us!!!

Rise & Shine, Sunshine! It’s a beautiful day, and Dave is ready to bring us to the trailhead, so we bid farewell to Henry, Bandana, and Anna. Our goal is to trek an easy 13 miles according to AWOL.

Trekking the smooth trail with few rocks inspired Swamp Irish (The Bionic Man) to do trail maintenance by knocking dead trees down and pulling big limbs off the trail. However, he did not kick the Bear Poop off the trail, but instead stepped over, warned Sugar Gal, and trekked on, giggling.

We found the Wiley Coyote rock that balanced on a tiny stone, ready to fall at the slightest touch, all the while listening to planes flying overhead, birds singing, streams trickling, and woodpeckers foraging for food.

Hiker Bugs paused from his busy day to giggle and share upcoming terrain.

Sugar Gal took a tumble on a smooth trail with 1 tiny rock. Who put that rock there??? The Appalachian Trail giggled, waking her up so she could enjoy the adventures that lay ahead!

The Appalachian Trail has a way of guiding you to where you need to be when you’re tired. Today it was to the loving arms of Kincora, where we would meet the amazing Mr. Bob! Your kindness will never be forgotten!!

We soon came to a stretch of well maintained trail when we spied a message just for us. 1,400 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced around the leaf, taking pictures!

Yellow Fairies near Hogback Ridge Shelter took time out of their busy schedule to pass the word to the Flower Field Fairies near Kincora that we would be celebrating 1,400 miles of hiking! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with an easy terrain and beautiful blue butterflies fluttering from flower to flower.

Today was an extraordinary day filled with many amazing adventures on the Appalachian Trail! You never know what magical wonders await you. We giggled and drifted off into a sweet peaceful slumber at Kincora with raccoons dining outside our door to celebrate our 1,400 miles and 200th day on the Appalachian Trail!!","Station 19E Hostel, Tennessee

We left the Kincora Hiking Hostel to trek a tourist trail. Nice! Sweet! Dude! Oh yes, the Appalachian Trail graced us with an easy trek. . .for a while.

Ok, who put these steps here? Can you guess the magic number? Sugar Gal thought she would count this staircase masterpiece of 366 steps to Laurel Falls. The rushing creek followed a narrow ridge trail as yellow and blue butterflies led the way to our destination. Along the way we stopped to chat with hiker Not Yet, heard a tree fall that saddened our hearts, were scared by a grouse that flew away-loudly fluttering its wings, saw AT markings on fallen trees, witnessed a bear scampering away, crossed footbridges, and trekked over the Wilbur Dam. We arrived at a stealth site past the dam, set up our townhouse tent, and cooked supper as frogs, crickets, and cicadas started to chat at dusk.

We giggled, recalling day hikers who passed us during the day. They smelled sweet and after they passed, that sweet smell lingers in the Appalachian air!!","Mr. Bob Peoples’ Kincora Hiking Hostel, Tennessee

The Appalachian Trail’s alarm clock included birds singing, boats roaring on the lake, and weekend campers having fun at nearby campsites. On this cool morning, our trek was easy terrain, decorated with AT markings on downed trees, creatively made steps, breathtaking orange spider lilies sprinkled beside the trail, a vole eating (What in the world is a Vole?), woodpeckers tapping, and raccoons washing their hands before they eat. . .Amen!

We paused on our trek to chat and giggle with hikers Crabapple and Bible about upcoming terrain. Onward we trekked as the skyline darkened. . .you guessed it. . .the bottom fell from the sky, pouring rain on us for an hour. With rain came strikes of lightening, then loud crackles of thunder. Just as fast as the storm came, it left us soaking wet and soggy shoes. What do you do? Giggle, making sure you step in every mud puddle on the flowing river referred to as the Appalachian Trail!

We set up our townhouse tent near the shelter as the drizzling rain began again. We cooked and ate yummy soup indoors and giggled, thanking the Appalachian Trail for delaying the rain a few moments before drifting off into a peaceful slumber!!","Stealth Site 432.1 Mile Marker, Tennessee

Birds are singing, the sun is shining, and a rooster is crowing! That can only mean one thing. . .the rain is over. The Appalachian Trail is giving us a spectacular day to hike even though our shoes are soaked and we are low on water. We discovered the campsite stream was dry and all we have is 1 cup of water to trek 4 miles, but that did not stop us from visiting the monument to Nick Grindstaff, a loner. The Appalachian Trail has a funny sense of humor, so it provided us with easy terrain, a cool morning, and plump juicy blackberries to feast upon and quench our thirst before arriving at a flowing stream.

Our last peak in this southern section (1,432 miles) of the Appalachian Trail made for a very emotional day as we arrived at the kiosk at the end of our trek. Swamp Irish walked to the other side of the trail, into the meadow filled with flowers, and to the parking lot where they carefully placed Sugar Gal in the ambulance this past May. Speaking softly we thanked all who helped save a hiker’s life.

We left Trail Magic fuel for a hiker since you can’t take fuel on the plane. Uncle Mike shuttled us through Elizabethton sightseeing, refused to leave us at the hotel we chose (not a good place), made a Walmart stop, and placed us at a safe haven in Johnson City. Thanks, Uncle Mike!

After we ate, showered, washed clothes, and climbed into a cozy bed, we giggled because the Appalachian Trail had sent Uncle Mike to take exceptional care of its hikers!!","Iron Mountain Shelter, Tennessee

Dang it! TSA did not frisk Swamp Irish who has a metal knee, but instead frisked Sugar Gal who had no metals on her person and then took her peanut butter for the trail, leaving her Chocolate Chip Cookies! We giggled, thinking they really missed out — Chocolate Chip Cookies taste better!!!

It is hard to practice social distancing with 100 people at your gate.

After settling in we showered, washed clothes, walked the tiny town of Monson, signed up for Katahdin at the ATC by Brad, and picked up supper at the general store. Poet and Brad gave us tons of information about our upcoming trek through the 100 Mile Wilderness, food pickups, registration to hike Katahdin, and the best trails to trek Katahdin. Should I be writing this down! And oh yeah, Maine is known for its Moose!

Poet fed us a fabulous breakfast and sent us on our way to slack pack 12 miles. . .11 of which were the Appalachian Trail. We are so excited to trek the easy 100 Mile Wilderness in Maine!

Hikers exchanging information at the hostel were Afternoon Cowboy, Greg, Research, Calypso, Tip Crusher, Buttercup, Italian, Mimi, Renegade, Faithful, Surfer, Tractor, Fin (manager of Gooder Grove Hiker Hostel in Franklin, NC), and many more.

The Appalachian Trail introduced us to a terrain that began with an easy trail of wet rocks, roots, black water streams running alongside the trail, AT survey markers, lots of rollercoaster hills, more huge slippery roots, rock climbing, boulder climbing, blueberries to munch on, crickets that click when they fly, loons at the ponds, hanging trees that combed your hair, and. . . What time is it? Did you pack a flashlight? Pull out your phone — it’s getting dark! Call Poet! But Poet, you know we only walk 1 mile an hour!!

Our phone flashlights got us through the last hour of trekking an easy dark trail. Poet picked us up and we all giggled because we were lightning bugs hiking the 100 Mile Wilderness on the Appalachian Trail!!

Hippie Chic assisted us with our food drop off. We chose a midway point so that we did not have to carry 10 days of food. Off to a late start, we trekked muddy terrain that included huge rocks and roots. The Appalachian Trail distracted us with chipmunks scampering in the forest along the stream and unique mushrooms waiting for the paparazzi to take their photographs. . .that would be Sugar Gal.

We giggled when we came to a sign that said follow the arrow to Trail Magic. That is the best way to get a hiker’s attention and whet a hiker’s appetite. We followed the arrow to the most delicious hot dogs, grilled corn, chips, Oreos, and cold drinks. The sign also informed us where to find water. We passed the word of both treasures.

Hikers 2 Slow, Turtle, Simple Lot, Bam Bam, Digger, and Mess were also delighted to learn of our findings.

After hiking 5 hours, we arrived at the shelter the Appalachian Trail bestowed upon us. Let’s call it a day!! That was worth giggling about!!!

We were up early to begin our trek and woodpeckers joined us, tapping on trees to forage for breakfast.

Confusing Facts. . .

Now we have been told that Maine is having a drought, yet we are trekking through mud, wet rocks, and wet roots due to the rains every day. Also, for something that shows flat land on the map, we have not stopped climbing mountains.

Interesting concept, we climbed this mountain with our feet stepping sideways between the wet roots in order to go straight up the mountain.

The Appalachian Trail has entertained us with white blazes that are laying down on the side of the trail, trekked footbridges over bogs, gazed at unique pitcher plants, found a tower, discovered a survey marker, and spotted brownie bites (no make that moose droppings). Put that down, Swamp Irish! It is not edible!!
Someone became very creative when naming the mountains. We crossed 4th Mountain in the Chair Backs. There is 3 1/2 Mountain and 3rd Mountain. Hummm!

It’s National Rock Climbing Day according to the Appalachian Trail and white blazes are suggestions. Since hikers are wise, they find rock scrambles are interesting, tricky, and sketchy. “Which way do we go George?”. . .so they make their own path to climb over the rock scramble and down the mountain. With a sigh of relief, we look back over our shoulders. There it stood — a majestic wall of rock scrambles, so we smile with great respect.

Hikers Siri, Where’s Waldo, Zack For Now, Donkey, Pokey, Chainsaw, and locals paused to giggle while sharing information about upcoming terrain.

The Appalachian Trail placed an AT marking at our feet near a little stealth site on this cold evening for us to lay our weary heads for the night. So we giggled before drifting off into sweet slumber!!

Let’s make it a 15 miler today! That thought went out the window when Swamp Irish looked at AWOL only to find that we were climbing Chair Back Mountain. Our day was filled with trail maintenance stairs, moss growing on everything, camouflaged frogs, scary AT-shaped roots, a privy in the middle of nowhere, and the top of Chair Back Mountain had a skinny ledge of rocks to trek on this cool, sunny day. The skinny ledge of rocks was the tip of the iceberg. Then, there was the Rockslide! Straight down boulder rocks. Sit and slide. Near the bottom of the rockslide was an arrow on the Appalachian Trail sign. I guess some hikers can’t follow directions and turn after the sign. How dingy are they. . .oh yes, that was us! LOLFOF OF ROCKS. Get this. . .other hikers followed us, so we all had to turn around. Darn!

We later giggled singing, “We will gather at the river”. . .make that a stream. We then rock-hopped through the stream. That did the trick because the terrain became an easy smooth trek to the road.

Hikers trekking the Wilderness today were Extra, Snooze, Redhead, and Ms I from Israel.

We stopped for the night at the road and found a nice flat campsite, set up our townhouse tent, ate chicken flavored chicken, climbed into our cozy sleeping quilts, ate 2 candy bars, and giggled that the Appalachian Trail had gotten us safely off Chair Back Mountain!!

We awakened to the nearby rushing stream which will be the perfect place to replenish our water supply. The Appalachian Trail was cold and easy terrain this morning as we approached the White Cap Mountains. All good things must come to an end. We had boulder climbing in the Chair Backs. Well, now there is steep stair climbing in the White Caps. Very tiring to do at the end of the day. Will the huffing and puffing ever end? Yes, when we set up camp for the night.

We also crossed rivers, streams, babbling brooks, rushing water, waterfalls, and trickling water, sprinkling water down the Grand Canyon of Maine.

Hikers eager to take a break, chat, and giggle were Wizard, Beaver, Far Out, Sauce, Robin Ridge Runner, Knew from New Zealand, Tosser, Nemo, Stupid, Bear Spray, and Stop & Go.

Help! Sugar Gal’s Guthooks says we are 26 miles off the trail. Nope! Make that 5 miles. Swamp Irish do you see a white blaze??? Hikers stopped to assist her to no avail. So we followed the white blazes to the next stealth site.

We lay in our warm comfy sleeping quilts, giggling that the Appalachian Trail had brought us back to basics. . .White Blazes!!!

Wow, it’s cold! Do we have to trek this morning with temps in the high 50s? LOL

Off we trekked, looking forward to the light at the end of the tunnel. Oops, it is a false peak because you turn or switch back and continue up the mountain.

Hikers love to giggle and lie, as we all do, including Sergeant, Not Weird, Jerzy, Voodoo, and Spore. Today everything was not BEAUTIFUL! The White Cap Mountains suck. . .too many rocks, too many steps, too many ups, too many downs, and too much steep!

As you trek downward, there are hidden treasures that await you. . .roots and rocks to help you step down, lovely views, moose droppings, aggravating gnats, and carefree rabbits.

Mike from Shaw’s, met us at the roadside for a food drop and informed us of a stealth site shortly up the trail near the pond. . .a peaceful place and great water source.

Our alarm clock was the pitter patter of raindrops on the Appalachian Trail.

The song lyrics of Little Lies by Fleetwood Mac, “tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies” came to mind today. . .hiker lies and giggles came from Cannon Ball, Coyote, Biscuit, Iceman, Oat, Taco, Bird Shit, and others of upcoming terrain. However, it was an easier trekking day.

This is the first day we could look and see the scenery around us because the trail was manageable.

The Appalachian Trail floor is damp from last night’s rain and there are streams flowing across and alongside the path.

We were not in harm’s way so we had time to admire squirrels racing in the woods and the beaver pond that someone had pulled the plug and all the water leaked out. We could hear the sawmill sounds, shotguns shooting, and logging trucks rolling.

Hiker Thoughts: Let’s play, the name the moose poop game, calendar, or a collage with all the poop pics we have taken. If we could only see a moose! We met Mike again at a delivery stop. He is very informative and helpful to hikers on the trail. Oh Wow! Trail Magic! We must have been good little girls and boys! Biscuit fed us well-needed grilled hotdogs and watermelon!!! Biscuit remembered us from Virginia and informed us that if we needed a shuttle, just call. Sweet!
We trekked onward to Antlers Campsite (Mike’s perfect advice). It is Gorgeous! We set up our townhouse tent, prepared supper on the cooking table, dried our gear on rocks and lines, and chatted with hikers Renegade and Faithful.

We giggled when our son helped get our Guthooks up and running. . .Duh! Operator Error! So then we went. . .Skinny Dipping. . .we are now skinny and dipped our hands in the cool water of the pond provided by the Appalachian Trail, rinsing our neckerchiefs!!!

As we left Antlers Campsite, we took one last look across the pond for moose then off we trekked. The Appalachian Trail, filled with green foliage, footbridges, and flat terrain, was rough hiking over rocks and roots. We ate lunch with Faithful and Renegade who invited us to Austin, Texas for BBQ when we’re finished hiking the AT.

We saw squirrels, chipmunks, frogs, loons, and hummingbirds, but still no moose. Hikers Turtle Power and Splinter saw no moose either.

Sunset was breathtaking as we camped on the Nahmakanta Pond. Hikers drifted through, looking for moose and pausing to enjoy the view. Then we spied a message just for us. 1,500 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced near the water’s edge, taking pictures!

Flower Field Fairies near Kincora took a break out of their busy schedule to pass the word to the 100 Mile Wilderness Fairies that we would be celebrating 1,500 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail today! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with an easy terrain and Trail Magic from a local who took our trash, and we giggled!

Today was a special day filled with many amazing adventures on the Appalachian Trail! You never know what magical wonders await you.

Terrain was filled with rocks, mud, bugs, roots, steep ups & downs, and mountain rock ridges. As we trekked, Swamp Irish talked to the birds with his whistle to distract himself from the lack of moose. We also enjoyed frogs, squirrels, woodpeckers, chipmunks, hummingbirds, and streams alongside the path, as did hikers Noah, Turtle Power, Splinter, Lobster, Zolo, and Navigator.

Swamp Irish took a wrong turn so Boo Boo and Hazmat guided him in the right direction. We paused, taking a few minutes to giggle as we discussed the abundance of upcoming blueberries and huckleberries on the Rainbow Ledges. We sought after, found, ate, and collected both berries for breakfast tomorrow.

We camped near the stream, replenished our water supply, cooked supper, carefully put away our luscious berries, and giggled that the Appalachian Trail had provided us with bountiful berries in the Rainbow region!!!

The stream at the shelter put us to sleep last night and served as the Appalachian Trail’s alarm clock, waking us up this morning!

So off we trekked over rolling hills, along huge ponds (we call lakes) noticing beaver lumberjack cut trees, enjoyed a view to Katahdin, and heard a tree fall which saddened our hearts.

Our entertainment of the day was watching a squirrel eat a nut, stick his claws into the log, and wipe his mouth on the greenery growing on the log before scampering away, causing lots of giggles from the peanut gallery (us)!

Now Sugar Gal needs a life. . .she took pictures of roots all day to make a collage of our family roots. . .Alphabet Roots! Hummm. . .is that like the cereal?!?!

Useless Information: The ponds have natural springs in them which cause runoff streams. That’s why the water is warm in the runoff streams. . .it runs through the warm water in the pond. See. . .useless, yet quenches a hikers thirst!

Stopping for lunch to eat ramen noodles and tuna fish, we discovered more blueberries, huckleberries, and popping bugs on the summit of the mountain. We giggled as we ate and gathered berries again for tomorrow’s breakfast.

Southbound hikers Dragon, Tag Along, Jackie O, and Iris arrived at Hurd Brook Lean-To, known for its baseball bat floor (Batter Up!), shortly after us and shared information of their trek to the summit of Katahdin. . .the Big Scary Mountain!

Today is our 11th and final day in the 100 Mile Wilderness of the Appalachian Trail.

We were awakened by loons calling in the distance, telling us it was time to leave the 100 Mile Wilderness. After sleeping in late (an extra 15 minutes), we celebrated our last day of trekking 100 miles by dining on delicious huckleberries, provided by the Appalachian Trail, in our oatmeal while sipping on hot chocolate flavored with Junior Mints.

We bid farewell to the hikers at the shelter and started our final trek in the 100 Mile Wilderness. Today the terrain was an easy level trek with rocks and roots to dance over, admired mossy foliage covered boulders, an extremely loud woodpecker tapping on a nearby tree, no moose (a mythical creature), the babbling melody of Katahdin Streams & Falls in the distance, a soothing sprinkling rain, birds singing, frogs leaping off the trail, and squirrels throwing acorns at us (“Incoming!”).
Useless hiker thought for the day: If you put a brick in a cow’s trough, the cow will eat slower.  Hummmm. . .Useless!

The grand finale was a sign letting us know we were leaving the Wilderness. So we paused to take pictures as we giggled. Let’s Celebrate!

Upon finishing the 100 Mile Wilderness, we stopped at the Abol Bridge Store; ate ice cream, a whoopie pie, a bear claw, candy, and more candy; and giggled with the employees at the store.

Wendy from Wildness Edge Campground shuttled us to a tiny diner to pick up a lobster sandwich (a Maine delicacy). Along the way to the campground, policemen pulled us over for speeding. However, when they saw stinky hikers in the car, they sent us on our merry way. Yea! No ticket! On the lonely Golden Road (96 miles from Millinocket to Canada), a car with a flat tire was causing a traffic jam because so many people had stopped to help hiker Laser fix the flat.

We arrived at the campground, ate, showered, and washed clothes.

I guess it is obvious to others when they encounter a thru-hiker — there is only a backpack (no car or bike) at the picnic table, so people stop to chat. It makes you feel special to be able to share your adventures after an exhausting wilderness trek.

Laser & Emily, hikers enjoying local trails, were Trail Angels who giggled, swapping tall tales of the trail as they fed us a yummy real live cooked supper of chicken, baked beans, zucchini, corn, and onions. We brought to the table, dessert. . .taffy from the camp store. Speaking of the camp store. . .let’s go back for ice cream! We’re Happy Hikers of the Appalachian Trail!!

We may be isolated from the world, but fellow hikers keep each other updated on important weather changes.

Dang! What is with the hurricanes?!?! We can run, or shall I say trek, but we cannot hide from southern hurricanes. The remnants always seem to find us in the northern states. For Pete’s Sake! Hurricane Henri (now just a tropical storm) is headed straight for us. The weather will strand us here another day. . .Yay, a day of rest and relaxation bequeathed by the Appalachian Trail!

This is the deal. . .a thru-hiker may only stay 1 night at the Birches before summiting Katahdin. So, we will be staying put at the Wilderness Edge Campground another day before trekking to the Birches due to the weather from Hurricane Henri.

Hey, let’s do what any smart hiker would do to pass the day while waiting out the rains. . .hitch a ride with Wendy into Millinocket and eat, eat, and eat some more. Only Swamp Irish can stumble upon a Bobcat (skid steer) to pose next to with pride, as Sugar Gal takes his picture.

Now, Millinocket is an odd place (or so we thought). That is where we met Matt & Matilda who tote guns on their hips. Whew! Never mind. They don’t use them on people, only on snakes and dangerous wildlife.

Just to let you know, the people in Millinocket are very observant and love to eavesdrop. After a delicious meal at the Appalachian Trail Café, we began our trek back to the campground when Lisa & Tom (Trail Angels) made the block in their car, picked us up, and brought us safely to the campground. You guessed it! They heard us asking the waitress for directions. Thanks Lisa & Tom!

Later that evening we ordered more food. . .pizza, whoopie pie, and Dr. Pepper from the Katahdin Store. Riesa & David (the little munchkins at the campsite next to us) giggled while enjoying our leftovers that we shared with them.

By the way, Hurricane Henri never made it to Appalachian Trail in northern Maine!!

The pitter-patter of raindrops sent by the Appalachian Trail was our alarm clock. The rain stopped and the winds blew drying our tent townhouse before we started to pack up.

Trail Angel Wendy from The Wilderness Edge Campground shuttled us back to the trailhead at Baxter State Park to register a stay at The Birches Lean-tos & Campsite. (Thanks Wendy!) Usually the rules are simple. Rules are rules. Rules are NOT meant to be broken here! The Birches are for northbound hikers only. So, trek the 100 Mile Wilderness, register at Baxter State Park, trek the last 10 miles to Katahdin Streams Campground, check in at the Ranger Station, trek to the Birches (a shelter/ lean-to at the base of Mount Katahdin for thru hikers before starting their journey), a limit of 12 hikers, and only 1 night is allowed.

We trekked to the park where the Ranger politely asked us not to leave. Sugar Gal glanced at me and began to count the hikers in waiting. . .11, 12, 13, 14. We were 13 and 14. A sick feeling sank on our hearts as she whispered, “Swamp Irish, we will not be trekking to the Birches today. We “missed it by that much!” (Wise words of wisdom from “Get Smart.”)

The Ranger finished his delightful welcome invitation along with the guidelines of the park and path to Katahdin. As the hikers began their trek to the Birches, we giggled and wished them good luck! The Ranger turned to the hikers 11 and 12 (Travis and 2 Strokes) and us with updates that there were no openings at the Abol or Katahdin Springs Campgrounds, but he would contact us if an opening came available.

In all of the information we were given beforehand, no one ever mentioned you must arrive at the entrance with your backpack to begin the trek immediately to the Birches. We certainly didn’t know about this rule, but happened to have our backpacks. Since Travis and 2 Strokes didn’t know about the rule either and since they left their backpacks at the nearby campsite, the Ranger pointed to us and then to the sign in book and said, “You’re 11 & 12.” Given that they were there first, we tried to give up our spots to Travis and 2 Strokes to let them retrieve their packs, but the Ranger let us know that was not allowed. We were in a total state of shock. Our hearts were now filled with great excitement and sadness at the same time. We signed in, wished Travis and 2 Strokes well, and off we trekked to the Birches, giggling.

The Appalachian Trail bestowed upon us a delightful day of easy trekking with gentle slopes along Katahdin Springs & Falls, rushing Niagara Falls, hummingbirds whizzing from flower to flower, ripe blueberry bushes, rocks, roots, campfire rings, a public outhouse/privy, foot bridges over wet paths, and unique mushrooms.

We paused in our trek to chat and giggle with hikers 9 to 5, Hiker, Scout, OJ, No Rush, Bryson, Doc, Maverick, Thor, and 1 Mile. Because it was the last trek before Katahdin, every hiker seemed to admire and appreciate the Appalachian Trail with heightened senses, all the while stopping from time to time to marvel at her beauty.

At Katahdin Springs Campground, we finished our paperwork with the Ranger, received our Yellow Tag (a requirement to hike Katahdin), were reminded to carry and drink lots of water, and picked up a daypack to use while trekking Katahdin the next day. That is when we ran into fellow hiker Not Today whom we had met at Angel’s Rest. As he retrieved his backpack from storage, we congratulated him on completing his trek to Katahdin’s summit. We trekked on to the Birches, giggling and we were sure that if he was back before 3 p m, then we’ve got this. Yeah Buddy, 4 hours up and 4 hours down. . .for us!

We confirmed that the Appalachian Trail has a way of taking excellent care of its hikers when we came across Travis strolling into the Birches from the Blueberry Ledges Trail. He thanked us for our kindness of offering up our spots and let us know that openings became available for them at the Katahdin Springs Campground!

With great joy, everyone at the Birches joined in the celebration, anticipating the final trek on the Appalachian Trail to summit Mt. Katahdin! To celebrate our final trek to the summit, giggling and chatting around the campfire were hikers Birdie, Starburst, Doc, Silly Bandz, Goose, Oatmeal, Lone Wolf, OJ, Bryson, and Studebaker, while munching on Trail Magic provided by Trail Angels!! The Appalachian Trail is filled with unexpected surprises. . .today was overflowing with amazing wonderments!!

Today’s Appalachian Trail alarm clock was pure adrenaline and the excitement as we anticipated the trek to Katahdin. We broke camp in record time, dropped off our backpacks at the Ranger Station, and were the first hikers on the trail before daybreak. We began our ascend of Mount Katahdin at 5 a.m. in the crisp cool air with the smell of pine from the trees as we trekked alongside the rushing springs of the Hunt Trail. With daybreak came hikers. The trail’s terrain was of rocks and root stepping stones. Hikers from the Birches passed us with full packs, never to be seen again. . .we giggled.

The terrain became steeper with larger rocks to climb. Many times, trekking poles were put away as roots, trees, and crevices in surrounding rocks became handrails. At times there was no trail so we did what all wise hikers do. . .scratch our head, look from side to side, then followed other hikers as they trekked triumphantly the trail before us. We giggled, continuing our trek.

With every step or climb, taking us closer to the summit, came a feeling of accomplishment until a family trekked passed us.

The low whisper of the young girl was not a whisper at all but a deafening scream. “I’m scared. I don’t want to do this.”

Mom’s reply was, “You will be happy that you climbed Katahdin.” All trekked onward. The rocks turned into boulders. Strategically placed rungs allowed passage at times. The young girl’s whispers grew piercing as she began to weep loudly. “Please don’t make me do this!” The surrounding hikers helped her up the boulder offering encouragement as we trekked onward, all feeling what she expressed. The treacherous boulders became a test of wills, as hikers helped each other conquer the terrain. It became no man (or woman or child) left behind. We have never witnessed such compassion and self giving. We made it to Tableland with the help of each other, giggled, and paused for snacks/lunch, continuing our trek after a brief rest. The trek to the summit was a relaxing experience from there with many chatty hikers. Thoreau Spring was a mud puddle. We were happy that we had brought plenty of water.

At the summit everyone was giggling and congratulating each other. There were day hikers, section-hikers and thru-hikers. All waiting patiently while the Ranger took pictures as hikers posed at the Northern Terminus sign of the Appalachian Trail. The wind howled, we giggled, we posed, we pondered. For we had made it to the summit of Mount Katahdin! The words of a wise hiker echoed in our ears “Hello Mount Katahdin, My Name Is Tank.” So, we introduced ourselves, giggling, “Hello Mount Katahdin, My Name is Swamp Irish.” “and Mine is Sugar Gal.”","Birches Lean-tos & Campsite, Maine

What goes up must come back down on the Appalachian Trail!!! Let’s see. . .what trail should we take down Katahdin? After weighing our options, we chose the blue blaze Abol Trail. After all, that is the trail the proud young girl and her family chose to descend Katahdin. So for the first half mile we played the game Sit & Scoot over treacherous boulders sliding straight down the mountain as hikers passed us giggling. This is no laughing matter.

A group of hikers waited patiently, dined on snacks as they trailed behind us. We motioned for them to pass noticing one was trekking with only one shoe. When asked about the missing hiking shoe, the giggles started. While on the summit, a strong wind engulfed the hiking shoes of a hiker who was resting her weary feet, whirling them up into the air, tossing one over the steep mountainside, never to be seen again! Her son graciously offered her his hiking shoes, making the descent with one shoe. Now that is truly a Trail Angel! We giggled at their adventures as they passed us, disappearing down into the steep rocky terrain. We were now the last hikers of the day to descend Katahdin.

The terrain gave us a brief flat easy trail of 100 feet, then reared its ugly head! Now we were to follow blue blazes on larger boulder slides and mazes as we continued our descent. However, there were no hikers to follow, so we had to scratch our head, search for the blue blazes by looking in front, from side to side, and behind us. Not only was the treacherous terrain steep but there were millions of little pebbles under our feet causing us to slip. Our hands hurt from gripping rocks on the trek down.

After the first mile and a half, the terrain began to get better but the sun would soon be setting and we were running low on water. Swamp Irish mentioned we started in the dark and we would be ending in the dark. Is anyone listening out there to my moaning and groaning! This trek is as challenging on the way down as on the way up!!

Yay!! The terrain became a trail again with large rocks scattered across the path. Hey, a hiker is resting on a rock! We haven’t seen a hiker in hours. Oh wait, this hiker should be down the mountain. We chatted to discover he was out of and in great need of water. Swamp Irish gave up his water and made sure he was okay. Sugar Gal made him giggle, assuring him that we would inform his wife that he was safe. Off we trekked the easy trail through the dense forest to complete our exciting journey.

Arriving at Abol Campground (after trekking 4.4 miles that you do not get credit), a fellow hiker/Trail Angel gave us water and directed us to the Ranger Station. There we were greeted by Rangers, a search party, and the overdue hiker’s family. We shared information and relieved everyone’s fears that the overdue hiker was safe, in need of water, and gave his location. The rangers arranged for our shuttle driver, Biscuit and Roo Dog, to collect our packs at Katahdin Springs Campground and pick us up to carry us safely to Shaw’s Hiker Hostel. Thanks a million, Biscuit, for taking excellent care of us!!

We giggled with Biscuit as we left the Appalachian Trail for we had just broken the record for hiking Mount Katahdin! 14 hours!!! Longest time ever!!! The giggling continued!

Katahdin is Magical!

We saw a Moose (WOO HOO!! Finally a MOOSE!!! YIPEEE!!!)!! . . .on side of the road, in the dark, on our way to Shaw!!! We giggled!!","Katahdin, Baxter Peak, Northern Terminus of the Appalachian Trail, Maine

We arrived at Shaw’s Hiker Hostel shortly before midnight, set up our tent townhouse, took a quick shower, snuggled into our warm cozy sleeping quilts, and giggled because we had survived Mount Katahdin. It’s terrain included bits and pieces of the entire Appalachian Trail all rolled into one glorious, magical. . .I’m lying. . .make that, technical (some dingy hiker made up that descriptive word). . .mountain!

Let’s take the day off!

In the past, we were advised by many hikers to take the day off from trekking the Appalachian Trail after hiking the treacherous terrain of Katahdin.

The first adventure of the day was Shaw’s Breakfast of Hikers! Shaw chooses and awards a hiker each morning with the coveted Pyramid of Pancakes Award. There doesn’t seem to be a rhyme or reason for the winner. This morning, the award went to Swamp Irish and Sugar Gal for conquering Katahdin! We devoured every morsel after bowing to the applause and giggles! After the Pyramid of Pancakes, you went looking for BBQ.  We headed to the nearest bar. . .Bar-B-Q place, that is. It was the disappointment of the day for Swamp Irish because it was closed! So off we walked, giggling through the town of Monson, stopping at every place we could find to enjoy food. When in town, hikers eat and eat and eat!!!

We spent the day laughing and chatting with hikers Pelican (who posts on TikTok), Swiss, Yeti, Stripper, Unkempt Bed, Jackie O, Poet (shared information on ME and NH), Rocky Too, Nemesis, Full Circle, Crunchy, Super Mom & Super Girl (we had met in Virginia), Aqua Man, Lobster, and many more hikers relaxing at Shaw.

We didn’t deny our inner childhood, for as evening fell we gathered around the campfire, playing guitar and singing. We were sure to sing Happy Birthday to hikers celebrating, followed by more eating and giggling until well after the sun went down!

We drifted off into a sweet slumber to the sounds of giggling, chatty hikers, knowing in our hearts we are all children of the Appalachian Trail, enjoying her whimsical adventures!!!","Shaw’s Hiker Hostel, Maine

Did you hear that? The Appalachian Trail is telling us to take another Zero Day. We’re game! We went to the Post Office to collect our winter gear and new hiking shoes sent from home. My feet are feeling better already!

Enjoyed lunch in the town gazebo.

We were chatting with hikers Buttercup, Bones, Kermit, Explosions, and Mountain Goat (plays musical instruments) when Poet interrupted our free day by suggesting we slack pack a short trek this evening. So off we trekked (in new, comfy hiking shoes) a terrain of light ups, then flat, sometimes rocky, roller coaster bumps. The Appalachian Trail delighted us with red-headed woodpeckers foraging for supper, squirrels scampering, and a slithering snake. We crossed snowboarding trails with no snow, stacks of boards to replace the existing worn boardwalks, and an interesting blue slate quarry.

We returned to Shaw where hikers were sporting Hippie Chick’s loaner clothes, giggling, and telling stories of their trekking travels to Katahdin. Everyone enjoyed a trail magic feast of hamburgers, cookies, brownies, salad, and cold drinks from Trail Angels who came into camp to feed us.

Our alarm clock was quietly chatting hikers packing up their gear to return to the Appalachian Trail. Most were anxiously heading into the 100 Mile Wilderness, concluding their adventure with a trek to the summit of Katahdin.

We enjoyed a delicious breakfast before departing Shaw’s Hiker Hostel. Poet drove us to the trailhead, we said our goodbyes, and off we trekked. We are southbound hikers trekking from Maine to New York, finishing our adventurous journey.  The Appalachian Trail bestowed upon us fairly easy terrain with large rocks, roots, mini rollercoaster hills to trek all day (Yay!), rocky streams to cross, squirrels gathering acorns, and a garden snake.

Along the way, we stopped to chat and giggle with hikers Fire Goddess, Maxine, Genesis, Argentine, and Frog.

Deciding to call it a day, we spied a flat stealth site near a quiet stream. We snuggled in our warm cozy sleeping quilts, giggling as raindrops gently tapped on the rain fly before falling into a sweet slumber on the Appalachian Trail!!!","Shaw’s Hiker Hostel, Maine

Our alarm clock was the trickling stream nearby on this cold morning. We recalled Hippie Chick’s wise words, “If you pack light, then you’re cold at night!” Our puffy clothes will be keeping us toasty warm.

The Appalachian Trail kindly bequeathed us easy terrain with stepping stones, boardwalks, roots, moose brownie bites (poop), survey markers, long flowing moss, streams to ford, mushrooms, colorful flowers, squirrels munching on acorns, and AT markings carved on downed trees and painted on rocks.

We were awakened to loons calling in the distance, so we filled our hip pouches with yummy snacks and off we trekked on this cool morning. The Appalachian Trail graced us a pleasant surprise of cairns to mark the foggy, light rainy day on the trail. The terrain was the easiest since we entered Maine, with a delightful trek of mini boulders to climb and very few rocks and roots. We encountered a piped spring to replenish our water supply, a river to ford by rock hopping, and the best privy in Maine at Moxie Bald Mountain Pond Lean-To (complete with toilet paper, sanitizer, clothes rack, thermometer, and tea lights. . .yes tea lights). There were huckleberries and blueberries to dine on, squirrels and chipmunks gathering nuts, a teeter-totter rock to play on, Moxie Pond to ford by rock hopping, and Trail Angels (out of sandwiches, out of snacks) serving beer. We saved the beer for other hikers, but the thought was sweet.

Hikers Slow & Slower (his twin), Tangles, Bobo, and Yoyo stopped to chat and giggle as we swapped upcoming terrain information.

We arrived at a nice little stealth site and set up camp in record time between rain showers. The funniest things happen when you least expect them, making you giggle.

A brave little chipmunk challenged Swamp Irish for sitting on his log! Needless to say, the chipmunk won and supper was cooked on a neighboring log.

Brave little chattering chipmunks and sounds of an excavator working in the distance were the Appalachian Trail’s alarm clocks on this chilly morning.

We trekked the mountain (Pleasant Pond Mountain) that would never end as the trail gifted us with flows of ups and downs, over roots, rocks, & boardwalks; around ponds; and through overgrown paths. Then there were pond skimmers to contend with when resupplying our water — squirrels throwing acorns at us and then laughing, and slippery pine cones. REALLY!!!!

Everything is Beautiful here on the Appalachian Trail! Now let me set the record straight. . .that is a day hiker’s description when a thru-hiker is in need of upcoming terrain information.

Before coming on the Appalachian Trail, we did not use profanity (bad words, obscenities, cusswords, blasphemy, sewer mouth, bad language, etc.) at all. Our kids were not allowed to use profanity. Our grandkids were not allowed to use profanity. Their friends were not allowed to use profanity. Let’s put this in layman’s terms. . .no bad words at our humble abode! We have since discovered there is a place for everything and everything has its place. The Appalachian Trail is that place! I will be kind here, so even the young may read this. When talking into the phone, it will not even spell words of profanity, but instead types ****.

To our proofers. . .leave the spelling & gramma alone! 
We’re in ahh taka poo poo kaka land!

If you climb this mountain, you’re in for a ROOT awakening. This is like p**** terrain. If you get past the roots you got it licked.

We’re rock climbing like a dingle dangle *^#%×~~. What the f***!?!? Make that a frick a frack terrain. Ahh S***! Dang this is a she tea mountain! We would carry soap to wash out our mouths, but that would add extra weight to our packs! So our language hygiene needs sanitizing before returning home.

Thru-hikers Mosie, Daddy Long Legs, Honey Bun, Green, Big Bird, Kevin, and Cajun paused their trek to chat and giggle while gathering information of upcoming terrain. No one ever mentioned the word ‘Beautiful.’

The Appalachian Trail sent pleasant distractions calming our P>#@?&%$* with AT carvings on trees and our first switchback since trekking in Maine. The decent down to Holly Brook where hiker Yoyo had setup for the night was a pleasant terrain. We set up camp; resupplied water from the babbling brook, enjoyed fine cuisine consisting of a yummy Mountain House Beef Stew Dinner, and giggled because the Appalachian Trail provides us with all that we need. . .a pleasant place to rest our weary heads, regrouping for tomorrow’s trek!!","Stealth Site near Powerline, Maine

We awoke to the sounds of the nearby babbling brook. The Appalachian Trail granted us pleasant terrain, frogs jumping off the path, squirrels scampering, AT carvings on head banger downed trees, and a babbling brook.

We stumbled onto Sterling Inn Hostel just in the nick of time because we were in need of shelter from Hurricane Ida. We enjoyed a sandwich and ice cream for lunch at the inn. It’s odd that there is little information about Sterling Inn Hostel, so let us fill you in on a few fun facts. It was built in 1816 and renovated in 2017. They offer reasonably priced supplies which we took advantage of. Any hiker may get free shuttles from the trailhead to the hostel and back. They also give free shuttles to and from the Kennebec River Tavern where we enjoyed supper. We are stinky hikers, so the Sterling Inn Hostel offered free showers, free charging stations, free laundry, free common area while we washed clothes, and free food in the common area fridge. This puts them at the top of our list in the free department, giving them a rating of Four Stars and a Smiley Face; **** :-). We giggled with hikers Space Blanket, Tonto, Bird Shit, Bonez, Wanderer, Yoyo, Cajun, OnnaMove (abstract artist), and Neon while watching ‘A Walk in the Woods’ in the commons, taking advantage of the freebies.

Light rain tapping on the window was our alarm clock this morning.

The hurricane went through Louisiana on Monday and remnants of Ida made its way to Caratuck, Maine on Thursday morning. It was just a little rain, so we were able to trek today. Sterling Inn shuttled us to the trailhead after feeding us a delicious breakfast. The Appalachian Trail bestowed one of those magical moments of an easy trek that followed the Kennebec River until we crossed the river in a canoe. Yeah Buddy, we can trek this trail all day! Captain Greg and Swamp Irish paddled the canoe while Sugar Gal took pictures. That was the highlight of our day! Captain Greg asked if she always giggles and Swamp Irish just giggled, shaking his head. 
We were told the day’s trail was flat and easy with a few roots and rocks. However, the terrain became horrific. Two hikers slipped and another fell, injuring himself. This was not an easy trail at all after the rainfall.

The trek was filled with rollercoaster hills with straight ups, straight downs, rocks, and large roots. The Appalachian Trail adorned the trail with cascading streams, a couple of flowers here and there, colorful mushrooms, white crawfish claws, an AT survey marker, and leaping frogs.

Where is a canoe when you need it? You guessed it. . .we had to ford the stream one-tenth of a mile before arriving at our destination. Oh well, we might as well replenish our water supply while we are here.

The miserable trail did not break the spirits of giggling hikers Truck Stop, Mulligan, Tech, Swift, Professor, Savage, Man Scout, Space Blanket, Tonto, Bird Shit, OnnaMove, and Neon who took the blue blaze trail to Harrison’s then the shelter, avoiding fording the stream.

Upon arriving at the shelter, we noticed 20-mile hikers had only trekked 4 miles. . .like us. . .due to the Appalachian Trail’s tiring terrain.

The Appalachian Trail’s morning alarm clock was chattering teeth (ours).

Let’s eat at Harrison’s! Oh that will add an extra mile to our trek. Never mind – we need to keep hiking. We will live to regret this decision!

The Appalachian Trail gave us a cool day as we trekked an uneven terrain and encountered creaky trees, lots of roots, lots of rocks, a muddy-slippery rock bed, moose droppings, yellow fluttering butterflies, ruffled mushrooms, squirrels scampering across the logs with pine cones clutched in their teeth, woodpeckers tapping Morse Code on a nearby tree, AT survey markers, AT carvings on downed trees, ponds, ducks, white blazes to guide the way, and boardwalks that meandered through the bogs.

Swamp Irish is singing ‘All the Doo Dah Day,’ AT style down the trail, betting his money that there would be no rocks. Sugar Gal giggled.

He also took time to do trail maintenance by moving trees that had fallen across the path.

Hikers Easy E, Life Alert, Gas Bag, Eeyore, Space Blanket, Tonto, and B S camped at the shelter, giving us the scoop of their delicious breakfast at Harrison’s.

Wake up Swamp Irish! The loons’ concert and squirrels chattering as they gather nuts are calling us to breakfast! All we have heard for the past few days are there is trail magic at the base of the Bigelows.

The Appalachian Trail decided to send a pleasant distraction from the wet, slippery mud, roots, and rocks from last night’s rain. It has given us such a cold morning that we could see our breath as we trekked through the howling winds that created huge waves, splashing on the rocks of the pond’s shore. We left the winds and the pond to discover breathtaking sunrays beaming onto AT markings on down trees as the trail followed a cascading stream. Ahh yes, the Appalachian Trail changed, allowing us to trek faster on better terrain.

Hikers Urkel, Featherweight, Lady Bags, Ice Pack, Tennessee Walker, Craig, Table Saw, Which Way, Sarah U, Bone Spur, Somewhere, Water Boy, Foot Gear, Will, Song Bird, Space Blanket, Tonto, and Bird Shit paused to inform us of upcoming terrain, the dreaded hornets’ nest hanging over the trail, and trail magic ahead. We all giggled and trekked on.

We came to a stretch of easy trekking complete with footbridges, when we spied a message just for us. 1,600 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced around the mushroom, taking pictures!

100 Mile Wilderness Fairies must have passed the word to the Bigelows Fairies near the base of the mountain range that we would be celebrating 1,600 miles of hiking the Appalachian Trail! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with easy terrain dodging the hornets’ nest and fed us a delicious late breakfast (egg, cheese, and sausage biscuits, coffee, chocolate, cold drinks), and then sent us happily away with extra weight of cakes, cookies, candies, and prized honey buns, all courtesy of the giggling Maine Appalachian Trail Club Trail Angels.

‘Baby, it’s Cold Outside.’

The Appalachian Trail planned for us a spectacular day of trekking the ridge of the mountains with magnificent views.

Cell Service! Stop Trekking! I have a Bar!! In the past few days, hikers informed us that Louisiana was hit hard by Hurricane Ida and we haven’t heard from the kids. The sound of their voices made us giggle, calming our greatest fears that floated away as they told of their adventures weathering the storm of mass destruction. Off we happily trekked.

Oh, Wait! We did not ask them if our antebellum home was still standing. . .giggling, we trekked onward, happy just knowing of their safety.

Hikers Spider Woman, Sysco, Pops, Linger, Simba, Reservoir Shire, Winner, JJ, GoneWithTheWind, Go Boy, and Duckling paused on their trek to chat and giggle about upcoming terrain information.

We danced and pranced over small boulders all day as we trekked Little Bigelow and Avery Mountain with smiles on our faces. Dropped packs only once to climb a huge boulder where we were reunited with Rhett & Scarlett whom we met on one of Virginia’s many mountains. About a mile before reaching the campsite, the clouds came over the mountain, engulfing the top with a foggy rain making the trail hard to see and trek.

Once at the campsite, we quickly set up camp in the icy, howling wind. We found an old door near the caretaker’s hut, leaned it against the trees next to the tent, which blocked the strong winds, then cooked a hot meal in the townhouse tent. We giggled, playing the game Let's Make a Deal, guessing What’s Behind Door #1 ?

Wake Up!! Do you hear that? The Appalachian Trail gifted us with the sound of a nothingness silence. The howling winds have ceased.  Up we got and off did trot on this refreshing sunshiny morning, giggling along the way.

“Twist and Shout” was our song of the day, and knee braces were needed to avoid twists on the steep rocky steps trekking over the mountains.

The terrain was treacherous and other words that we can’t type.

The Appalachian Trail distracted us with lovely views of The Horns peaks, yummy blueberries, bees flying from flower to flower gatherings nectar, arm scratchers (low lying branches), a boxed spring to replenish our water supply, and a gentle breeze instead of howling winds.

Hikers Tex, Bus Driver, Grizzly, Bandit, and silly day hikers with unleashed dogs, paused to chat and giggle. Have we mentioned we don’t like unleashed dogs on the trail that pose a danger to hikers? We also met Trail Runner Becca, who shared a wealth of information on upcoming terrain, Shaw’s Hiker Hostel outbreak of COVID, the nearest pharmacy, and the Hostel of Maine (known by all the hikers as HOME).

The Appalachian Trail knows when to give hikers a well-needed break by gracefully offering fewer rocks, roots, and mud, woodpeckers tapping Morse Code, squirrels tossing pine cones while chatting at us, and a flock of black birds flying overhead (look out for incoming. . .droppings that is).

Hold the presses! We came to a screeching halt when we rounded the bend, crossing the road to the parking lot! There in all their glory stood Papa Bear and Care Bear (trekked the Appalachian Trail this year 2021), greeting us with Trail Magic! So we feasted on hot dogs, honey buns, mini cakes, candy bars, pies, etc. And if that wasn’t enough, we were encouraged to shop for food and personal items at their free magical store. Our bill came up to a grand total of a smile, wishing us a safe trek.

Giggling hikers Bloodbath, Frosty, Otter, Butter, Avatar, Corner, Easy, Wind, Poboy, Cactus, Christian, Chicken Leg, and other happy hikers also enjoyed the Trail Magic.

We were awakened by the symphony orchestra of snorers in the bunkhouse below. Mr. Ben shuttled us back to the lovely arms of the Appalachian Trail. Thanks, Mr. Ben!

The first 1.5 miles were steep with a little rock climbing, root climbing, and mud slushing. The Appalachian Trail’s terrain leveled off for 5 miles of gentle flows with smaller rocks, roots, and volunteer trail maintenance being done for drainage. We enjoyed colorful odd mushrooms, head-banger trees, massive roots, tiny pine cones, unique foliage, a piped water source, 2000 marker for hikers, stone path through young spruce trees, and a fire ring waiting to be lit. Not a bad day of tracking until the end where we encountered a rock slide terrain. Very scary, difficult, and steep, including several mini boulders to climb, taking 2 hours for 0.4 miles of horrid rocks. Okay, I’m Done!

Hikers Snazzy, Funds, Buttons, Bourbon, and Batman also thought the last part of the terrain was challenging.

Trekking into the campsite, we discovered an amazing tent pad to set up camp for the night. Wooden tent pads are rare. We giggled as we snuggled into our warm cozy sleeping quilts after begging a chipmunk for the site – he finally gave in and let us have it.

Woke up to Horrible Hiker Hobble. . .say that 3 times. Definition Please! Hiker Hobble (noun): A phenomenon where once the hiker removes his or her backpack, he/she starts to limp and wobble. Usually develops after the first hundred miles, and doesn’t let up.

…For True!!!! What does a hiker do? Giggle while putting the backpack back on and continuing their trek!

Poke me, I’m done! Cookies are done. Roast is done. People are not done, they’re finished. It is cold, so we are finish trekking the wonderment of Maine. According to the hikers we encountered, the weather is getting dangerously cold on the treacherous mountain tops. Before leaving the trail, the AT graced us with a send off of cold air, easy trekking over mini boulders, and rock hopping through trickling streams. No, we are not going home, but instead to a warmer, safer state to continue our adventurous journey south on the Appalachian Trail.

While trekking the Appalachian Trail, we heard mixed reviews of the Roadhouse: a wild, rowdy hostel for non-serious hikers; a hostel that takes excellent care of its hikers. Then we met, chatted, and giggled with Jen at the roadside parking pickup area of ME27 where the trail crosses the road. You know how intuition tells you go to the Maine Roadhouse Hostel, but you hesitate ignoring those senses. Big Mistake! Big Mistake! Well, we have decided we were wrong and hence fixing the mistake. Exceptional hosts Jen & Jen of the Maine Roadhouse Hostel shuttled us from the trail into town to shower at a hotel (room provided by the Roadhouse) due to the water shortage in the area. Their caring generosity is amazing, pampering tired hikers. We enjoyed a yummy meal at Backstrap Bar & Grill before returning to the hostel for the evening.

Chatty, giggling hikers Puffs, Ghost, Fox, Bar Tab, Oreo, Boo Boo, Hazmat (from the 100 Mile Wilderness), Maui, Snazzy (from yesterday), and Clouse (assists hikers at the hostel & is very entertaining) also enjoyed Jen & Jen’s sweet hospitality at the Roadhouse!!","Crocker Cirque Campsite, Maine

Appalachian Trail Zero Travel Day!

Let’s “Follow the Yellow Brick Road” from Maine to New Hampshire.

We trekked down the road to a nearby farm while munching on roadside apples. Yeah Buddy! The Appalachian Trail knows how to feed us, even off the trail.

Hiker Damon (Trail Angel) was heading home and offered to shuttle us to Gorham, New Hampshire on his way home. He paused at the post office to pickup our Yellow Nemo Ultralight Mattress and again for construction workers painting the yellow lines on the road. Thanks Damon for pointing out the beautiful mountain peaks along the way that we had trekked!

Once arriving in Gorham, we enjoyed a yummy lunch at the Pub House.

The Appalachian Trail sends Trail Angels to accompany its hikers back to the trail to discover new adventures. We giggled, knowing Bruce would be our shuttle chariot to Hanover, New Hampshire, carrying us safely back to the loving arms of the Appalachian Trail!!","Maine Roadhouse Hostel, Maine

The Appalachian Trail knows when its hikers need to be pampered.

Bruce’s Shuttle Service brought us from the Gorham, New Hampshire Quality Inn to the New Hampshire/Vermont line as we enjoyed the mountain views, turkeys, deer, homes with attached barns (It is common in Maine for barns to be attached to the house so you may tend to livestock in the fridget winter), and charming small towns. Thanks Mr. Bruce for your kindness!

The trail meandered through the delightful college town of Hanover, New Hampshire, across the Connecticut River, and the lovely tiny town of Norwich, Vermont before leading us back onto the easy trail leading into the woods.

Upon arriving at the shelter, we met and giggled with an elderly, blind gentleman who had hiked the trail many years ago and helped maintain the trail for 30 years. It was a pleasure to chat with him and his daughter. After taking pictures to show proof to their family and friends, they were off to trek back home.

Swamp Irish searched for a tree to hang our bear bag, called for Sugar Gal’s assistance, and pointed to the orange ribbon. We giggled, for the Appalachian Trail had strategically placed a survey marker next to our tent townhouse one-tenth of a mile from the trail for us to discover on this Happy Hill!!","Hanover, New Hampshire

We were awakened by squirrels throwing acorns on top of our tent and birds singing. The Appalachian Trail had lain before us an amazing day! The easy terrain was lined with lovely stone fences along the path, an eerie morning fog, slippery acorns sprinkled across the trail, and cannabis extract cartridges trail magic (we opted to leave them for other hikers). However, we enjoyed plump juicy blackberries while collecting berries for tomorrow’s breakfast. We also gazed at the wonderment of pretty purple flowers, white blazes in unusual places along the trail, unique colorful mushrooms, fuzzy white and fuzzy yellow caterpillars, and frogs jumping out from underneath the pine needles to escape our path.

The trail meandered through the quaint little town of West Hartford, Vermont, taking us to Captain Stash’s where we resupplied our water. Then, onto White River Junction, crossing the bridge that many a crazy hiker has jumped off, broken bones, and ended up going to the hospital…because hikers are dingy. We opted to pass on that, too!

We paused to enjoy a honey bun before continuing through grassy fields, mini trickling waterfalls, and fall leaf and mica rock chips covering the trail. The Appalachian Trail loves to pamper hikers, so we enjoyed an apple from the apple orchard while resting on a “Welcome to Vermont” bench. Ahh yes, an apple a day keeps the doctor away! For the first time, we saw maple tree tapping lines entwined in the trees going down the mountain.

A drizzling, misty rain kept us refreshed during the last mile of our trek toward the shelter. Shhhh! Don’t tell anyone! It’s a secret! Evening was upon us, we have not seen a hiker all day, so we giggled while setting up our townhouse tent in the shelter.

It was a cool day as we endured not-so-easy rock climbing, trekked through grassy fields, and danced over rocky streams. The Appalachian Trail entertained us with squirrels, woodpeckers, and birds foraging for food; a bull calling in the distance; AT survey markers; bright red wild cherries sprinkled on the path; fields of flowers; unique yellow laced mushrooms; bright orange newts; butterflies fluttering down the path; crickets and frogs jumping across the trail; fine china to dine on; and sawmill sounds echoing down the mountain side.

We paused on our trek to chat and giggle with lifelong hiker Ain’t Right and then hear the tall tale stories of Crunchy, Star Gazer, Huffin’, and Puffin’.

We lay in our cozy sleeping quilts, listening to a distant coyote concert and giggling because we had gotten side tracked (trekking off the trail), walked to the ‘On the Edge Farm’ to eat a pint of Hershey’s green mint chip ice cream, and bought pastries for supper, before returning to the patiently waiting Appalachian Trail!!","Thistle Hill Shelter, Vermont

Our Appalachian Trail alarm clock this morning was a nearby rooster crowing “Rise and Shine.” We giggled and sang, “Old McDonald had a farm.”

Sugar Gal whispered, “I’m hungry!” Swamp Irish replied, “I’ll go get the bear bags so I can make a yummy breakfast!” Sugar Gal became very worried when Swamp Irish did not return quickly from retrieving the bear bags he had hung the night before. We forgot to place a cat eye (reflective marker) on the tree. Lesson Learned!

It was not a bad day of trekking in the cool air with easy ups, downs, and flat terrain. The Appalachian Trail frequently placed streams of ice cold water along the trail and entertained us with scampering squirrels and chipmunks, singing birds, tiny bright orange newts, a sneaky snake, colorful mushrooms, and rumbles of the Nothing, from The Never Ending Story. (We heard rumbles resembling the sounds of the Nothing.)

At The Lookout fire tower we ate lunch, chatted, and giggled with hikers Luscious and Two Pack.

If you would like fine dining on the trail, then you had better remember where you hang your bear bag the night before.

The Appalachian Trail unfolds new adventures every day and today would be very adventurous! The cool morning greeted us with a gentle alarm clock of a nearby soothing stream, then an easy terrain of rolling hills. The sun came up over the mountain in the distance when we spotted a bear cave. We trekked on confetti leaves with holes and little dots of confetti from the leaves, through vibrant orange-leafed trees, unique colorful mushrooms, an encouraging message on a fallen tree, sounds of a grouse beating his chest, and farm animals calling in the distance had us singing Farmer in the Dell.

There has been lots of logging in the area which presented trail obstacles; toe tippers, head bangers, hair combers, ear cleaners (without the Q-tip), toothbrushes, waist whackers, and knee knockers. We giggled, singing Lou, Lou, Skip to my Lou, my Darlin’, as we skipped to the side and dodged tree obstacles on the trail.

We paused in our trek to chat and giggle with hikers CC, Barefoot Sumo, Extra, Finder, Funcle, Egg, Snoozer, Handful of Days, No Rush, and crazy hiker with his wild dog.

Every once in a while the Appalachian Trail is full of surprises, giving hikers puzzle solvers. The trail led us to a cliff wall, so we scratched our heads, looked to the left, then looked to the right to spy a ladder…You’ve got to be kidding! You want me to carry this 28 lb. backpack straight up a 12 foot ladder?!?! Breathe in, breathe out, and take it one rung at a time. We giggled at the ladder once on top of the cliff and informed the next hiker not to worry, there’s a ladder to help you get down the mountain.

Rock and Roll; our tent was set up on uneven rocky terrain. If both doors would have been open, we would have rolled out the tent as we climbed in! We began to giggle.

Our alarm clock was a flock of black birds singing in the trees. We woke up ready and raring to trek into town to enjoy hot showers and real food! However, first we would have to trek quickly under the flock, dodging their droppings from above and on the ground.

The Appalachian Trail gave us easy terrain on boardwalks, through bogs, and along the calm glassy ponds while 2 grumpy old men fished from their boat. We encountered cliff hangers with rushing streams below, rock steps to assist hikers when climbing the mountain, overgrown trails, uniquely shaped mushrooms, Gifford Woods State Park, orange flowers, and green moss-covered rocks.

Hikers J Pop, Robin, 2 Banks, Caboose, Sideboard, and Peaches stopped to chat and giggle of the upcoming terrain.

Since COVID, buses are free to ride into the town of Rutland, Vermont, so we caught a bus instead of calling for a shuttle. Upon dropping us off, the bus driver warned that we were not in a good part of town, encouraging us to stay at the hostel. We heeded his advice, hiked to 5 Guys to eat then on to the Yellow Deli Hostel.

We lounged in the commons area, chatting and giggling with many hikers including Giggles, Free Rider, and Alyssa (hiking the LT).

When we arrived at the hostel, we were informed that we could not bunk in the same room or on the same floor. It was not the first time we were asked to stay in separate rooms. At the Ironmaster Mansion, the signs separated the men from the women; however, we were the only hikers there…rules are meant to be broken.

Good Morning Honey! Good Morning Darling! The Appalachian Trail had given us an extra day to refresh while waiting for our package. We said our goodbyes to Ashe and Slow Poke Rodriguez from the Hikers Hostel, thanking them for their hospitality, breakfast, and supper. Yellow Deli Trivia as we know it: This church-generated group operates on donations, pampers a hiker’s every whim, makes household products (teas, soaps, cleaners, etc.), and assists anyone who comes to their doorstep, not just hikers. Now, rumor hath it, they were a cult, but we felt the Appalachian Trail sent us there for a reason…a safe, peaceful place to revitalize before returning to her loving arms.

The call of the Appalachian Trail had us up at the crack of dawn to catch the first bus (bus station behind the hostel) back to the trailhead marked with white blazes and LT-AT. What in the world is an LT? We should have done our homework! Excitement rushed through our bodies as we trekked fairly easy terrain up Killington Mountain, over sculptured roots, a grouse in flight, slithering snakes, staircase steps, muddy mud, small roots, small rocks, and suddenly 25 mph winds & cold.

Light tap, tap, tapping on the townhouse tent were our alarm clock on this frigid morning…sounds like pine needles falling on the tent roof. It wasn’t long before we discovered the Appalachian Trail had not awakened us with pine needles but an eerie, foggy, rainy cloud causing droplets from the trees and wind which engulfed the top of the mountain. Let’s enjoy a fancy Mountain House Breakfast Skillet meal consisting of potatoes, scrambled eggs, sausage, and peppers…Yum!

Off we trekked a terrain that remained in the clouds for about a mile as we climbed down the mountain, then suddenly the clouds dissipated. The terrain was a moderate trek of roots and rocks for steps. The Appalachian Trail’s distractions were brain boppers, knee knockers, toe trippers, unique mushrooms sprinkled along the trail, colorful fall leaves, roosters crowing in the distance, yummy apples, AT survey markers, moose tracks in the mud (no moose sighting), fence ladders to climb, stone walls along the path, and fluttering butterflies in fields of dainty flowers.

We love it when hikers tell us they have a good dog…a stupid dog ran toward Sugar Gal (she is a dog magnet) causing her to fall. She screamed, and the owner apologized, trying to get the dog under control to no avail and having to hit it to make it run away. Sugar Gal is shaken but fine thanks to Monet Maven; her backpack cushion. Needless to say, we did not stop to chat and giggle with the hiker. The hiker’s dad shook his head saying he told his son to leave the dog at home.

The trail was steep on the last half mile, which became a rock slide. Dang!

Rain is due about midnight and there are no tent sites, so we made an executive decision to stay in the shelter for the night. Cocoa (a Marine stationed in Hawaii) and Humble Bee trekked into camp and prepared their supper when Humble Bee discovered she had left her spork at the last shelter.

Rain filled the Appalachian Trail with streams of water, mud, slippery rocks and roots, and autumn leaves that decorated the trail and covered the misery underneath. With rain came howling winds, blowing limbs, leaves, and trees down on the trail. Hiker Cocoa whizzed past us giggling as we trekked the misery.

What was supposed to be a trickling stream beneath the bridge is now a rushing roaring river after last night’s rain, and the beaver dam has water flowing over it as if there is no dam. Our last hundred miles in Vermont has turned into the swamplands of Louisiana. We grumbled, why would they have a trail through swampland and call it the Appalachian Trail? Swamp Irish fell twice on muddy, slippery roots & rocks; saved by his backpack both times.

Our reprieve from the misery was a cool day with comical chipmunks, tweeting birds, wiggly worms, and towering cairns.

The Appalachian Trail’s alarm clock awakened us to Canadian geese debating on which way to fly. Today was to be a long trek, so we have time to solve the world’s problems…or shall we say…Vermont’s mud issue.

The terrain was muddy mud that is MUD, so we sang the mud song, MUD by Road Hammers, as we trekked! Sugar Gal has come to the conclusion that being a sugar artist, she can solve Vermont’s mud issue. Vermont is muddy and it stinks! They take great pride in this mud so they place signs along the trail that tell hikers to remain on the trail and to walk through the mud. (You can’t make these things up!) But, the mud stinks and it goes almost up to your knees, hence muddy hiking shoes.

Okay let’s think for just one moment. A hiker’s most prized possession is his/her hiking shoes, which are the most comfortable pair of shoes and cost more than any other shoes a hiker has ever owned. Our hiking shoes allow us to trek the most rugged terrain encountered. That is what keeps a hiker happy…Happy Feet! So, would the GMC (Green Mountain Club – caretakers of the trail) send their children out to play in this mud, put them to bed with muddy feet and muddy shoes, and then the next day bring them to church, muddy and stinky like this Vermont trail?

Sugar Gal wants to reconstruct Vermont terrain like she constructs her sugar art masterpieces…problem solved…we’re in trouble.

We just love it when the Appalachian Trail offers distractions of lovely autumn colors reflecting on the calm Stratton Pond, dainty flowers, tiny miniature mushrooms, huge mushroom clusters growing on trees, discovered survey markers, and dilapidated boardwalks through swampy bogs. So we giggled, singing “Jump, shout, let it all out! These are the things I can do without! Come on, I’m talking to you!”…back to the journal, honking geese flying in a check formation instead of a V formation, a grouse thumping and flying, little orange newts wiggling across the trail, creepy spiders, and giant ants. Ahh, after 11 miles of mud, the trail is not so muddy, making an easier trek before arriving at the shelter.

The large shelter was filled with giggling hikers including Zeke, Night Crawler, and Joseph enjoying the bear boxes while telling of their amazing journey trekking to the magnificent summit of Stratton Mountain. At the flat tent site we cleaned our shoes, we cleaned our feet, we snuggled, and we giggled drifting off to a sweet slumber. Who knew that the Appalachian Trail would send us muddy adventures!!

The frigid Appalachian air was our alarm clock. Off we went to trek the muddy Vermont trail on this cold morning — in the thirties. Blowing and rolling smoke with our breath made us giggle. It is odd that we have been hearing about the Trail Angel ice cream man at the VT9 trailhead…but, it’s never too cold for ice cream. We hiked easy terrain along the foggy beaver pond where we spotted beavers taking a morning swim, their lodges, and dams before heading through the bogs.

I have the munchies. Let’s enjoy our 8 o’clock honey bun, at 7. What started as a sweet danish ritual turned into a honey bun moment. The day’s trek gave us time to reminisce about the National Supermarket’s 10 cent sale many years ago with honey buns, bread, cokes, etc. At the day-old bread store, they had 10 cent honey buns also. Just a little honey bun trivia for you.

It is amazing that the roots and the rocks are not slippery in the muddy sections of the trail here in Vermont. Our first 3 miles were a rocky muddy nightmare. The trail became drier with much less mud gracing us with 40 minute miles. We felt like Flash speeding down the trail. Things are looking up! The Appalachian Trail also entertained us with moose tracks through the mud (no moose sightings), newts, frogs, trickling streams along the trail, geese, planes, woodpeckers, chipmunks scampering, lovely mountain views of autumn colors, bogs, and downed trees causing head bangers and knee knockers.

At the base of Glastenbury Mountain, we discovered a quaint little stealth site to camp for the night. Settling into our warm cozy quilts, we giggled for the highlight of our day was the high tower we climbed on the summit while trekking the Appalachian Trail!!","Stony Spring Shelter, Vermont

The Appalachian Trail sent tweeting yellow finch alarm clocks this morning.

We giggled, trekking a terrain that meandered over ridges of white blazed rocks and skinny boulders that resembled a sandwich cookie, making us the center. Our entertaining trail also provided us with a piped stream to replenish our water, Canadian geese flying, frogs jumping, head bangers, knee knockers, toe tripper, ups, mud, downs, mud, rocks, mud, roots, mud, and a half mile Grand Finale of a steep, straight down, rocky steps/slide.

We live a very sheltered life, so hiker Late Bloomer enlightened us, broadening our vocabulary calling muddy Vermont…Vermud! We all giggled, trekking onward.

Hiker Garfield told us there’s Trail Magic at the highway. Sure enough, hiker Onasamus, the ice cream man with trail magic, also treated Shredder and Dinosaur. We sat, giggled, and enjoyed his magic until our motel shuttle driver scooped us up to bring us safely to the Catamount Motel. We ordered delivery supper, showered, let the Catamount Motel wash our stinky hiker clothes, ate, ate, and ate some more.

Caught a free bus into town. We are enjoying the free Vermont transportation due to COVID. Every hiker’s dream!

Shopped at Walmart to resupply our food (1 chicken packet) and also pick up winter base layers to warm us while we work/hike. Then we headed over to Price Chopped to resupply the other food items, including frozen meals for supper, milk, and snacks.

Next, we went to Super Cuts for Sugar Gal to strut a new hair style and then caught a bus back to the motel area.

We ate, packed, and relaxed.

The call of the Appalachian Trail was our alarm clock on this cold morning. As we closed the door to the Catamount Motel, a hiker asked if we had slept well after all of the commotion last night. The FBI and local law enforcement, looking for Brian Laundrie (from Florida) who was supposedly trekking the Appalachian Trail, detained the hiker (also from Florida) in the room next to ours. We thank the FBI and local law enforcement for keeping us safe on the Appalachian Trail.

It’s Cold! However, our new base layer is keeping us toasty warm.

The trail was a very steep, straight up, rocky scramble climb that was blanketed with autumn leaves the first half mile. Fun!

Man down! Man down! A jagged rock snatched Sugar Gal’s water bottle, pulling it from her pack. The bottle rolled off the rock boulder into a tiny crevasse below. Oh no, this mountain will not beat me! Swamp Irish yelled, ‘Leave it!’ because of the dangers. She dropped her pack, climbed over the boulder and clutched a nearby rock as she reached for the fallen bottle. ‘I got it!’ We giggled. For those of you who do not know, your water bottle is a precious piece of gear! Swamp Irish helped her put her backpack on to continue their trek.

The path leveled out to easy trekking flows of ups, downs, a lovely view of the town of Bennington below, streams flowing through the trail, little mud, boardwalks, fewer rocks and roots, and ATVs zooming across the trail.

We arrived at the shelter about 1:30 to enjoy lunch and set up camp for the night. Two hikers trekked into camp thirty minutes later. They were only too happy to inform us of all the things we were doing wrong about trekking the Appalachian Trail. Really?! After 7 months and almost 2,000 miles we’re still alive and doing well, hiking the Appalachian Trail?! Where were you when we started?!

Hmmm, we looked at each other in pure amazement and started giggling. So we did what any hiker would do...left the shelter to set up our townhouse tent as their voices grew louder and louder, informing incoming hikers what they were doing wrong on the trail. They were the only hikers who stayed in the shelter. The other 9 hikers also set up their tents.

Lying in our cozy sleeping quilts and warm base layers, we giggled thinking even the Appalachian Trail has a sense of humor. We listened to the tranquil stream, ATVs racing in the distance, and the chatter in the campground before drifting off into a sweet slumber on the Appalachian Trail!!!","VT9 Catamount Motel — Bennington, Vermont

Would you please turn the alarm clock off? I can’t; that is a woodpecker tapping on a nearby tree foraging for breakfast. It will start raining early this evening, so away we trekked to the next shelter to bunker down before the rains begin.

The day was cold with an occasional drizzling rain and mud dodging trail. The Appalachian Trail’s distractions were a grouse flying, chipmunks scampering and gathering acorns, colorful autumn leaves sprinkled on the trail, lots of green foliage and mushrooms, torrent (I like that word, found in my thesaurus because flowing just would not work for me…LOL) streams along the trail, giant watery mud puddles, cupped spider webs, moose tracks (no moose sightings), and root staircases. The stunning autumn colors are becoming more vivid, brightening our day as we trek on boardwalks through muddy bogs and along beaver ponds.

We stopped to chat and giggle with section hiker David, whose son is hiking the Appalachian Trail. He also let us know that Special Ed would be at the shelter we were heading toward, eating a hot meal.

Upon arriving at the Seth Warner Shelter, we met the hiker detained at the Catamount Motel by the FBI. Before setting up his tent he enlightened us with the story that someone from Walmart contacted the FBI because he was from Florida, hiking the Appalachian Trail. We assured him that we were happy he was back on the trail.

Hikers Special Ed, Crystal Child, Scrapbook, Ginger Ballz, and Mighty Michael, wandered into camp and giggled because we had all made it before the rains began.

Special Ed Story: A Special Education teacher, trekked with David for a few days, was delighted David gave up his prized (Yeah, Right) Good To-Go Thai meal, proudly made in Maine, so he would not go hungry before getting off the trail in Bennington, Vermont. Unbeknownst to Special Ed, the meal is Spicy Hot beyond belief! We told him that was sweet of David and how delicious the meal tasted (we had tried one in the past; operative word, tried). Been there, done that, that meal is the hottest a hiker can eat. Everyone giggled as he gasped for breath, tears rolled down his cheeks before swallowing the first bite.

Special Ed did not finish his meal, and all drifted to sleep in the shelter to musical raindrops and serenading hikers snoring in sync…only on the Appalachian Trail!!","Congdon Shelter, Vermont

The Appalachian Trail’s alarm woke us up to a cool, windy morning. We heard a tree fall during the night from the strong winds.

It is amazing that with the rain gushers all night, there was very little mud on the trail from the shelter to the Vermont/Massachusetts line. We danced down the trail upon crossing the border. As we trekked the trail, we giggled, commenting that we must be leaving Vermud.

The entertaining Appalachian Trail gave us giant stepping stones to trek, avoiding the mud. When a rock is missing on the muddy trail it becomes, “One giant step for mankind!” Hikers think of silly nonsense sayings…I got to here, but I hadn’t got to there, yet I’m rock-hopping. (See, Silly Saying.) Today’s terrain is much better, even in the gentle rain showers, as we enjoyed colorful flowers, ruffled mushrooms, and tree and rock sculptures.

We walked into town, picked up lunch, checked into the motel, ate, showered, resupplied, and snuggled into a comfy bed, giggling that we were able to chat with Dora from the Appalachian Trail before drifting into sweet slumber to the pitter patter of raindrops!!!","Seth Warner Shelter, Vermont

Let’s hike Mount Greylock! Greylock Trivia: Greylock is the highest peak in Massachusetts on the Appalachian Trail. The Appalachian Trail unfolds new adventures every day, and today would be very adventurous! We trekked Mount Greylock in the drizzling rain. Rains continued off and on all day. The terrain started out with a minimal amount of mud…Awesome! So we danced, giggled, and took pictures of treasures we found on the trail: AT markings to show the way, bridge stream crossings, shiny mica rocks, a variety of colorfully shaped mushrooms, a grouse thumping, bright orange wiggly newts, slugs clinging to trees, mask hanging in trees (COVID protection for trees), large stepping rock staircases, water flowing down the path, war memorial, dreary valley views of white noise, unique Thunderbolt Shelter, ski lodge, and AT markers replaced white trail blazes to guide the way.

Hikers Spiderman, Sea Level, and Dora enjoyed the summit of Mount Greylock, giggling before continuing their trek.

We love Massachusetts’ bear boxes at the shelters! Father and son hikers had offered to make room in the shelter, but instead we chose a dry tent pad to set our townhouse tent upon.

It is cold so let’s cook in our townhouse tent (this defies all logic…and all safety warnings). “Perhaps his head wasn’t screwed on just right”...make that the pot on the stove. It went up in flames! Stop screaming and throw it out the tent, unzip the doors quickly, turn it off, blow it out, Stop, Drop, and Roll!!! Okay it’s out.

Would you please turn off the alarm clock, I’m too tired to get up? That’s the chipmunks talking to each other in a high-pitched frequency and like birds chirping; can’t turn ‘em off. Then shoot the little varmints; don’t have a gun…too much weight! We giggled, rising to a cold sunny morning on the Appalachian Trail. The terrain was foggy at times with sunshine peaking through the canopy of trees, an arched tree, lush green foliage, unique colorful mushrooms, vibrant flowers, red berry bushes, cattle guard crossings, rickety boardwalks, powerful power line views (Who put this giant mud puddle across the path?), rushing streams of tiny waterfalls, survey marker sightings, and sounds of trains, planes, and automobiles.

The Appalachian Trail meanders through town, so let’s grab a bite to eat. A little way down the road, we giggled at the hiker crossing sign laying on the ground after a vehicle had rolled over it. We hope they missed the hiker! Needless to say we were very careful trekking the trail through Cheshire, known for its Mammoth Cheese. The Appalachian Trail was decorated with scary Halloween skeletons waving goodbye to us as the trail turned to the woods.

The terrain of colorful autumn leaves moseyed through grassy fields, so we paused for a cereal snack…AT shaped cereal was an amazing surprise, how fitting! To top it off, the Appalachian Trail graced us with benches to rest upon, scampering squirrels and chipmunks, slugs hanging onto trees, and a cute little stealth site on the edge of the cliff, complete with a log bench and fire ring that made us giggle...look out below!

We hiked our merry way until we arrived at the campsite, with a bear box, a privy, a fire ring, and flat sites. I’m tired, so we snuggled in our warm comfy quilts giggling that the Appalachian Trail cut an AT on the privy door with a screen behind the carving and after an exhaustion trek wants us to harvest duff to dump in the privy before we poop!!

Dreaming about having real food and our growling bellies were our alarm clocks on this gorgeous morning. The Appalachian Trail bestowed a nice easy trail with no water, not much mud, and cold crisp air. The trail seemed to come alive with vibrant autumn-colored leaves on the trees and blanketing the path, swirly curly mushrooms, chipmunks playing hide and seek, grouse in flight, tiny frogs leaping from the trail, woodpeckers chatting, crows calling, gentle rock steps, a giant stream roaring with tiny waterfalls below a ravine, and shots from a nearby firing range. Every once in a while, the Appalachian Trail loves to throw hikers a curve ball. Today it was a test of balance; walking on acorns are like stepping on marbles as you slip and slide.

The trail meandered though the quaint little town of Dalton with AT sidewalk markers leading the way and a nutria rat enjoying lunch. Lunch Time! We dined at Dalton Restaurant for the most delicious hamburger ever, only to be distracted for a moment by a TICK!!! Kill it, Stomp it, Smash it!…just don’t eat it!

We resupplied and picked up a yummy sandwich to enjoy for supper at Cumberland Farms on the way out of town. Footloose and fancy-free, we giggled and continued our trek climbing the mountain towards the shelter.

We trekked down a stone staircase when we spied a message just for us. 1,800 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced over the board rail at the bottom of the staircase, taking pictures!

Wood Chip Fairies near White Rock Cliffs must have passed the word to the White Flower Fairies near the spring that we would be celebrating 1,800 miles of hiking! Now the White Flower Fairies giggled as they flew away because one of their Fairies is dingy, did not get the flower memo, and placed a white mushroom on their flower masterpiece as they sweetly left us a spectacular white flower message! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with easy terrain and green foliage dripped water off of the rocks.

Smile, You’re on Candid Camera! And smile is exactly what the trail did as we went rock hopping on rocking rocks, were double-crossed by crossing over two logs at one jump, and danced on sparkles in the dirt and on rocks.

We shucked warm clothes as we trekked, then snacked on a honey bun. Humm, I see a Danish in there…ate a Danish too. Yum!

The Appalachian Trail entertained us with water droplets on leaves; a grouse in flight; chipmunks gathering food; acorns on the path; gun range shooting nearby; and apples for the taking, causing pure enjoyment to the taste buds. The forest came alive with vibrant autumn leaves and mushrooms; creative white blaze markings on rocks to guide its hikers; AT survey markers making us giggle; trickling streams; misshapen boardwalks sprinkled with colorful spruce needles; a beaver lodge and lumber jack/beaver-cut trees; three biting tiny black flies; and trail magic of cheese and olives.

Raindrops (from foggy, rainy clouds causing droplets from the trees tapping on the townhouse tent) were our alarm clock on this frigid morning. The Appalachian Trail had us blowing smoke as we trekked along a tranquil flowing stream.

The terrain flowed up and down as autumn leaves covered the forest floor. These colorful autumn leaves also decorated the cedar trees like giant Christmas tree ornaments; pretty yellow and red leaves had fallen on the limbs for adornment. A tree fell in the woods, which saddened our hearts and the deafening sound was very scary as it fell across the path only moments before us. Poor Little Fellar!

We discovered AT carvings. We trekked fields, over roads, along ponds with beaver cut trees, past an old fireplace near Upper Goose Pond, on boardwalks, and got bored so we did a little rock climbing. We could hear a roaring stream under the rocks and dirt, but couldn’t see any water from this underground stream.

We have not seen many hikers so it was a pleasure to chat and giggle with Just Matt, Guardian, and Black Light about upcoming terrain.

A trio of owls hooting, stream trickling, and the wind blowing the autumn leaves on the trees were our alarm clock on this cold Appalachian Trail morning. We enjoyed yummy Maltey’s Marshmallow Cereal with hot chocolate mix in cold water before continuing our adventurous journey.

The terrain was easy down the mountain and then boardwalks through swampy land. Some boards leaned, some were broken, some were straight, some were squeaky, and some wobbled as you walked the boardwalks.

A soon-to-be Eagle Scout from Troop 77 was trekking, inspecting the boardwalks to get ideas for his Eagle Project: building footbridges in the area. Yea! We giggled and congratulated him on his future rank before trekking onward.

Danger, Will Robinson! The leaves were fun to kick and play in as we trekked, but then the lovely colorful autumn leaves became dangerous, covering mud, rocks, and roots and causing very slippery terrain. The Appalachian Trail gifted us with pleasant distractions of old farm houses in the distance, unique mushrooms, a grouse thumping, blackbirds flying, crows calling, chipmunks and squirrels barking, and oddly placed white blazes. Volunteer Ideas: Paint white blazes on new little young trees. That way you will not have to paint them for many years to come and you will be promoted to Volunteer First Class! Being the brilliant hikers we are, we patted ourselves on the back, giggled, and continued our trek.

We chose to pass the north shelter to get more mileage for the day. Upon arriving at Mt.

The Appalachian Trail bequeathed a well maintained trail with wonderful drainage, diverting the water off the trail (this drainage would have been nice in Vermont). We were amused by crows calling, birds singing, and hooty-hoot owls as we trekked along rushing streams that awakened our senses. Trail maintenance volunteers have become very creative with white blazes painted on rocks for when you’re looking down and painted high on trees for when you’re looking up, way up. Santa is hiking the Appalachian Trail this year, headed to the North Pole, and we let him know we had been a very good little boy and girl this year…he just giggled. Dang…He Knows! We trekked between rock boulders, hopped over huge roots, danced over boardwalks and footbridges, took a break to enjoy our last honey bun, stopped to take pictures of pretty purple mushrooms and AT carvings, enjoyed lunch at Tom Leonard Shelter, paused to admire lovely views, trekked pointed ledges, and strolled through fields and over road bridges. Amazingly, we still had time to make up a funny French saying about weekend warriors, wearing masks, treating stinky hikers like they stink…Oh Yeah, we do!

We love the wealth of information hikers share. We were told to call Joe’s Shuttle before trekking to the trailhead at Great Barrington for a ride into town to Monument Mountain Motel. We did, he was waiting, and gave a tour of the town. We were delighted!

The Appalachian Trail’s entertainment included chipmunks scampering, Canadian geese flying in a V-shape, lovely dainty flowers, grassy meadows, fields of corn, railroad track crossings, an old sawmill in the distance cutting wood, rock fence walls, flowing streams, nutria pathways, colorful autumn leaves covering the path, AT markings on trees, wooden bridge crossings, and boardwalks through the muddy trail. We love boardwalks!

An hour into our hike, Sugar Gal’s foot slipped on the muddy boardwalk and she went swimming in the bayou, getting her backpack soaking wet with muddy mucky messy stinky mud. Help! With heroic strength, Swamp Irish grabbed her pack, lifting her from the muck. Shivering, she wiped some of the muck away and changed soaking wet clothes, on the trail in the frigid air while he cleaned her pack so they could continue their journey. Where are your trekking poles? In there…somewhere. She dug in the watery muck, pulling them free from the clutches of the bog. He rinsed off the handles and off we trekked. A few minutes later, we started giggling as we sang…“I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies, I’ll be there. And I swear like the shadow that’s by your side, I’ll be there. To scoop you up, from the watery muck, I’ll be there.”

The climb up Mt. Bushnell was a scary treacherous rock climbing stairway, straight up. We enjoyed giggling hikers, woodpeckers tapping, roosters crowing, frogs jumping, cattle crossings, moose prints in the mud, and sounds of planes, trains, and automobiles.

Upon arriving at the quaint little shelter, a serene stream flowing through the camping area caught our eye; just what we needed. Sugar Gal bathed, washed her muddy clothes and backpack in the icy stream while Swamp Irish prepared a hot meal, hung a clothes line for the wet items, and set up camp.

We woke up to a cool, windy, drizzling mist. Sugar Gal’s warm clothes were wet so we hung them on our backpacks to dry as we hiked.

The Appalachian Trail was foggy as we trekked a steep climb to the summit of Mount Everett in Massachusetts, but not a bad trek of only one mile. The terrain then became rocky with mud that had a horrible stinky stench, making it hard to find a place to put our feet and trekking poles before our Mt. Race ascend to a tall cairn on the summit guiding the way.

Yes, we giggled with great excitement as we danced, crossing the Connecticut/Massachusetts line, before attempting our climb of Bear Mountain.

A hiker informed us that the terrain was technical on Bear Mountain. We giggle, thinking how bad could this little ole mountain be. So let’s see…technically it’s a technical mountain. It was a grueling mountain climb up and over Bear Mountain. At one point, Swamp Irish asked Sugar Gal if he could take her pack to hoist it over a boulder, before attempting the climb. “You MUST be KIDDING me!? I’m not tall enough to climb it without my pack either.” She giggled because she was out of words of profanity, looked up, looked to the left, looked to the right, looked behind her, and scratched her head because she had been beaten by the mountain and could trek no further. Then she spied a hiker trail through the bushes and began her frustrating trek through the “Australian Bush” and up the rock scramble. “Ouch! Ouch! I made it!!!” Swamp Irish giggled as they were reunited on the Appalachian Trail, trekking onward. Bear Mountain Trivia: Bear Mountain is the highest peak in Connecticut on the Appalachian Trail.

Never quit hiking the Appalachian Trail on a bad day! Well, we have had several bad days and not a town in sight to even allow us to quit!!!

The Appalachian Trail bestowed safe passage on this sunny day of effortless trekking, conquering Mt. Prospect. During our rock climb, we paused to admire Giant Thumb Rock. Go figure…it looked like a giant thumb! We giggled, trekking onward to a level trail.

This was a first for us.  We discovered that this year, Connecticut decided to eliminate stealth sites by covering them with limbs & directing hikers to camp only at shelters and designated campsites. We shook our heads, giggling. Lucky for us, we were able to make it the 13.5 miles from the shelter to the campsite.  
Today’s magical moments on the Appalachian Trail were rushing streams; a gorge without a bridge to trek; a hiker’s trekking pole (later that day we found the matching pole broken among the rock scramble); rock wall fences; pretty little flowers; unique mushrooms; sassafras bushes; rocks, root, and autumn leaves covering the trail; a cemetery with a hiker watering hole; a log staircase; lovely views; a boulder maze; the Housatonic River; and a wheelchair trail that was filled with rocks (bewildering us…hmmm…what a bumpy ride that must be!).

We trekked the charming town of Fall Village, crossed Iron Bridge over the rushing Housatonic River, meandered through the park, and enjoyed a snack at the school’s wall bench before heading to Belters Campsite for the evening.

We had not heard anything about the delightfully quaint Belters Campsite. Exhausted, we snuggled down for the night and giggled as we listened to a high school football game from the valley below.

Our Appalachian Trail alarm clock this morning was chatter and commotion, fighting over who could be the loudest: cicadas chirping, owls hooting, trains rumbling, automobiles zooming, and the babbling stream rushing.

The amazing Appalachian Trail started with shades of yellow lining the foggy mountains in the distance, the misty forest floor sprinkled with pale yellow autumn leaves, white blazes and cat eyes showing the way before daybreak, and a breathtaking sunrise that twinkled through the tree devastation that lined the path.

The terrain had gentle flows of ups and downs, trickling streams to replenish our water supply, a stone spiral staircase wrapping around the hilltop, grassy fields, mosquitoes buzzing, geese flying, a sleeping mouse, frogs leaping, wiggly newts, black walnuts falling, dainty flowers, and colorful mushrooms.

While trekking, I lost a sock that was drying on my pack…Darn! Does Darn Tough replace lost socks? No, just socks with holes!

Today we were entertained by white blaze markings, or the lack of. There were very few white blaze markings on trees leading the southbound hikers. So we were constantly turning around, looking backwards over our shoulder for the northbound markings, to find our way forward. We found white blazes on downed trees, rocks, and the most humorous was a white blaze marking on the loose bark of a tree that had fallen off of the tree. Now we have been informed that no maintenance may be done without the Appalachian Trail Conservancy’s approval. The wise creative volunteer tied the bark back onto the tree with string until they got the approval to buy paint, to replace the white blaze marking. You just can’t make this stuff up, and we’re still giggling over that true fact!

We trekked to Hang Gliders View that you can’t hang glide from, then to a Racetrack View where we couldn’t see because of fog, but we could hear the announcer and the zooms below. Let’s trek on to see what adventures the Appalachian Trail leads us to. The trail detoured, making a new Appalachian Trail which was an excellent trail to trek, even though it was not a well beaten down path.

We arrived at the campsite, set up for the night, replenished our water, and climbed into our warm cozy quilts. Twinkling stars and a full moon illuminated the townhouse tent. We snuggled into the arms of the Appalachian Trail, giggling because we have lost weight and could fit through the Cracked Boulder we called Pecan Cracker, while cicadas sang us to sleep!!","Belters Campsite, Connecticut

Do you have cell service? What is today’s weather forecast? “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs”…make that a rain storm at 5:00 this evening. Up we got and off did trot, carrying our packs behind us.

Today we trekked the flows of ups and downs with a few rock scrambles, a flat easy path along the Housatonic River, and then we came to Silver Hills Campsite. Break Time!’ There is no shelter, but a lovely place to sit to see the nothing view, because the trees grew up around it. We were just swinging on the swing looking at nothing, gigging as we took a honey bun break.

The Appalachian Trail adventures included a snake slithering across the trail; tiny frogs leaping and tiny black crickets jumping off the trail welcoming us to the fields along the river; many streams with charming little waterfalls; and a hornet’s nest hanging over the trail. We giggled softly, quietly walking away!

Arriving at the shelter early, we laid out our sleeping pads and quilts in the shelter to stay high and dry for the night, ate a yummy supper, and tucked our bear bags safely in the bear box. Hiker OJ shared upcoming terrain and amazing hiker ideas, making us giggle before he and other hikers opted to set up in the lovely little tent sites. We started to drift into a peaceful slumber on the Appalachian Trail to the tranquil tapping of raindrops on the roof, when we heard hikers. Soaking wet, the Bennett's giggled as they came in out of the rain, choosing the shelter for they were celebrating their 25 Wedding Anniversary on the Appalachian Trail!!

It rained until midnight last night, and then the winds began to blow. It is amazing that shelter openings face the right direction, keeping the rains and winds at bay, thanks to the ATC. The croaks and ribbits of frogs at the Housatonic River were our sweet serenading alarm clock, waking us up to a foggy cold morning, ready to trek to St. John’s Ledges. We giggle because we are sure the ledges were named after Sugar Gal’s Dad…a wise saint.

We are loving the Appalachian Trail this morning as we make record time, trekking flat terrain along the river, hiking two and a half miles in one hour! The Appalachian Trail has a way of rearing its ugly head bringing the flatland to the base of Saint John's Ledges to a screeching halt. Holy Moly! Thanks AT!

St John’s Ledges Trivia: A trek on the Appalachian Trail near Kent, Connecticut, of flat ledges and cliffs opening up lovely views of the surrounding mountains and valley below. They’re well known to rock climbers throughout the region. However, it was not our life’s dream to become rock climbers…just stinky hikers.

Holy Moly! Trivia: “Holy Moly!” is a phrase used to express an element of surprise, amazement, or bewilderment. Dates back to the 1800s according to the dictionary in my phone. Meaning: Heavens to Betsy (also the 1800s), What the Heck, Good Golly Ms Molly, Are You Serious, O’ Brother, Really! Really!, Hark, Element of Surprise, etc.

Looking straight up, Swamp Irish made an executive decision to enjoy a honey bun before climbing the rocks. He is a very wise man/hiker! Sugar Gal was contemplating…Can we skip this portion of the Appalachian Trail and cheat on the miles?...nope…not us…we don’t cheat…we’ve come this far and we are going the distance! We giggled! The terrain was a torturous vertical rock slab scramble going straight up for a half mile to St John’s Ledges. Sugar Gal had to hoist her pack over the boulders only once. Dang, that took an hour and a half…so much for making good time. We giggled once we got to the top, then ate a danish. For our accomplishments, the Appalachian Trail bestowed upon us terrain of flat and easy ups and downs, bridges over streams, boardwalks, occasional gentle refreshing rains, and a New Restoration Trail (adding more mileage…see, we could have skipped the climb…I’m just saying).

Another scramble?! We trekked a miniature boulder climb when we spied a message just for us. 1,900 was the magical number the Appalachian Trail has given us! We giggled, sang, and danced around the large rock, taking pictures!

White Flower Fairies near the spring took time out of their busy schedule to pass the word to the Granite Fairies near St. John’s Ledges that we would be celebrating 1,900 miles of hiking! The Appalachian Trail helped us celebrate our special day with easy terrain and AT carvings.

Today was a special day filled with many amazing adventures on the Appalachian Trail! You never know what magical wonders await you. We giggled and drifted off into a sweet peaceful slumber as the bright moonlight illuminated the campsite area to celebrate our 1,900 miles on the Appalachian Trail!!","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter, Connecticut

Chattering cicadas near the stream were our alarm clock on this chilly morning.

The Appalachian Trail delighted us with a gorgeous rainbow of colors: sunrise, vivid autumn leaves carpeting the forest floor, and white blaze markings on slab rock ridges. Today the trail had water hand pumps (the handles were removed to prevent hikers from getting sick because someone wanted them to test the water. I thought that is what the Sawyer water filtration was for? Oh Well!). We also found uniquely shaped mushrooms, snakes slithering down the trail, geese, chipmunks, crows, squirrels, frogs, crickets, stone staircase, and AT carvings. The Appalachian Trail reminded us it has a sense of humor, granting us an AT relocation trail, adding 2 extra miles.

Bull’s Bridge is a quaint little covered bridge over the rushing Housatonic River. The highlight of our day was crossing the bridge before resupplying in Kent, Connecticut, at Bull’s Bridge Road Store. We are out of food and our electronics are near death. The young lady at the store was very nice to all the stinky hikers, informing us of amenities, allowing us to replenish our water supply and recharge electronics for free. We giggled with hiker Lex, ate a hot lunch, and resupplied.

The trail meandered back and forth, crossing the New York/Connecticut borders.

Trekking to the shelter we replenished our water, discovered a trail magic Backpackers Pantry meal, set up our townhouse tent on a lovely tent platform, and giggled with hiker Mike. Snuggling in our warm cozy sleeping quilts, we giggled because we’re finally in New York, enjoying magical moments on the Appalachian Trail!!","Schaghticoke Mtn Campsites, Connecticut

On this cold morning we had the breakfast of champions before we started our trek: cranberry oatmeal and a mini Milky Way in our hot Chocolate. Yum!

The Appalachian Trail’s magical journey gifted us with a well-maintained trail, beautiful sunrise, Christmas Tree mushroom cluster, an array of lovely ruffled mushrooms, boardwalks through swamps, a refreshing waterfall, stone fences along the trail, autumn leaves, trail magic hiker gear, scenic views, AT carvings, hunters in the area, cattle crossings, open fields with crickets, time to stop to hug a tree, field trip at the landscape nursery, water silo, Tarzan’s vine tunnel jungle, crows, geese, chipmunks and squirrels gathering acorns. If a tree falls in the woods, does it make noise? Yes it does! We’ve now witnessed a tree fall, creating a thunderous crash, and that saddened our hearts.

An “Ahh” moment was when we paused to admire Dover Oak’s majestic beauty!! Dover Oak Trivia: Dover Oak is the largest oak tree on the Appalachian Trail and is over 300 years old.

Hikers Freebird, Face Plant, Brendan, and Eric from Eric’s Maple Farm shared a wealth of upcoming terrain information.

Telephone Pioneers Shelter didn’t have a tent site area, so we gathered water from the stream before continuing our trek to the summit of West Mountain where we found a quaint little stealth site. Exhausted, we mentioned, “We don’t even care whether or not we care” and this is the perfect place to set up for the evening. Relaxing and enjoying a gentle breeze on the Appalachian Trail, we giggled at nearby day hikers howling at the full moon and admired the view of Pawling’s twinkling town lights under the sparkling stars and luminous moon!!","Wiley Shelter, New York

The Appalachian Trail was showing off for us today with a breathtaking sunrise, boardwalks through bogs, autumn leaves carpeting the trail, stone fences along the path, head banger and knee knocker trees, several railroad crossings, a honey bun break, curly mushrooms, ponds reflecting spectacular autumn colors, trekkable (is that a word…it is now) rocks and roots, footbridges over trickling streams, and wooden staircases. The trail meandered along Nuclear Lake, which has freaky fish, so do not drink the water!

Nuclear Lake Trivia: According to signs near the lake, you may swim in the lake but you may not drink the water in the lake. Giggling, we trekked onward…and didn’t do either.

There’s never a dull moment on the Appalachian Trail as it tries to keep its hikers safe. Stopping for lunch at Morgan Steward Shelter, we met a discombobulated (our friend, Ms Melissa’s favorite word) day hiker with his dog looking for the east and west white blaze markings. The Appalachian Trail’s white blazes do not go east and west, only north and south, even for people with their stinky dogs and they are not experienced enough to know that white blazes only go north and south on the Appalachian Trail! We giggled, trying to send him in the right direction as he yelled at us…“What Ever!” Dude, get a life and chill. (Maybe we should not have laughed so hard.) About 30 minutes later, we met the day hiker again, thinking…“You can’t fix Stupid!” We started to hide in the bushes…oh yeah, we’re on a cliff’s edge with no bushes. You should never judge a book by its cover and you should never judge a hiker by a first impression. Unbeknownst to us, the hiker was a working law enforcement officer and his dog was part of the K9 Unit, looking for Brian Laundrie (from Florida). They went by the names Just Rick and K9. We thanked them for keeping hikers safe on the Appalachian Trail, but we are still giggling over the east and west white blaze markers to nowhere.

Trek faster! Once again, the autumn leaves have begun to hide the Appalachian Trail as they are putting the path to sleep for a long winter’s nap. While beautiful, the leaves cover damp rocks and roots, causing treacherous terrain. At times, we only have white blazes on the trees to guide the way.

We giggled, walking into the parking lot near Stormville, New York, because we are going into town for pizza! A gentleman asked us if we needed a ride. Giggling, we said Yes! After heading to town he informed us that he was sitting in the parking lot waiting for a hiker to come by, oh and by the way his doors on the vehicle were broken and he’ll have to open them once we arrive in town. We both reached for the doors and sure enough we were locked in. The Giggling Stopped! We Are Going to DIE!!! Why do hikers trust everyone?!?! Jerry drove us 2 miles into town, opened our doors, wished us well, and drove away...a Trail Angel. There was a great sigh of relief! The giggling started again.

The Mountaintop Market is an amazing store. The owner welcomed us, letting us know that there was a place to set up camp behind the store near the picnic table (a luxury), charging station (well needed), and faucet (a real plus for us) to replenish our water supply outside the building.

We enjoyed delicacies of pizza, snacks, and drinks before climbing into our warm comfy quilts. Snuggling down for the night had us giggling about our very adventurous day, east and west white blazes, sights of the breathtaking mountain views, milkweed pods bursting as their puffs float away into the cool breeze, and a colorful sunset peeking through the tree lines of the surrounding mountains.

The delightful distractions of the Appalachian Trail have not blinded us to its dangerous terrain. After great discussion, we will be leaving the Appalachian Trail upon finishing this southern section of our trek!!","Rocky Outcrop of West Mountain, New York

The rumbling, grinding sounds of the cement plant nearby were our alarm clock on this cold morning. “To the winch, wench!”…make that the trail!

We enjoyed breakfast at the Mountaintop Market before leaving for the trail and thanked them for their kindness.

The Appalachian Trail sent us to a remarkable haven, then graciously provided a breathtaking sunrise as we trekked, huffing and puffing, along the mountain’s edge over rocky terrain covered with colorful autumn leaves. We followed creatively painted white blazes on trees, pointed rocks, roots, broken stumps, and stone fences along the path.

All this creativity made us feel lucky so we began singing “How Lucky Can One Person Be” by Dean Martin as we trekked and giggled. The leaves are falling and covering the ground causing a thinning through the treetops so we can see more sunshine. We enjoyed wiggly earthworms, a fleeing deer, dogs barking, cars zooming on the road below, a house under construction next to the trail, our last honey bun, log staircases, and lovely farm views below.

Throughout the morning, we crossed paths and giggled with hiker Shaggy, making our way to the parkway.

We do not feel a great accomplishment…as we glance over our shoulders, we realize we have completed connecting the dots, arriving at our destination: Taconic State Parkway near Ralph’s Peak Hikers Cabin, New York.

Standing on the wooden bridge giggling, we gazed into each other’s eyes, grasping hands, our hearts pounding, thanking each other for staying by each other’s side. 1 9 5 3, nineteen fifty three. It sounds so much better when you say one thousand nine hundred and fifty three miles trekked on the Appalachian Trail.

The shuttle driver chatted and giggled, but the words seemed so far, far away. We slowly removed our backpacks, placing them gently into the back of the shuttle, took our sweet time sliding onto the seats, and held hands watching the Appalachian Trail slip out of sight as tears trickled down our cheeks, giggling. Our amazing journey on the Appalachian Trail has become “The NeverEnding Story,” which has enriched our minds and mesmerized our souls!!

There is that moment in time, when you realize that life has magically touched your heart upon trekking 1,953 miles on the Appalachian Trail. Today was filled with such moments!!","Mountain Market Deli & Pizza Stealth, New York
