Greenlight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521141,"Have you ever woken up one day to decide that you were going to hike the Appalachian Trail? Me neither. While it was an epiphany, it didn't happen overnight. The trigger was that I turned fifty and realized that while I loved the outdoors growing up and was in a very active Boy Scout troop for six years, I raised four children with only a handful of fishing and camping excursions. I vowed that I'd make up for the thirty years of sloth by making sure the next thirty years are exceptional. I can't go back and correct my mistakes, but I do believe that it is never too late to start doing the right thing.And I got lucky, too. My oldest son decided he'd join me on the AT thru-hike. I mean, he is really into it and he blogs over at http://freerangehiking.comThe boy is a post-traumatic Afghanistan combat vet, a medic and on-site medical dude for the planet's largest online retailer. He's already chosen his career path with them, and they will support his thru-hike with a package of paid and unpaid leave, as well as the opportunity to cash in some employee purchased company stocks. I've put in my profile details that we'll be hiking in 2020, but that is the latest date we will complete it, hopefully we'll get everything lined up much sooner than that. As soon as I can get the cash socked aside to pay my bills for four months and have enough left over to purchase food for the trail, I'll be on trail the following April 1st. That may be 2017 but definitely before 2021.To fill in the time between then and now, the boy and I are hiking dern near every weekend in the southern Indiana state parks. There are some good training hills down there, and once things green up this spring, we'll be pulling quite a few over-nighters. I'll update anyone who wishes to follow our journey with preparation entries and let you know how I ended up financing this trip and when our ultimate start date is. Some of those training hikes (joyful affairs in and of themselves!) will be conducted on the AT and longer U.S. trails, and I insist that I receive my trail name on the AT - I'm sure that will be an interesting post all by itself. I'll let you know when I've been re-christened.",,Mt. Living Room,"Feb 14, Sun",0
Greenlight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521255,"I didn't realize the magnitude of the decision I'd made until, sitting next to the my Jetboil, tucked into the scrubby winter undergrowth beside a creek somewhere in Morgan Monroe State Forest, my phone pinged it's ""you've got a text"" alert and I swiped the screen to see that my youngest son's high school was on a two hour delay. It was twenty degrees. We'd gotten a couple of inches of snow. It didn't seem like a big deal to me or my oldest son, who was with, me eating a rehydrated main course from a cold weather MRE he'd brought along. More evidence of the wussification of America? I asked. He laughed.We'd planned this trip a couple of weeks before, and I thought the info on the Three Lakes Trail said it was rated ""moderate."" Now just halfway through the ten and a half miler the sun was threatening to set and we had a decision to make. Keep hiking in the dark and snow with our headlamps or bed down for the night in an area listed as ""no back country camping."" We started the hike at 2 p.m. thinking we'd still have enough light at 7 p.m. to throw our gear in the truck, drive down the road to the Low Gap trail head and hike in the mile or so to the established campsite where the 10 mile Low Gap Trail intersected the 40+ mile Tecumseh Trail.There really wasn't a choice to make. If the second segment of the trail was as rugged as the first, there would be no night hiking for us. We set up camp, ate, and bedded down by 7:30 p.m. and were snoring by 8. Until the coyotes starting howling. Evidently February is coyote mating month, and we were camping on Valentine's Day. The call and response across the ridges and valleys as I lay cocooned in my North Face Furnace mummy sack inside an REI Passage 1 tent was more exciting than any thriller back home on the TV. I didn't feel threatened, though my son and I confessed to each other that we were both hoping and dreading the sounds getting nearer. It wasn't constant. There were four or five episodes of four part coyote choir between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. with a couple of hours in between each performance. Periodic snow showers sent flakes down through the bare branches of the hardwoods to slide individually down my tent fly, and only one time did I hear a smaller critter outside my tent during the night. Son and I were both careful to seal up all remnants of food after dinner and stow them away in zip locked freezer bags deep in our packs, so foraging varmints weren't going to have very successful raids in our little camp.I emerged from my tent at a little before 6 a.m. after quietly brewing some coffee in my JetBoil and munching on cold Maple and Bacon Pop Tarts from the warmth of my sleeping bag, took care of mother nature's call, and built up a small twig fire to warm myself by before we broke camp and hit the trail to finish up our hike. We broke camp quickly, returning the site as close as possible to it's pre-campsite condition as we could, except for our snow tracks. There aren't many places on the Three Lakes Trail that are flat for any amount of time. The second half of the hike was shorter than the first. It was also more difficult terrain to cover. When we walked out onto the road by the shelter we parked near, a DNR truck pulled up to meet us. A friendly, towering employee got out and asked if that was our Silverado parked in the pull-off a couple hundred feet away. Son confirmed it was his. ""I was worried about you...didn't know if you were having engine problems or what was going on."" ""Nah, we were hiking the Three Lakes Trail"" I said.""But your truck has been there since late yesterday afternoon,"" he said.""Well, we started at 2 p.m. yesterday and thought we'd be out well before the sun went down, seeing how the trail is only rated moderate.""""Moderate?"" he said with a chuckle. ""That's one of the most difficult trails in the state. It's rated rugged.""""That would explain it,"" my son said. ""That thing kicked our butts.""We went on to explain our predicament, with the sun threatening to set on us only six miles into the hike. How we improv'd a campsite and hunkered down. He explained how there was no camping allowed on that trail, and how a conservation officer could have fined us $200 each for the infraction. We apologized profusely and thanked him for not pulling out a ticket book. I think he was just relieved that he didn't have to go looking for the owners of the truck since we'd instead emerged from the wood line unscathed but for some tired legs and a bit of back sweat. He looked at our fully loaded packs.""We're doing training hikes to tackle the A.T.,"" we said. ""If we're hiking in a suburban park or a state forest, they're on our backs.""He got back into his truck and headed back the way he'd come and we tossed our gear back into the Silverado and fist-bumped each other. That, was a great. Hike. We sipped on slushy Gatorades from the console of his truck as we waited for the windshield to defrost and went back to our normal lives.Lessons: Obviously we still stink of newbie pheromones, but with each hike we're learning more and getting better. I think we'll be better off, from the eight miles from civilization to Springer Mountain, when we get to that glory day when our 2200 mile adventure finally begins. But truth be told, the adventure has already begun. Every impression my boot tread leaves anywhere on a trail, I'm happy. Happy isn't even the right world.

Greenlight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526410,"It rocks your feet inside your boots. That’s what I told myself six miles in, sitting in my hammock at the Dahlgren Backpacker’s Camp after my first time on the Appalachian Trail. I was so proud of my Merrell Moab Ventilator hiking boots with green Superfeet inserts and merino wool blend socks, and while I have no blisters to report, I have to give the first round to the AT. I lay in that hammock, listening to the wind rolling up the hills and swaying two trees that rubbed and brushed together making a sound like laughter, and fell asleep like a baby in a cradle.The excursion began with the traffic jam that is the beltway in the afternoon. It took two hours to get to Frederick, Maryland from my room south of old town Alexandria, but I finally rolled into the trailhead and changed out of work clothes and into hiker trash attire in the front seat of the car. It was a quarter after six by the time I stood in front of the hiker’s overpass on I-70. I entered with a sense of excitement and reverence, disappearing into the wood line atop the flinty rocks that would remind me that I had feet.I still tend to over-dress at the beginning of a hike, such as the unnecessary black jacket I was wearing. As I started to climb Bartman Hill on the west side of I-70 in South Mountain Environmental Area, a trail running couple and their dog passed me in the opposite direction. The man seemed military by his haircut and demeanor, plus he was carrying a coyote military day bag. We passed so quickly there was only time for a short greeting. I don’t aspire to trail running, but I was swinging my trekking poles at a pretty good clip. I wanted to get in as many miles as I could on this my first on The Long Trail. Bartman peaks out at 1400 feet, and my GPS told me at the halfway point that I’d gone up 1000 feet and descended 1200. That is enough to blow the cobwebs out of your lungs, and make you pull off any odd jackets that might be covering your torso and stuff them in your pack.The woods were thick with deer, and they looked huge. Three of them skirted me on the IMG_1728east at one point, followed by another a minute later. It seems that everyone wants to see bears, or in Bryson’s case he didn’t want to be molested by one. I would have been at a loss had I encountered one at that point because my back was pressed tight against a tree as the remains of a McDonalds lunch ran into a cat hole between my shaking white legs. I could partially blame it on my excitement of finally being on the AT, but that’s a crappy symbolic present to leave behind for the Maryland wildlife.Bartman descends to a road crossing, and you pick up two more hills before the trail places you on Monument Knob in Washington Monument State Park. Earl Shaffer mentions the “original” Washington Monument built by the people of Boonboro and later restored by the CCC. It was recently struck by lightning and they’ve got it engineer fencing around it until they can make it safe again, so I wasn’t able to climb the staircase to the top.Washington Monument was a decisive place for me. I stood in the parking lot drinking water and plotting out my next move. I wanted miles, but in the gloaming, all by myself, I had no idea where I’d lay my head that night. My hands went to the top left pocket of my pack to grab my head lamp, which I put on and turned on. And I walked.I walked up another hill and switchbacked down the other side into Turners Gap. The cool air felt good on my skin as I hiked through the darkness while my little lamp searched out the white blazes. Head lamp hiking seems to be a skill acquired by much practice, and though I never fell, I did roll my ankle once. My poles saved me. When it is dark and your legs are getting tired, you don’t pick your feet up as high, and you kick rocks. When you do that, your toes make you say bad words. My advice to you is that when you night hike, you make a concerted effort to pick your feet up and place them carefully. Even with shoes or boots on, sometimes kicking a rock on the trail is like stubbing your toe on a bedpost.At the bottom of the switchbacks, the woods opens up into a grassy field and the blazes are on brown, six-foot high stakes. The light from my headlamp bounced off of a structure. It was the back side of a stone church. Across the street, a couple was leaving the Old South Mountain Inn (Food and Drink for All). There were still a few people inside, so I stowed my pack in the bushes by their stone patio and went in to the bar and asked if I could get a beer and a trip to the privy. Even though they were technically closed, they served me and allowed me to use the facilities.People on the east coast are tickled because Bell’s Two Hearted Ale is available there now. It’s always been one of my favorite brews. It tasted especially magical sitting there chatting with the bartender at an establishment that serendipitously appeared at the edge of a big woods which you have just night hiked through.I picked up the trail again wondering how far I’d have to hike until I came to a shelter. I found out in two-tenths of a mile, which is exactly where I found Dahlgren Backpacker Campground, already occupied by three tents and a hammock. I added a second hammock and crashed until I got the urge in the middle of the night to wet the port-o-john. I tried to fight off the urge until sunrise, but keeping pee warm really saps your body heat. I got up, did my wet work, and climbed back into my nest and instantly fell back to sleep.The occupants in the tent across the lawn from me began to stir at sun up, simultaneously cooking breakfast and tearing down. I broke out my JetBoil to brew a double coffee and munched on maple bacon Pop Tarts while chatting. The older one said he’d completed a thru hike in 2003, and he was shrinking the learning curve for his younger friend. They’d come from Harper’s Ferry and were continuing northbound. They cleared out as I was finishing my breakfast. I broke camp as the rest of campers began to stir, but caught up to them again near a huge rock outcropping. The younger hiker was directing his friend to look around the biggest rock.“Geocaching?” I asked as I stopped for water.IMG_1680“Yeah, I was explaining it to him as we were hiking, he’d never done it before.”“He’s going to get hooked and really slow your pace down, you know” I said, laughing.He scrambled up the hill to help his friend look for the cache and I hiked on.On the return to Monument Knob, I shared a water station with a Papa Sprout, a hiker who has completed from Springer Mountain to Front Royal, with plans to complete to Katahdin in sections. I wished him happy hiking and enjoyed the level grade until the trail left the confines of the park. I still had a lot of energy to burn up on trails when Bartman appeared ahead and I realized that my first go on the AT was coming to an end. I crossed the residential road where the trail continues between two houses and down a small erosion control stairway constructed of landscaping timbers and back to the hiker’s overpass across I-70. I stood there defiant, not wanting the excursion to end, but it did.I tossed my pack into the back of the car and as quickly as it had begun, it ended.I’ll be back.",,Dahlgren Backpacker's Camp,"Mar 31, Thu",7
Greenlight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526411,"Hey, howzit’ goin’? I’m Greenlight.When we headed into the Great Smoky Mountains on the border between Tennessee and North Carolina, Aaron and I went with the intention of getting our trail names, on the Appalachian Trail, that we will use when we eventually thru-hike the AT.Aaron wants his bestowed spontaneously. I’m more of an opportunist. But there we were, bearing down on Mount Collins Shelter where we’d spend Saturday night. We could smell wood smoke a mile-and-a-half away and knew we were getting close. The shelter is a half-mile off the AT on a side path, and we were told by Firecracker, the first thru-hiker we met on the trail, that there probably wouldn’t be many thru-hikers at Mount Collins because thru-hikers don’t like burning unnecessary miles.It was, however, a cold and windy night. There were a couple of thru-hikers at the shelter as well as a bunch of section hikers. With Aaron, and me the shelter was completely full. As we were pulling out our food bags and preparing to eat, with the sun going down, I pulled my Browning head lamp out of my pack and turned it on. Scoping out the inside of the shelter and looking around outside for a place to cook my dinner, I figured that my lamp was too bright and probably annoying people as it shined in the their eyes as I passed by.Half of the shelter occupants had already eaten and were in various states of awake and asleep as they lay on the two tiers of sleeping spaces. I adjusted the light so that it was only emitting a soft green glow. Others were doing the same thing with their lights; all of their “low beam” colors were red. Coming around the side of the shelter, one of the thru-hikers mentioned off-handedly to me, “Hey dude, I like your green light.”I didn’t think anything of it at the time, but as I was drifting off that night (before having to get up at 3 a.m. in nothing but my boots, compression shorts and down jacket to pee) I wondered how active I should be in the solicitation of a trail name. The first thing I did after making a double coffee in my JetBoil the next morning and downing the last of my maple bacon toaster pastries was to gather some firewood and attempt to get the fire started in the shelter fireplace. Having a full can of Zippo lighter fluid in my fire kit helped the process. The two thru-hikers were stirring and I asked which one of them had said he liked my green light last night. The younger one sporting dreads and a friendly “dude” attitude fessed up.“Do you think that would work for a trail name?” I asked him. “Greenlight. I sort of like that.”“That or maybe … Green Lantern” he joked.“Oh, hell no! I gasped. Maybe Deadpool but please, not Green Lantern!”It was agreed. My trail name would be Greenlight.I like the fact that I didn’t decide single-handedly what my trail name would be. I like that it was negotiated on my second section hike of the AT itself, which will eventually become my home for four or five months in the not-so-distant future. And lastly, I like that it was the result of give-and-take with current thru-hikers.Most people in the world have never heard of the Appalachian Trail. Of the ones who have, only a small subset give a rat’s ass how I got my trail name, or that I have one at all.For me, though, it is important. It moves me one step closer to a dream. Not the dream of beginning, but rather of standing atop Katahdin and saying, with Grandma Gatewood, “I said I’d do it, and I’ve done it.”",,Mount Collins Shelter,"Apr 03, Sun",10
