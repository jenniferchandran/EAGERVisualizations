Process,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627336,"Since the summer of 2019 I have been hiking with my brother in law (Chuck 61).  He retired 2 yrs ago and lives in Northern Va.  He decided somewhere in the fall of 2019 to Thru-hike the AT in 2020.  I decided to do some training/shakedown hikes with him. We both live close to the AT in N.VA, WV, and Md. We did several day hikes in sections like the famed “Roller Coaster.” We have done several multi-day and overnight sections having done most of MD and about 30 miles in the Shenandoah Park.  In January, we decided his start time to be Friday the 13th!  I took time off from work to do the first five days beginning at Springer Mt  Here begins my story...",,View Entry,"Jan 14, Tue",0

Process,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627341,"Started at Springer Mt. parking lot in a light rain and low visibility with a temp of 57.  About half way to summit Chuck slipped on a sloped rock and slid down on his side, landing on his knee and hiking pole.  Knee later became sore near end of day.  Hiking pole broken,but fixed with tent stakes and duct tape!  Adapt-Improvise and overcome!!  At Summit of Springer Chuck signed trail log and snapped a few quick pics and we were headed NOBO...Finally!  Chuck was headed in the right direction and his first steps on a wonderful journey to Katahdin.  
   Received trail magic back at Springer parking lot by a few guys finishing a gear shakedown and we continued on in new territory.  The rain stopped and fog clear and big red tried to shine thru.   Passed a guy with full pack wearing flip flops...he was going slooooow.  We knocked out a quick 3 miles and took off our rain gear at Stover creek and met Cory from Canada.  The old guys were moving fast and enjoyed a beautiful walk along stover creek among the Rhododendron.  We stopped for lunch at mile 6 and met Moxie, an ATC Ridge Runner, she was doing her rounds and checking on the trail and its “Hiker Trash”.  Yes, Chuck is now officially Hiker Trash (Term of endearment among thru hikers).  We finished off the day with a short but moderate climb to our stealth campsite finishing with 10 total miles but only 9 official AT miles.   Congrats Pop Pop on a great first day. Love ya man!   We did camp chores and are in our tents at 1830hrs (6:30pm).  One other hiker shuffled into our site to camp. His name is Mark from Wisconsin.  Maybe we will name him Badger.  He is an older retired guy prob near 65.  Weather is currently 55. No rain expected with low of 49.  We shall see...

   It was fairly warm first night with temp about 50 and clear.   Owls and coyotes noisy, but Chuck heard nothing over his snoring.   We got day started at 0600 with coffee and a beautiful sunrise.  God blessed us with a great first day and night.   Got on trail at 0830. We planned for 0800 but Scott thought a nature call was in order and left the coyotes a package!!   Anyway, we saw a lot more hikers today.  Timberwolf and Terri (No Name), Mike, and 5 college kids on spring break and more later at Gooch Shelter where we ate lunch.  We started with a clear day but after 5.5 miles while filtering water at lovely Justus Creek it began raining.  It was steady for about an hour and cold.  We dried out with other Hiker Trash at Gooch Shelter.  Everyone is nice but it’s like first week of school...still seeing who will sit with Chuck at lunch table.  After warming up and fueling up we departed for our campsite and as we descended upon Gooch Gap we saw two canopies set up just off the trail.   Someone yelled, “Hikers, come take a break!”  Yay!! The first real trail magic put on by two former thru hikers...Freestyle and Old Gray.  They had drinks, hamburgers, hotdogs, fruit, and more.   Of course, we had just eaten but not wanting to offended we ate a hamburger (soooo good) and a plum.  Music was playing and it was so cool that people give back to the AT community.  Thanks guys for the TMagic!!   10 miles today. They were definitely harder miles today and tomorrow will be harder with Blood Mountain challenging us.   Camp is set up and it is drizzling on the tents.  Chuck and I are chilling in our tents listening to the Army Rangers shooting weapons during their Mountain phase of training near Gooch Gap.  Dinner soon, Vitamin I and bed.  We are on Ramrock Mt with 19 trail miles behind us!!  
Addendum—Big Red visited Ramrock campsite.  We enjoyed vista and sun. Everything dried out for now.  We stayed up late tonight...1900hrs.  Hoping to be on trail by 0800 and get picked up for night on the town in Helen, Ga by our personal Trail Angels Jana and Amy.  Blood Mountain challenge first though.  It’s a process!!","

Process,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627349,"Rain and wind on Ramrock Mountain most of night but stopped just as we exited tents at 0630hrs.  Tents and gear dry.  Coffee and camp breakdown process completed in one hour.  On trail by 0745.   We hiked 1.5 miles and filtered water in a pretty spot along trail.  Continued on toward the ominous Blood Mountain.   Just after Woods Gap Scott decided to freestyle off trail up a rock scramble.  I had to take off my pack and toss it to Chuck to extricate myself off the slick rocks.  After finding a white blaze we continued up up up.  Rain and wind on and off but fairly mild temps.  Saw very few hikers, mostly  day hikers except Ken and Caleb.  We stopped and ate lunch in a cold rain as chef Chuck made peanut butter tacos.  We ate quickly and wanted to hike...If you’re cold—Hike faster.  Chuck’s second favorite saying.  
   As we came within 4 miles or so of Blood Mountain we had a series of ups and downs that trended up (like the stock market before Covid 19).  They were difficult and draining especially knowing we still had a steep summit to Blood Mt.  The trail was slick and thick with mud.  It slowed us in some spots.  We trudged up the final steep 700’ with many stone steps.  We felt good about ourselves as we passed a lady in her 70’s (It’s the little things).     At the summited we were greeted by Caleb (From Maine) and Ken (section hiking).  We rested took a few pics and headed off the windy mount towards Neel gap where Jana and Amy were meeting us.  It was a rocky steep descent. About half way down Chuck decide he wanted to snap another hiking pole by slipping on a mud covered rock and landing on his....pack and rolling.  Pride and tailbone bruised and new trek poles in his future we carried on.  Numb feet carried us into Neel gap for a 13 mile day.  31.3 total trail miles.   Holed up in Helen, Ga.  Laundry done (Thx Jana and Amy) and bellies full.   God bless and goodnight.","Ramrock Mountain

It’s a cool place with lots of shops.  The “women folk” as Chuck refers to them went to Dollar General, Chuck and I walked back to our hotel (Heidi Inn). We noticed a tattoo shop.  Chuck suggested we get tattoos...”Chuck and Scott Blood Mountain Forever.” Hmmm it was temping, but after a good nights sleep we agreed it was prob a bad idea.  
   We had a delicious breakfast at Hofer Cafe and I packed out three donuts only one actually made it to the trail.  The ladies drove us back to Neel gap and we geared up in a cold foggy and windy parking lot. It never really warmed up today and the fog held on better than Chuck gripping a Snickers Bar.  We put in 6 miles and stopped for lunch on a wind protected ridge line. Chef Pop Pop or formerly known as D.C fixed us a Steve Johnson favorite with one extra topping...Blackberry and Strawberry Jelly procured from Hofer Cafe.   Hiker Trash will pocket unsecured condiments!!!  I just want to give Sir Fob (Steve Johnson) a shout-out.  Fob thanks for your books and friendship to Chuck. I think you have had a big influence on Chuck and I wanting to hike the AT.  I have enjoyed your journey and writings. Two thumbs up! After lunch we did an hour challenge and walked 2.8 miles that contained a few ups and lots of mud.  The pic of Chuck in the fog was at the end of that hour. 
   Not many hikers today. We are presently camped with Birdman and Kyle both from Michigan but not hiking together.  We finished off today with 12.8 miles and 44.1 total miles.   We are all tired and Chuck’s 3rd favorite line, “It’s Hard, It’s supposed to be hard!”  God Bless","

Yes!!!!  Which brings me to Chuck’s fourth favorite trail saying, I love the smell of burning cow!”   We crossed the road, dropped our packs, kissed the wives, and scarfed down a burger and a hotdog with a coke.  Thank you Baptist church from Lakeland, FL for the TMagic.  Then Chuck drank a Fanta and I had 2 or 3 donuts.  I lost count (hey don’t judge me).   The ladies were worried we might not want to eat lunch.  No prob by the time we drove 15 minutes and showered we were ready to eat again.  Keep The Pop Pop in your prayers, he heads out tomorrow trekking solo. He’s a strong hiker and a great trail companion.  Gonna miss our time together.  Love you Chuck.  God Bless","

We were both a little sad...well, I know I was not to be headed up to Tray Mountain and beyond.   We said our good-byes and watched Chuck climb out of the gap.  I yelled, “It’s a Process” and He yelled back, “It’s hard” I echoed, “It’s suppose to be hard.” With that we made the journey back to WV.  Jana will head to Manassas in the morning.  We had a good safe trip home.  
   Two hours into the journey I was checking Guthook (AT GPS map App) and calculated Pops was getting close to summiting Tray Mountain.  30 minutes later we got a text from Pops that he had summited and was moving on.  Later around 3pm we received another text that he was stopped for the night at Deep Gap Shelter.  He had his biggest mileage AT day 13.1 with 65.6 total miles.  Keep it up brother.  
     On the way home.  I said, “I wish I could thru hike with Chuck”. Amy said, “then do it!”   So I decided after talking it over with Amy and Jana. To go for it. So decided to resign from my job and pick up with Chuck at Fontana Dam in two weeks.  Stay tuned...","Unicoi Gap

Process,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628488,"Since my last entry many things have taken place in the world and in my personal life. After hiking from Harper’s Ferry, WV southbound with Chuck we made the decision to come off the trail after four days.  We had mixed emotions and with Covid looming we thought it best to postpone our thru hike.  So now what was I gonna do??  Thanks to some providential workings and with my daughter’s help I signed with a disaster relief staffing company called Krucial Staffing and was mobilized to New York City working as a Respiratory Therapist  I was assigned to nightshift at historic Bellevue Hospital (Oldest hospital in the US).  This was Covid Central and it was like nothing I have ever experienced. I can only say great things of the staff at Bellevue and how they deserve to be recognized for all their dedication and hard-work.   I send a huge shout out to all the travelers.  What a great team of RTs we made to make it happen to save lives and support each other.   I love each and everyone of you. God Bless!  
    My contract here is coming to a close after 11 weeks.  So now what???  Chuck and I are making plans to continue our thru hike starting July 1st.  We are planning to start in Harper’s Ferry and head Northbound towards Maine. We have three months to make it to Baxter State Park before it closes.  Then we will head back to Unicoi Gap GA and head north to Morgan Mill Rd in Virginia.  I appreciate Chuck for keeping the dream alive and keeping my spirits up while I’ve been in NYC.  I will be back in WV June 17 and decompress for 2 weeks before putting on my pack.   It’s a Process!!","NYC

The young man was a military veteran. Chuck and I appreciate all those who have served our country and all those who keep us safe whether here or abroad.   Weverly overlooks the Shenandoah River and three states (VA, WV, and MD).

     We were excited to get started in new territory and cross Md off our list of 14 states. The weather was perfect the entire day.  Sunny and temp of 81 with a nice breeze.  After saying our goodbyes at Raven Rock Rd, PopPop and I climbed a steep section that faked us out several times. We climbed 800’ to 2165’ and it finally leveled off, but then turned rocky. Md was not through with us yet...she had some tricks up her sleeve and this was the hardest section in the Blue Crab State.  We had lunch at High Cliffs and enjoyed sun and view of valley below.  The descent from High Cliffs was no joke. It was steep and rocky. We took our time.  Headed southbound was an older fellow being pulled up the trail by a pair of BullDogs.  We stopped and chatted. He has completed several thru hikes of the AT.  He warned us of three large rattlesnakes on the trail after entering PA.  We were cautious, but were only surprised by a Garter snake.  Chuck screamed like a little girl on Xmas day...JK.   We rested our feet on a bench in Pen Mar park.  One of the park workers asked us if we needed anything.  He also provided assistance to hikers. He was very friendly and helpful.  We geared up and walked the .3 miles to the PA/MD border.  There were several other hikers there and we helped each other snap pics of the border crossing.  One of the hikers was thru hiking her trail name was Daubie.  We saw her later in the afternoon too. We also met a fellow thru hikers named Ginger Bear(Big Guy with Ginger hair and beard). His story was similar to many who had restarted hiking after Covid delayed plans.  
   We set up camp at 11.4 miles. Stealth camp with nice level pads and water close by but the only negative it’s next to Rt 16 which is busy and noisy.  I prob won’t hear Pops snore—so maybe a positive after all!  While filtering water I slipped and did a perfect half gainer head first into the creek.  Skinned up my knee and a lil wet but otherwise in good shape.   While setting up to eat at picnic table near parking lot a truck pulled up. Guy asked us if we needed anything (a ride, info, etc.).  He was a PTC trail maintainer but also a Trail Angel. His name was Augie.  So far people are outgoing and positive towards hikers.  Looking forward to meeting new folks.  God Bless.

Well he just stayed right where he was so our fearless leader Chuck takes a step towards him and Giddy Groundhog gets his dander up and the hair raises on the back of his neck and he charges Chuck.  He covers 15’ in a flash! Chuck back peddles into me and I’m trying to get outta the way. Chuck gets a boot up and Giddy runs into his boot and then runs off to our right into the brush.   Which brings me to Pops next saying,”I’ve seen a lot of groundhogs,but I ain’t never seen that!”
    We had about 2 miles to our camp and were out of water.  As we nearing shelter Big Al passed us and told us he was headed to a burger joint 4 miles ahead.  My feet were killing me no way I was making 4 miles.   Well guess what Big Al planted a seed in Pops brain which was just recently over stimulated by a groundhog.  Chuck filtered water and I rested my feet.

We took an early lunch break in a shady spot and continued on walking along the Conodoguinet creek.  The last 1.5 miles was a steep 700’ climb to the Darlington Shelter the privy here is called the Taj Mahal.  It was hot and we stopped to filter water and take in a view which are scarce in Pa.

Highly recommend.  We showered and talked with a section hiker Left Behind.  She told us our hike today would be easy.  It was not!! It was one of the hardest we have had to date.  We hit trail at 0715. Starting out of the gate was a 2 mile road walk that took us across the long Susquehanna River bridge. Both our bodies were not awake or ready for the next 2 miles of serious uphill and boulder climbing.  After 4 miles we were ringing sweat outta headbands and wipe cloths.  Chuck especially.  We drank 2 liters of water in those first 4.2 miles mostly on the uphill.  We stopped at Clarke’s Ferry shelter at 1045 in the nick of time to fill up some of the best spring water we have had on AT.  We hydrated and ate lunch.  We spoke to an active duty navy officer for quite some time then we took nap in the shelter.  We were back on AT at 1315.   The next 7.3 were more rocks and slow.  It took us 10 hrs to complete our 11.5 miles.  We will be staying at the Peters Mountain Shelter.  Currently, Chuck is getting water and I’m talking with a thru hiker named Flying Pig. He’s a young in shape guy who does big mileage 25-30 per day.  The shelter is a nice double decker with a covered porch.   Another hiker strolled into the shelter named Mulligan (a golfer who is on his 2nd attempt at thru hike). Hikers normally talk about how much weight they carry, what type of gear they have, trail conditions, things to be wary of or dangerous situations, and how they got their trail name. The hiking community is diverse yet hikers make fast friends and often lifelong friends.  Hikers call it a Tramily or Trail Family.  Just another reason to hike!! God bless.

Process,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629034,"Hikers up at 0545 and conversation started about who was snoring and who slept well.  Then questions concerning my time spent in NYC and Covid.  Flying Pig and Mulligan on trail at 0700.  We started hike at 0720.  It was a hot and muggy hike.   We saw no thru hikers and only a few day hikers.  We def. had an easier hike today with only one trail leg building uphill. It was a good sweaty workout with 2.4 miles covered in an hour.   We covered 13.4 miles in all.  Trail legs are what hikers call their ability to climb and do distance with minimum stops. I read somewhere it takes about 300 miles to get true trail legs and another 300 miles to develop hiking tendons.  You can see the difference between where we are physically and the thru hikers with 1100 miles under their belts.  They move with ease and a certain flow.  Most of the male hikers with that kind of mileage have lost 25-30 lbs. so they are carrying less body weight too.  We already notice our strengthening in the last 150 miles!  
   We are tented at a place called Yellow Springs.  There are just a few flat areas to set up tents.  No water at this place so we packed in about 2.5 liters of water extra apiece. About an extra 6 pounds. Not fun to carry extra weight.  We talked during the hike about culling down some gear to lighten our load a few pounds. The rule of thumb is..if you haven’t touched a piece of gear in a day or two then you don’t need it.  I weighed my pack in Boiling Spring a few days ago it was  about 35lbs. Not bad but it could be better.  Pops and I are gonna send home my cookstove (Jetboil...I love it) and fuel and just share the weight of his stove(MSR Pocket Rocket...It’s lighter).  I have a few other little items I don’t use too.  They are headed home.  Less weight makes hike more enjoyable...you feel every Oz on these uphills!! Amy and Jana are picking us up at 1300 tomorrow at a road crossing after 9.6 miles.  I think we are going to zero(hiking term for no miles) in Hershey Pa on Tuesday. A well needed rest day.

We quickly covered 3.1 miles and at 4.6 miles filtered water at the stellar Rausch Gap Shelter.  The women folk were meeting us at RT 443 at 1300hrs.  We had good terrain except for one long rocky uphill and rocky descent.   There was a section of AT that was flood by beavers. We took the alternate route. We arrived at pick up point just minutes before the girls drove up with cold Cokes and Orange Fanta.  Showered and bellies full I’m sitting poolside at motel and no signs of Pops...napping is my guess.  We added 9.3miles to our AT mileage total.   Zero day tomorrow.

     We started hiking today at 0838 in very humid conditions. Everything was wet from previous night’s rain it wasn’t long till feet were soaked through.  We had a long uphill with 800’ elevation change that had us soaked from sweat. We downed a liter of H20 in an hour and with only one left and 6 miles to go till we could filter water again we conserved. Pa’s water sources are few and far between. We have to plan accordingly everyday.  
     Trail was good hiking in spots and very rocky in other places that was slow going.  We covered 13.2 miles and are tent camping in a secluded site at 1583’ with spring water close by.  
   About 7 miles into the hike a SOBO (South Bounder) chatted with us and she told us about conditions ahead and there was a guy at a road crossing 3 miles ahead handing out Trail Magic (TM is a person handing out goodies to thru hikers).  We weren’t sure when we would get there...we had to procure water and there was a thunderstorm headed our way so we were headed to hole up in a shelter 1 mile away.  We barely obtained water and got to the shelter.  Sitting on the steps of the William Penn Shelter lighting struck directly in front of us.  We were glad to be in the shelter about ten minutes later two drenched section hikers walked up.  They just graduated from college.  I named them Lightening Rod and Aquarius.  They liked the trail names.  We all rested in the shelter for about 90 minutes. At 1600hrs PopPop and I headed out to do the remaining 4+ miles to our campsite.  We talked about missing TM on three other occasions. There was no way that guy was still at the road crossing. It had been hours since the SOBO told us about him.  We covered the 2.3 miles in 45 minutes just in case.  Low and behold we see a sign that says TM and an arrow pointing to parking lot and there was an angel named TreeTop. He had chairs, Ice ice ice cold Cokes, donuts, apples, bananas, honey buns ( yes Fob honey buns), and oranges.  He hopes to thru hike after retirement.  Thanks TreeTop for the TM it made our evening!!

   I was asked a question concerning last nights entry by a family member who wanted to know what you do when your boots/shoes are wet.   Answer:  If they don’t dry overnight(which is unlikely especially since we had rain).

Potts) about our hike.  They had assisted Fob during his thru hike and now will be assisting us.   
    The plan was for Dave and Deanna to pick us up at the town’s pavilion, but Pops smelled burning cow and we detoured to the Port Clinton Hotel for burgers and fries.  We were soaked from the rain and sat outside on the covered porch. Two patrons Dee and Vicki asked us about our hike and wished us a blessed hike offering prayer on our behalf.  Carly the server took great care of us and just as we finished Dave and Deanna arrived and bought our lunch and took us to the Mircotel.  It looks like heavy rain most of the night so perfect timing on the TM.  Dave and Deanna will be picking us up in a couple of hours to take us to dinner and any shopping we need to do.  We are cleaning up till then.  They are so nice.

   Today was rocky from start to finish. Feet sore after 11.5 miles.  Our first obstacle was called the Knife’s Edge.  It was the hardest boulder scramble to date and challenging. It involved climbing hand over hand with tricky and dangerous moves from one large  rock to another with cliffs on either side.  The weight of the pack makes the scramble harder.  I told Chuck I like a good breakfast scramble but this was ridiculous!!  Pic of Pops is from the top of Knife’s Edge.  After a generally rocky trail with sharp pointed devils we made our way to Oven Bake Knob which was of the same nature as Knife’s Edge.    Then later at an electric line right away we crossed over more huge rocks.   Feet and ankles soon tired of this Process!!  Chuck asked me if my mom hiked in Pa.  Amblin Haz—Hazel hiked most of AT in her late 60s and 70s.  When you actually hike these sections you can appreciate what she actually accomplished.  More about Amblin Haz later...

    So after a great nights rest on comfy beds and sleeping in a bit we had a delicious breakfast at Bert’s Steakhouse.  The diner portion in the front is like a typical 1950’s diner complete with Chuck Berry rock and roll.  We had a good conversation with Tracey the owner and staff.  After breakfast, we had plans to dry out and clean up gear.  While cleaning up gear a resident who lives upstairs,over the hostel,asked Pops and I if we knew anything about plumbing.  Time was about 10:00am.  Little did Doris know that in her midst were the two dumbest plumbers on the planet. Where is Paul Harris (Our Father in Law) at a time like this??  Doris told us her washing machine was leaking by the connections.  We took a look and noticed the hose had a split in it.  I said, “Simple hose change it’ll take 5 minutes.” You can probably see where this is heading...
   Tracey drove Doris to hardware store up the street.  They returned minutes later.  We had limited tools but enough for this “simple Process.”   Chuck and I had initial trouble removing the hot water hose due to some corrosion but applying more hiker muscle it broke free and so did gallons of hot water...mostly on me.   The guts of the valve came out nullifying the shutoff valve.  After finding the main shutoff in the basement we had a mess.  The ladies went back to hardware store after plumbing masters determined an entire new valve was needed.  
    Backstory:  George and Joann Leasure(Chuck’s brother and sister in law) were coming to have lunch with us at Bert’s at 1:00pm.  The time at this point was 11:30.  So much for a five minute job.  There was a lot of fun bantering between us, Tracey (who owns the property) and Doris.  We were still working on plumbing at 1:20 when the waitress from Bert’s came upstairs and told us a guy is in restaurant looking for us.  We dropped project and had lunch having a good visit with George and Joann. Then finished plumbing up later.  Every thing working in perfect order. Doris was happy and thankful for helping her.   We had a great time today.  Tracey bought us all lunch. Thx Tracey!!  Chuck did most of the work as I watched the entertainment.  That’s the Process!       Another hiker named Flat Circle is staying at the hostel tonight.  He was in NYC the same time I was working with Dr w/o borders in a testing center.  He is hiking from NYC To Harper’s Ferry WV.  He has seen five bears and a porcupine so far.  He asked what we have seen.

   Today we did 13.7 miles all of it constant rock.  It was the longest 14 miles.  The morning started with me slowed to a crawl due to the foot pain, but I still avg about 2mph.  Chuck hiked ahead to meet his niece Jamie and her mom at Wind Gap which was about 5 miles into the hike.  I got there 40 minutes after Chuck where Jamie had donuts and a cold coke waiting. Thx Jamie and Terry!!  I took the opportunity to put my feet up and rest which I did a lot over the last few weeks.  Chuck told me at Wind Gap he had fallen and hurt his knee, hand, shoulder, and side.  The Pa rocks are not padded like other state’s rocks :) 
   We climbed out of the gap and on the ridge I told Chuck to hike ahead. It’s hard to hike behind someone going slow.  I stopped often.  I put in earbuds and turned up Lynyrd Skynyrd and just as Sweet Home Alabama cued up with Ronnie saying, “turn it up” a bee stung my right calf.  I did a little dance on the trail swatting my leg and singing Carry me home to see my kin...
    Nasty rocks and bees.  Other state’s bees are pleasant and loving but not in Pa!!   
   While singing They Call me the Breeze I see PopPop headed towards me with hiking sticks and no pack.  He says, “Gimme your pack!”   I resisted but he stood firm and told me he loved me and I relinquished it and he carried it for about a mile over a long sketchy boulder crawl.  This added 2 miles to his mileage and his knee was swollen.  We sat down where he left his pack. I told him as we rested I didn’t think I could continue with my feet in their present condition.  He agreed and thought it best that I rest them for an extended period.  Plantar Fasciitis is a common hiking injury that rest is recommended.  Chuck had a big goose egg on his knee and his hand was swollen too.
