I am hoping for a bunch of you to join us on parts or as much as you can and hike with us. It won't be a fast pace, He will be 75 and I will be 57, and new news about me is sometime the first of 2013, I am to have my right leg amputated just below the knee, so I'll be doing it with a prostetic, less pain than last time, should be ready to hike by then ....

Billygoat changed his start to Feb. 6,2014 so look for him and say hi! He's 75 and has hiked over 50,000 miles ... his is a historic hike! He'll be going slow so with plans to take maybe 7.5 months so everyone should be able to meet him. His knowledge and experience and mindset is amazing, enjoy a moment with a legend. As soon as I can, I'll be hiking again ... enjoy every moment and forget mile counting! Wish I was there ... Crawl",,Happy New Year,"Dec 31, Tue",0

Crawl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612797,"I am back ... final ... the last 6 years,  I have been caring for my mother with severe dementia,  Feb 19,2019 she final got her angel wings! She was 91, long life, well lived! So my 6 years of sitting is over, weight loss is going great, 70lbs gone so far, been in the gym now 2 months, doing couch to 10k running app to run the Peachtree Road Race 10k July 4th  ... leaving July 9th for Denver to do some altitude hiking to get use to high altitudes with the famed Billygoat! Then we are headed to the PCT to hike about 370 miles from Forester Pass to Donner Pass. Everything goes well, March 3rd, 2020, my new wife, Amy, and I will be at Springer starting our thru hike. It will not be as most on here, I have a right lower leg amputation, surgery was Feb.2014 ... so I will be, if I thru hike, the first American,  the first male, to thru hike the Appalachian Trail in a 12 month period ... if my research is correct. There was a female, German, Niki Rellon thru hike it a couple of years ago ... plus I will be 63 in December! Well, I am training hard this time, Billygoat will be a huge amount of information for me, he's hiked over 51k miles, he's 80! Hope to see you out there, 2020 will be an Epic year ....My thru will probably be a leapfrog hike, leap to Massachusetts and finish the end, then back to where I leaped from.  Also, trail name is Crawl but suggestions are pointing to ""IHOP""  ... lol",,View Entry,"May 07, Tue",0
