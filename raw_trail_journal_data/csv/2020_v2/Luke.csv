Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629301,"This will be the 4th year of my AT hike. I’m not a thru hiker or a section hiker, I am a Lasher, a long ass section hiker. I have hiked 500-600 each of the last three year and will be completing the AT this year. Last year, I finished 53 miles short of Vermont, so that will be this years starting point.  SAS my hiking buddy will be joining me the same as the last three years.

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629302,"Met SAS, Slow and Steady at the car rental in Albany NY after my marathon drive from Colorado. He had driven from NC. Had to drop off the Budget rental at the Albany airport and pick up a Hertz to get to Pittsfield Mass, the closest town to where we finished our hike last year. Stayed overnight at the Hilton Garden Inn and had dinner at a great Italian restaurant down the street. Tomorrow we hit the trail.",,View Entry,"Jul 11, Sat",0
Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629300,"Our shuttle driver Debbie drooped us off at the trail head at 10:00am. Late start as I had slept in, much needed after the long drive from Colorado. Always feels a bit surreal returning to your end point from the previous year. Beautiful day, in the mid sixties. A 900 foot climb right out of the gate. After that, a relatively flat trail the rest of the day. As easy as it gets on the AT. Came across three thru hikers by the time we made our camping spot at 3:00pm. Short first day to get back in the flow. Four more hikers, three section and one thru hiker eventually joined us. Around 5:00 a twenty something male hiker came by. A thru hiker, just 52 days out from Springer. Most people take 4 months to get to this point. After a few minutes he was off for ten more miles to wrap up his 37 mile day. Set up camp, ate dinner which consisted of cold chicken salad from a foil wrap, dehydrated corn and potatoes which had been cold soaking since earlier in the day. I stopped cooking last year to save weight from carrying a cook set. Once you get used to it, it’s not bad. Hit the hammock around 7:00 pm to catch up on the lack of sleep from the last three days.","Mass Turnpike

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629310,"About 2:00am the rain started coming down last night. I put my ear plugs in, rolled over and slept like a baby until 5:15 when SAS decided to make a racket. The rain had stopped, so I quickly tore down camp before it started again. Forecast called for rain most of the day. As luck turned out, it only rained for about an hour, and because the tree canopy was so heavy we stayed fairly dry. Another easy day, but we stepped up our mileage to 11.6 miles, finishing in Dalton Mass where the trail goes right through town. Stopped at Tom Levardi’s house. Tom has been opening his house and property to hikers for forty years. He was just finishing the final touches on a mohawk haircut on a hiker on his front porch. Tom is known for his mohawks and it has come to be a right of passage for many hikers. I passed, as only a reverse mohawk would work on me. Unfortunately, Tom does not have any trees to hang a hammock, and since we were exhausted, we headed to a hotel. Mass is allowing camping in very few places so we had limited options.","October Mountain Shelter

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629343,"Got a ride from Tom back to his house in Dalton, and was back on the trail by 9:00. Not an early start, but had a short day today. The trail goes for about a mile and a half through the town. Great small country town with beautiful homes, everyone waving and very trail friendly. After town, a 4 mile, 1000 foot climb. It was fairly easy except for the heat. Today and tomorrow are supposed to be the hottest days of the year. After the climb, we descended a few miles and stopped for lunch at the Cheshire Cobbles (see picture). Beautiful spot. We hung out for about an hour, eating our lunch and enjoying the view. Afterwards a quick mile downhill into Cheshire, another quintessential small   Massachusetts town. We arrived around 2:00. The town recently opened a AT hiker camp ground, equipped with water, bathroom(port a potty) picnic bench, bear box, and soon to be electric outlets and bikes to ride through town. This is heaven for hikers. Right across the street, Diane’s Twist, a sandwich and ice cream shop. The large chocolate milk shake never tasted so good. Next, off to the dollar store to resupply. It was now in the upper eighties and the mile and half round trip seemed more difficult than today’s hike. Back to the camp ground and time to order pizza delivery. Great dinner with another hiker we have been yo-yo-ing back and forth. He is from NY and is hiking to  Mount Washington, about three hundred miles away. Now, I’m in my hammock, writing this and hoping for a star filled sky tonight. Tomorrow, Mt. Greylock, the first big climb in the NE, and biggest climb since the Priest in Virginia.","Dalton, Mass

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629396,"Woke up at 4:59am, one minute before the alarm was set to go off. Funny how that always happens. Out of camp at 5:40. The plan was an early start for the Mt. Graylock asssult, as it was going to be another hot one. It’s an 8.6 mile, 3,000 ft climb. A half mile walk out of town, then the first 1,100 feet. Nothing too difficult, but fairly steep. The next few miles it was a steady, but low grade climb. Then another 1,300 ft steep climb.  A third of the way up we stopped at a shelter for a break. It was around 8:30, and four weekend hikers were packing up to leave. After a half hour, we continued up the rest of the 1,300 ft climb. Upon reaching the top of that section, the grade backed off considerably. Then the final 1 mile and very steep. People were starting to appear as they had hiked down from the top which is accessible by car. Finally, came out of the trees with the monument right in front of us. SAS showed up about a half hour later. In the end it took 5 hours to get to the top. That included two long breaks. This first big climb in the NE was challenging, but not overly difficult. However, it is only a precursor to what is ahead of us. After a little sightseeing, we made a beeline to the snack bar. A sirloin burger and a beer hit the spot. We hung out for another hour and then started the descent down the other side. Very steep and slow going. We went to the next shelter, 3.4 miles away for the night.","Cheshire Mass

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629397,"The skies were clear last night as I set up camp, so I opted not to put up my tarp. At 3:30 the skies opened up. I quickly jumped out of the hammock and in a few minutes had the tarp up, but not before everything was wet, including me. Fortunately, it wasn’t cold. I wiggled back into my quilt (like sleeping bag that opens up and you lay it over the top of you). I was wet, it was wet, everything was wet. It took about an hour to fall back asleep. I woke up around 6:15 and everything had dried out. Out of camp at 7:00 for a steep 3 mile downhill into North Adams. The trail cuts through the outer edge of town. Half a mile off the trail was a grocery store. A quick small resupply which included picking up a sandwich from the deli. SAS and I found a picnic bench outside to eat. Soon 5 thru hikers came along and a few of them joined us. Most had started in late Feb. and early March. After lunch, a 1,700 ft climb with full bellies and upper eighty temperatures awaited us. The first 1,000 ft. were tough, mainly due to the heat. We reached a spring with very cold water. It was refreshing. After drinking a liter of water, known as cameling up in trail lingo and soaking my shirt in the cold water we took off. The rest of the climb wasn’t quite as grueling. The temperature dropped a bit as we gained altitude and it clouded up some. At the crest of the climb, we reached the Vermont border which is also the start of the Long Trail. A trail that runs from the southern Vermont border to Canada. It shares a little over one hundred miles with the AT. Eleven states down, three to go. Made  camp around 5. Set up my hammock and went to find the water supply. The creek was nothing more than a trickle. It took over ten minutes to fill up my water bottles. Tomorrow we will hike to Bennington Vt. to pick up a resupply box, have some hot food (I eat only cold food on the trail) and stay in town for the night. Now,  I’m looking at the stars from my hammock as I chose not to put up my tarp again. Certainly, it won’t rain tonight?","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629398,"No rain last night, so I stayed dry unlike the previous night. 12 people camping at the shelter last night. By far the most people we’ve seen so far. Out of camp at 6:45. We’re trying to get early starts to get some miles in before it gets hot. Nothing special today, no monuments, no state crossings, no rain. Just an ordinary day, churning out the miles. Went by a few beaver ponds and got off trail at one point, but quick realized it before going to far. Steep, rocky downhill at the end of the day. Got to the road crossing around 3:00 and headed into Bennington to resupply and sleep in a real bed. Stopped for a beer at an outdoor pub and then went to the Avocado Pit, a burrito joint. We’re staying at the Catamount hotel. Some of the people from camp last night are here as well.","Seth Warner Shelter

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629454,"Slept in until 8:00am. On the way to breakfast, I dropped of my bounce box at the post office,  then had two great bagels at the bagel shop. After breakfast, off to the dollar store to resupply. Went back to the hotel to pack up. It can be quite a ritual to get all your food together. The next stretch will take about 4 days. Your backpack is always heaver when you leave town. We we’re planning to nero today, which is hiker talk for a short day. The plan wad to eat lunch and then get a ride back to the trail at 1:00. First part of the plan went well with lunch at a pizza place, gorging myself on a calzone. On the way back to the hotel, we stopped by the burrito place we ate at the night before and got a burrito to pack out for dinner. The second part of the plan did not go as well. The hotel owner was our ride back to the trail. He didn’t show up until 2:45, almost two hours late. Got back to the trail head at 3:00 and found there was trail magic. A couple who were thru hiking had to leave the trail due to an injury. They were stopping at road crossings providing trail magic with their unused resupply boxes. We picked up a few things and headed up the trail. Anytime you come out of town or cross a road, you can expect a climb. This time was no different. A steep, rocky 900 ft climb. We ended up only going 3.5 miles before stopping to camp right next to a creek. Right now I’m listening to water flow down the rocks and the ominous thunder in the distance coming our way.","Bennington Vt

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629482,"The storm hit around 8:00pm. Thunder and lightning right above us and a downpour. The nice quiet stream I was sleeping next to became a raging river. The fast moving water roared all night long. Even with earplugs, you could hear it’s ferocity. The rain was off and on all night. I stayed dry and actually got a fair amount of sleep. The rain had stopped by the time I woke up. I quickly tore down camp as it was supposed to rain off and on through out the day. Left camp at 7:00. At 8:30 it started to come down again, hard. I quickly put my raincoat on and my pack cover on my backpack and trudged on. It rained hard for about twenty minutes. I made it to the next shelter about 45 minutes later, wet and cold, but shortly before the next deluge started. SAS was not as fortunate. He dragged in about 15 minutes later totally drenched. We spent about an hour at the shelter eating lunch and trying to dry off. The rain had stopped, so we set off for another 5 miles to the next shelter. Fortunately, it did not rain anymore. On the plus side, it was much cooler today. Now, I’m in my hammock, hoping for no rain tonight as there is about a forty percent chance. Tomorrow, the forecast calls for sunny skies. I’m keeping my fingers crossed.","Hell Hollow Brook

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629483,"Yes, it rained again last night. Just for a couple of hours, but not near as hard as the previous night. I stayed dry as my tarp above my hammock did it’s job. There were two young men at the shelter last night. They were both living in Boston, but one was from Denver originally. He grew up in the same area of town as I had, albeit many years later. Today was going to be our longest day so far, 15 miles. The highlight of the day was a two thousand foot climb over Stratton mountain, home to Stratton Ski area. The climb was difficult but very pretty. Upon reaching the summit there is a care taker hut and a fire tower. Without the tower there would have been no views as the top is covered in pines. The views from the tower were awesome (see pic). After spending some time at the top, I headed down the three mile descent to camp. Arrived around 5:30 to camp with multiple blisters. I usually don’t get blisters, but my shoe had ripped along the side and I think it allowed my foot to move around and rub, causing the blisters. It also didn’t help that my feet haven’t been dry in two days. On the plus side, I’m staying next to Stratton Pond. When I arrived in camp, I made a beeline to the pond for a dip. It felt great after three days on the trail without a shower. It felt good doing fifteen miles today and I’m sure I will sleep well tonight.","Kid Gore Shelter

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629520,"Had a great nights sleep. Beautiful weather overnight and no need for the rain tarp. Packed up and walked by Stratton pond. Looks like a lake to me, as it very large. But in maintaining  the quaintness that is Vermont, I will respect it’s name. Two Lunes were attempting flight. Apparently, their feather quills are not hollow making flight more difficult. They eventually rose from the water and headed upward. These were the first of hopefully many more Lunes I’ll see. It was a fairly easy 10 miles into Manchester Center where I will be spending the night and taking a zero tomorrow for rest and to give my blisters a chance to heal. Three miles from town we stopped at a great overlook with a view of town and the surrounding mountains. When I got to the road, two college girls that were at the shelter the previous night, were waiting for one of there fathers to pick them up as they had completed their one hundred mile hike. Dad brought pizza for the girls and offered me a slice. It was wonderful. The trail provides!

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629562,"Slept in a bit before going for breakfast. I wasn’t sure what time my package with my new/old shoes was going to arrive. They are well used with a small hole above the toe. It was my only option, as the new pair I ordered are not going to arrive for another 10 days. Thanks to my beautiful wife for shipping them. She’s holding down the homestead back in Colorado. with Annie our 18 month old Pyrenees/Aussie mix and new addition, 3 year old German Shepherd, Ranger. Shoes arrived around 10, so off to the Post Office and then lunch at a Mexican restaurant. Picked up a burrito at a burrito joint down the street to pack out for dinner. I like Mexican food! Didn’t get back to the trail until 2:30, when all was said and done. It was in the upper eighties and I had a 1,400 ft climb to the top of Mt Bromley, which is the top of the ski area. Once back in the trees, and the shade they provided, it wasn’t too bad. 
At the top of Mt Bromley, there is a Ski Patrol hut they keep open for hikers to spend the night. But, since I hammock  and do not have a sleeping pad, I was not about to sleep on the hard floor. I tried to hang my hammock on the chair lift platform, but couldn’t make it work. Would have been a nice place to see the sunset and sunrise. Hiked down the back side of the mountain, to a dirt road that had a water cache. Thanks to The Green Mountain hiking club for providing the water as this is a ten mile dry stretch. I decided to hang my hammock right there, as it was 6:30 and a good place to stop. Blisters did not give me to much trouble today. I had them tapped up and it worked well. Rain expected tomorrow, which is not good for blisters. I’m keeping my toes crossed!","Manchester Center, Vt

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629636,"Woke up early to try and hike the 5 miles to the next shelter before the rain hit.  I did not make it. In thirty minutes, the skies opened up. Thunder and lightning crashing above and it rained. Did I mention it rained. For what seemed like hours, it came down. The trail was a river and I was soaked. There’s not a rain jacket made that will keep you dry when you’re out in the rain that long. By the time I made the shelter, the damage was done. It had finally stopped raining. The shelter was packed with other soaked hikers and those smart enough who had spent the night there waiting the rain out. Even though space was tight, everyone was welcoming and made room for us not so fortunate ones. After about and hour, the sun was trying to peak its head out, so off I went. My feet and blisters had done fairly well given the conditions. I hiked another 9 miles trying to avoid mud, wet roots and rocks. Stopped for the night at Little Rock Pond. Arrived too late to take a dip in the pond. Set up camp and ate dinner with a group of LT ( Vermont Long Trail) and AT thru hikers and Lashers (long ass section hiker). I am a member of the latter group. No rain in the forecast tonight. Maybe I’ll get that swim in the morning.","Mad Tom Notch Rd Stealth Camp Site

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629637,"Left camp around 7, no one was in a hurry. It became clear a few miles in, SAS’s knee was not going to hold up to the rigors of the trail. Unfortunately, he made the decision to quit. It was the right decision, no sense causing more damage. He made s few calls to arrange a ride into town and to start the trip home. I’ll miss you hiking buddy. Hope your knee gets better. After leaving SAS, I had one of the toughest climbs so far. It was only a 1,000 feet, but it was hot. I slowly made my way up finally reaching the top and taking a long break. Relief was only a few miles away at Clarendon Gorge, which is known for a great swimming hole. As soon as I got there, off the clothes went and in I went. I did leave my gym shorts on! Spent about thirty minutes there, but had to leave as it was getting late and there was a brutal 700 foot rock scramble ahead. The cool down in the river made it manageable. Plus, I knew what awaited me at the next shelter, Beer!. Andrew, the care taker regularly stocks a cooler with beer. I arrived at the shelter around 6 and much to my disappointment there was no beer. There was eight of us at the shelter, a group of hikers that I have been hiking around. Tree Boy, Woodsman, Tusk, Grugel, and Sweetness to name a few. Yes, hikers are wierd. We had a roaring fire going, and lo and behold, the caretaker Andrew drove up on his four wheeler loaded with beer. After a few beers, the fire got larger and the stories louder. Fortunately, hikers are too tired to stay up late, and by 10 it was off to bed. I’m sure everyone slept a little better.","Little Rock Pond

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629654,"Today was just going to be a tuff day. I was going to attempt my highest mileage day and on top of that it would be the greatest elevation gain. Off I went early. The first 6 miles were nothing special. But then the assent up Mt. Killington began. 5 miles and 3,000 feet up. It was hot, but not stiffling. It cooled as I gained elevation. Half a mile from the top it began to rain lightly. I began to run as I could see a heavy band of rain not far away. If I was lucky, I could get to the shelter, before the hard stuff began to come down. I didn’t make it. The skies opened up just a few minutes from the shelter. Of course I was drenched, but it was nice to go inside out of the rain. After thirty minutes, the rain let up. I hiked the final five miles with Woodsman, a fifty year old school teacher from Mass. He is hiking The Long Trail, which shares the AT for about a hundred miles before verring off in a different direction. The Long Trail was the first long distance trail in the country. It runs the length of Vermont, north to south. I’m staying at The Long Trail Inn tonight, which coincidentally is right next to the trail. I will resupply in Killington tomorrow. No air conditioning at the hotel tonight, just like the trail.","Clarendon Shelter
