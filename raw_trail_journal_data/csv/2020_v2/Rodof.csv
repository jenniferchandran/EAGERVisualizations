Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626382,"Well, the midnight train to Georgia was a relatively uneventful ride. Did not get much sleep, because I think I was in the party car. Conversations went on all night long. 
Ron Brown - a legendary shuttle driver in these parts- picked me up in Gainesville. This was my third experience driving with Ron. He was proud to show me his new 2019 Toyota Forerunner, which he has owned for all of eight months. He has already logged 110 K miles on this automobile! Ron brought me to Barefoot Hills, which is a very nice lodge/hostel in Dahloniga, Georgia. 
I spent the day in Barefoot Hills chilling out and attending to last minute details for my hike. I hitched into town and had a nice “Linner” (lunch/dinner) at the Bourbon Street Grille. Psyched to get started!","Baltimore

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626428,"Day One is done. As expected, we had- and continue to have- pretty steady rain, along with declining temperatures. As I write this, it is a 6:30PM, and everyone here at the shelter is down for the count. Darkness is falling, and rain, maybe with a tiny bit of sleet, pitter patters the tin roof of the shelter . I am snuggled up in my bag, comfortable. 
Amicalola was amazing. The falls are beautiful; the climb is a pretty intense way to start the hike. Almost nine miles, in one summits Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of the AT- my official starting point as a Northbound hiker. So now I am about 3 miles in, even though I hiked almost 12 miles. 
It was impossible to stay dry today, but I have to say my hiking umbrella helped a lot. Hopefully tomorrow will be dry, if not sunny. Unfortunately there is no cell signal here at the shelter so I am unable to check the weather. I was also unable to pick up a satellite signal from inside the shelter, and am not inclined to go out in the rain to try for an unobstructed view of the sky. 
Until tomorrow!","Amicalola Falls

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626452,"Today began with a beautiful sunny morning, which steadily deteriorated from lunchtime onward. The afternoon brought strong breezes and light drizzle. Also, a gorgeous view on Cedar Mountain. 
However, my progress was not fast enough for me to safely make it over Blood Mountain and make it to Neels Gap today. It is another 3.6 miles, and the descent is rocky with twilight approaching. So I decided to call it a day at 12 miles, and stay at the Woods Hole Shelter. 
Good call. Shortly after I arrived at the shelter, the strong breeze turned into strong winds, temps dropped quickly, and snow started to fly. The shelter was full, so I needed to pitch my tent for the night in the wind. It is a shame this activity was not caught on video. So here I am now (7PM), bundled up, fully clothed and them some, in my bag listening to the wind outside. Hopefully my tired legs will help me quickly get to sleep!","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626480,"Well, last night turned out to be the toughest night I have ever had in the woods. Temperatures dropped into the low 20s, with sustained winds of 20mph, with gusts of 40mph. The storm was noisy too. I have never heard wind howl like that. The gusts were quite powerful; you could hear them coming and they would make a loud slapping sound when the bursts hit my tent. The good news is that my tent held up very well to the conditions. The bad news is I did not get much sleep. Given the beating my tent was taking, I had to get up and check the stakes, guy lines, etc. Also, the strength of the gusts was forcing snow (tiny ice crystals, actually) under the rain fly and into/ through the mesh of my inner tent. This caused a burst of fine moisture into the tent when these gusts occurred - not good. So not great sleeping conditions. Fortunately I packed a water resistant bivy sack for my sleeping bag. Bivys are usually used outside, for when one may want to sleep under a tarp or under the stars. I included one on my gear list as another means to keep warm. In this case, I received both the insulation the bivy provided, and (most importantly) it kept my sleeping bag dry. The morning breakdown was another circus as I had to disassemble and pack in these unceasing winds. This took some time, as one might imagine. Fingers cold, too!!! 
Eventually, I was on my way and traversed Blood Mountain to land in Neel’s Gap. Although this was <4 miles, the hike was very difficult due to icy, rocky conditions. The descent was especially challenging. 
There is an outfitter store at Neel’s Gap, a few hostels, and a few restaurants down the road. So, it was an easy decision to stop here and recoup. I am in a nice 2 BR cabin with another thru hiker - John. He is a retired fire/rescue worker from Winchester, VA. We met this AM, on the way into Neels Gap. We learned about the cabin hostel at the outfitter store, and quickly decided to go in together. (All of the cabins are 2BR.) As the afternoon progressed, I observed that several hikers hung out here at the hostel, looking for roomies for the night in order to cost share. I find this an interesting facet of hiker culture. 
Happy to be sleeping in a cabin tonight!","Woods Hole Shelter
",Neel’s Gap,Sent from my iPhon,Day 4
Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626498,"Following a most pleasant night at the Blood Mountain cabins (the Fox Cabin, specifically), I stopped at the outfitters at Neel’s Gap. They are famous for conducting equipment shakedowns, and or a rich source of advice for hikers. I found their reputation to be well deserved. After about an hour with Matt, we shaved 4 pounds off my pack weight. I also bought a new backpack, which is the same model as the one I currently have (ULA Catalyst), only one size larger. I did not realize what I was missing. The fit of the larger pack is clearly better for me. Matt provided with me numerous tips as well; I felt like I had a private coaching lesson. 
The hike today was beautiful. Light snow fell almost all day long, with mild breezes. The mountains were quiet, with only the sound of the snowflakes landing all around you. Very peaceful. 
I arrived at Low Gap at about 5:15 PM, to find a very full campground and shelter. The shelter itself is packed, and there are at least a dozen tents scattered about. I am surprised by the number of people on the trail at this time of year. The folks at the ATC commented about this when I registered. They said that the typical pattern has moved forward by about three weeks this year. My guess is that this is driven by the relatively mild winter we are having. 
That’s it for now! it is 8 PM, past my bedtime! ?","Neel’s Gap
",Low Gap,Sent from my iPhon,Nice Day to Hike!
Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626519,"I woke up in the morning to find 2 to 3 inches of snow outside, With temperatures in the low 20s. Fortunately there were no winds down here in the gap. But one could hear the wind howling at the top of the mountain. I was unable to find a very good tenting site last night, given how crowded it was. As a result, I was sleeping on a slope and was unable to stay on my pad through the night. So it was not a restful night. The only way to correct this problem for sure is to get to my destination earlier in the day. I will have to see how the crowds hold up, and think about shifting my hiking hours. 
I was up and out of camp relatively quickly, because it was finger numbing cold. I mean this literally, as there is no way to break down your site with gloves on. I ate breakfast (peanut butter crackers, cheese) while hiking, deciding against making coffee this morning. I just had to get moving. 
After I hiked out of the gap, I found those howling winds. Most of the morning was ridge walking, with only minor elevation changes. But the trail was quite hazardous, given the snow, ice and wind. Conditions on the mountain can change very quickly. When on the windward side of a mountain, the conditions can be quite harsh, but when you wind around to the leeward side, it can immediately feel like spring time. This transition can occur in a matter of minutes. 
Based on conversations with other hikers, I considered going only to Unicoi Gap today, and head into the town of Helen, GA. This was not my original plan, but Helen is a nice little town with German heritage. The thought of some German food was appealing. John, who I stayed with at Neel’s Gap, had decided he was going to do this because he needed to dry out his gear following the snow last night. So as we descended into Unicoi Gap, I made the decision to join John and go to Helen We hitched into town and got a room together. 
A quick word regarding hitchhiking. While I am not at all a fan of this activity at home, it is commonplace in hiker towns. Uber and Lyft are not always readily available. I hitched to lunch in Dahlonega, dinner in Neel’s Gap, and of course from Unicoi Gap to Helen as well. I did not even need to hitch back home from dinner at Neel’s Gap because the owner of the restaurant offered me a lift back to the cabins that evening. Each time so far, the people who picked me up have been extremely friendly and helpful. They want to hear your story, and want to tell their story. This is a different world. 
Helen was wonderful. It is a cute little town, dotted with half timbered structures, as you would see in Germany. It is definitely a tourist spot, with the Chattahoochee River running through. Sort of a mini Gatlinburg, with much better restaurants. After restocking food and supplies from the Dollar General, I poked around and found a microbrewery. What was interesting about this place, was not it’s beer, but it’s menu. The family who runs this place is from Alaska, and they are sending fish and crab in from Alaska to this restaurant. The menu is chock full of halibut, salmon, scallop and black bass dishes, and King crab legs. After checking this out, I looked a little further and found a very nice German restaurant, owned and operated by a German family. The menu looked outstanding. What a torturous decision I had to make. In the end, I decided for king crab legs at the microbrewery. I seriously considered staying in Helen another night so I could go to the German restaurant! But, it is a beautiful day and my desire to hike on has won out!","Low Gap Shelter
",Unicoi Gap,Sent from my iPhon,Helen!
Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626530,"Today was essentially a half day. Following a robust breakfast at Cimmy’s, I left Helen in the late AM. The hike to Tray Mountain Shelter was really two successive climbs. The first was a 1,000 ft elevation gain over 1.4 miles, and the second was a 1300 ft elevation gain over 2.6 miles. So here I sit, 4200 ft up, ready for an early bedtime. 
There are not as many shelters/campsites at high elevations as there are in the gaps. I much prefer the sites in the gaps because it is usually a lot less windy. I have learned through my first week of winter hiking that wind can really suck the heat right out of you. All to say that I am bracing for another chilly night, more because of the wind than the actual temperature. 
All in all, a very pleasant day hiking!","Unicoi Gap

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626573,"Today was a chilly, rainy day overall, with temperatures below 40 degrees all day. It is cooling quickly as I compose this entry. My new accessory for this trip - a hiking umbrella-served me very well. It is very effective at keeping me dry. It is a bit cumbersome to manage with hiking sticks. I’ve found I can rig the umbrella to my backpack and go hands-free. But it does require a fair amount of attention. I would still say that overall, this was an excellent addition to my equipment set. 
Amazingly, I am the only occupant at Plumorchard shelter. I noted that at Deep Gap Shelter about 8 miles back, there were already 6 hikers unpacking for the day- and I passed by at 11:30! Also, there is a bailout point about 5 miles back at Dick’s Gap. Many hikers used this opportunity to head into Hiawassee to resupply and possibly take a zero day tomorrow, with more rain in the forecast. Net, I am here at Plumorchard all alone. Peaceful, but also a little unsettling at the same time. I am counting on the steady rainfall tonight to keep visitors to a minimum!","Tray Mountain Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626622,"Following a very restful night, I was on the trail by 8AM. After climbing Standing Indian Mountain, miles of ridge running lay ahead. Gentle rolling ascents and descents, with many views of the NC mountains to the east and west. Only a mild breeze. Nice. The only thing that could have improved the experience would have been some sunshine. But really, a nice section of hiking. After about 12 miles of this, Albert Mountain presented itself. Albert’s final ascent is short, at just over a quarter mile, but carries an elevation gain of 400 ft. Think about that for a second. You can stand up straight, put out your arms, and almost touch the trail in from of you. In other words, time to put the poles away and start rock climbing. Fortunately the ascent was technically simple; it was definitely a workout! 
Landed in Long Reach Shelter about 5:30 and decided to sleep in the shelter tonight since rain is forecasted. Many familiar faces from the trail are here, and someone started a fire. Sweet! 
Tomorrow I am looking at about 7 miles to get to Winding Stair Gap, and then a shuttle into Franklin. Resupply, laundry, some comfort food awaits!!","Standing Indian Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626647,"I was up early and off to a 7AM start this morning. The trail from Long Branch Shelter to Winding Stairs Gap was very benign. As a result, I reached Winding Stairs Gap about 10:30AM. Along the way at Rock Gap, I met Zen, the proprietor of Gooder Grove Hostel. Zen introduced himself as an “AT Concierge”, who would provide a multitude of services (shuttle to/from the trail and around town, laundry, local advice, etc.). I was impressed with how personable he was, so I decided on the spot that I would stay at his hostel in Franklin. 
Zen’s hostel It’s quite nice. It is a house in the woods just south of town, but still within walking distance. It can accommodate up to 20 hikers, there is a fairly constant stream of activity around the place. Zen has three rules for his hostel. Be Kind, Be Kind of Clean, and (just) Be. The last rule is intended to address mutual respect. Folks gather in the family room, to chat and share stories. It is a nice atmosphere. 
I had a the biggest gyro I have ever seen for lunch shortly after I arrived. Yum! I then spent my afternoon taking inventory for resupply, cleaning up, and checking out Franklin. Dinner was a nice plate of wings at the Root and Barrel Restaurant. I am liking Franklin!","Long Branch Shelter

Breakfast, a barbershop shave, resupplying at the Dollar General (Knorr Spanish Rice, anyone?), fuel at the outfitter in town, and a few other sundries. By mid-day I was back at the hostel catching up on email, catching up with Holly, and posting pictures to this journal. I watched a bit of the news and quickly realized what a treat it has been to be mostly disconnected. I had a burger for dinner at one of the local pubs, and joined a group in the family room on my return for some movie watching and trail story sharing. As you might expect, there are many familiar hikers here. We are starting to get to know one another, and the camaraderie is nice.","Franklin, NC

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626744,"I had a big hiking day today, making my largest mileage to date. These were difficult miles as well. Trail conditions were dicey in numerous spots. But the prize was to arrive at the NOC, where a cheeseburger and a beer awaited! 
Given the condition of my feet, I decided to take a night in the hostel at the NOC. I am nursing several blisters across both feet, toes and heels. I plan to stay in the hostel again for the next two nights, so this feels like a splurge of sorts. But, I told myself at the beginning of the hike, “When hostels are readily available take them!” Given I will be spending between 150 and 175 nights out here, just doesn’t seem like a bad operating principle. OK, enough of my rationalization. 
Now, about my feet. Historically, I have had very little problem with blistering when hiking. I am wearing the same make and model boots where I always have. So why am I having issues now? I can only conclude at this point it has to do with the chronic beating that my feet are taking over time. I have now been hiking almost continuously for 14 days. In the past, my trips rarely exceeded seven days. I am hopeful that the situation will improve as my feet adjust to my new norm. 
Tomorrow is another big day, starting with a death march hike virtually all uphill for 7 miles, with a total elevation gain of 3500 feet. Yikes.","Wayah Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626767,"Today was another good hiking day. With beautiful weather, sunny and in the 50’s, it felt like an early spring day. The trail out of the NOC was, as expected, an unrelenting ascent. But the grade was not severe and the condition of the trail was very good for much of the ascent. 
Once up top, it got more rugged. In fact, I fell after tripping on a stealth tree root. Fortunately, no injuries (except to my pride) resulted. What did happen was that my 1.5 liter water bag fell out of my pack -it is in a side pocket- unbeknownst to me. I only realized I lost it when I took a break to refill my drinking bottle about a mile down the trail. I thought this would be manageable with a water source identified a few miles down the trail. Unfortunately, the spring was dry. So, I hiked the last six miles with about 8 ounces of water to parse out. Fortunately this was manageable, as I hydrated well at lunch. But I will not kid you, I was thirsty when I got to Stecoah Gap! 
I had planned from the start of my hike to stay at Wolf Creek Hostel, owned and operated by Lonnie McCracken. I have stayed here before on two occasions, and have always enjoyed great service from Lonnie. Tonight was no exception. Lonnie was waiting for me when I arrived at Stecoah Gap, and he had my resupply box (which Holly mailed earlier) with him. He took another hiker (Ladybird) and I to Bryson City for resupply. I was keen to soak my feet, and was going to purchase Epsom salts, but Lonnie already had this covered at the hostel! Unfortunately, the local restaurant is closed today, so I purchased a rotisserie chicken, a box of Zatarain’s rice, and a pint of Cherry Garcia for dinner- and maybe lunch tomorrow. Yum. 
I am taking a zero day tomorrow to nurse my feet. Following that, I have a one day hike to Fontana Dam, then on to the Smoky Mountains. Exciting!","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626800,"My so called Zero Day is in the books. That’s two Zeros in my first 16 days. This is in the range of what I was planning -about one of every 8-10 days. I am encouraged! 
My day was uneventful but enjoyable. I soaked my feet in Himalayan Salts (Thank you, Lonnie!) organized my food and supplies for the days ahead, did laundry, email and made a few phone calls. Low key and sweet. 
My adrenaline is high, as I anticipate the Smoky Mountains. As I mentioned before, I am one day away from the park. The Smoky Mountains are classified as a rain forest. Lots of fog and mist, hence the name. It is a very diverse ecosystem, with the largest “old growth” forests in the Eastern US. It is also a World Heritage site, a UNESCO designated Biosphere Preserve, and is the most visited National Park in the US. All to say it is a pretty special place. I would be negligent if I did not also add that I am a little nervous about the upcoming week of hiking. The climate in the Smokies can change quite rapidly, and even on the good days it will be very wet, especially so at this time of year. (“Wet” and “blistered feet” are a bad combination!) Also, it is not uncommon to encounter blizzard conditions in the Smokies this time of year. So far, the forecast looks very good, temperature-wise, so I am optimistic!

It lay spread out below, across the various valleys, with the sun shining on it. Very peaceful. 
My hike ended at the Fontana Dam Shelter, also known as the Fontana Hilton. The title is well deserved. Amenities include running potable water, working toilets, sinks with running water, and get this- a solar charging station for phones! The facility also includes showers (2), which did not look appealing. The shelter is spacious and clean. A large patio area with fire pit adjoins the shelter.

Actually, I am thrilled we are not looking at snow and ice. The hike to Double Spring Gap was aggressive, given the conditions. Most trails were muddy, making for uncertain footing. I should embellish a bit here. Frequently, the muddy trail was covered with leaves. So when you plant your foot, the ground slipped underneath you. At best, you spent a lot of energy getting traction. At worst, your leg whooshed out as you planted your foot and next thing you know, you are sitting in the muck. So it was a long day. My feet are quite tired from the physical demands the trail put on them. 
I arrived at Double Springs at 7PM. Shelter is packed, but it looks like 12 of us will fit in! Looks like all 12 are thru hikers and know what they are doing. Sleep is looking good.

Although it was cloudy, the clouds were high and it was a dry, clear day. Three miles in I summited Clingmans Dome and was treated to fabulous views. Spectacular and humbling, they were. On the way down, I hiked through several large (several mile) hemlock groves. These are unique in that the forest under the hemlocks is other-worldly. A little dark, misty, and filled with moss growth. Very beautiful, and unlike anything I have seen anywhere else. And the sound that the winds make with Hemlocks is unique. The trees really whisper, making the wind sound calming. Honestly, I did not want this to end. 
I had decided that I would bail from the trail at Newfound Gap for resupply at Gatlinburg. Gatlinburg is at least 10 miles away, but Highway 441, which cuts through the National Park, is well travelled. I had no problem catching a ride (<5 min) into town.

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627174,"Slept in a bit this morning, awakening at 8:30. I did not have a restful night, so the extra time helped. Given the shelter mileages ahead, I could hike 3 or 10 miles. I couldn’t commit myself to more mileage than that, since I had to account for time to get to the trailhead from Gatlinburg. That said, I was not in a rush and took time to make a few calls and eat a full breakfast before setting out. 
I stuck my thumb out on Rte 441 at 11:30, and was picked up by 11:45. A very nice young couple, vacationing from Asheville. They simply asked me “Where do you need to go?”. It was immediately apparent that they were not familiar with the area. I explained that my destination was 10-12 miles down the road, and they said “No problem, stick your pack in the back seat next to you.” I learned over the ride to the trailhead that they were just touring about the area, and would be happy to take wherever I wanted to go. I was very touched by their kindness. 
When I got out of the car, I immediately came upon hikers coming off the trail on their way into Gatlinburg. When I heard “Over here, Rodof!” I recognized George ( no trail name yet) and Jukebox. After a jubilant greeting, we chatted for awhile, and then went our own ways. We are sure we will catch up together again soon. 
The hike today was nothing short of fabulous. From a raw, drizzly, blustery start at Newfound Gap, the trail ascended for about 2.5 miles, then transitioned to a rolling ridge run, with modest ups and downs. The ascent took me above the local cloud level to a beautifully sunny sky with high, puffy clouds. The views along the ridge were stunning. Sometimes the ridge was only 6-8 feet wide. You had two views in this case - and they were quite different. To the northwest, you could see the tops of the mountain clouds that I hiked out of. The forefront of the view was shaded by the ridge. Mist, rising from the clouds below, was in motion due to the breeze. To the Southeast it was totally sunny and you could feel the warm air rising. A total contrast. Sometimes the trail dipped off the ridge to either side, dropping you into a cool, somewhat moist, mossy environment, or into the warm, bright sunshine. Sweet.","Newfound Gap

This obviously makes the hike easier, and enables a faster pace. Dinner - corned beef and cabbage- was very late, with the dinner bell ringing at 9PM. It was delicious, and I am happy I waited for the home cooked food. (Frozen pizza was the alternative.) There was plenty of energy and laughter around the fire, fueled in part by some local moonshine. It was a good crowd and a fun evening. 
Standing Bear was an interesting place. Nestled in the woods with a babbling brook running through the property, it had a nice ambience. But to be clear, it was rustic. Several cabins housed numerous bunks. I was happy I was able to score a single room, which was the upstairs of a “tiny house”, by the brook on the back end of the property. This was a very quiet room. 
I packed up a few cold weather items to send back home this morning. This allowed me to drop a few pounds of base weight. Now that I am north of the Smokies, and we are in the back half of March, the chances of running into seriously cold weather are diminishing. My original plan was to ship cold weather gear back around April 1, but with forecasted temps this week in the 70s, I decided the benefit/risk was worth it to do this now. Fingers crossed! 
Yet another great hiking day. Started with what seemed like an endless ascent, finally taking me to Max Patch, a beautiful Bald. Breathtaking. I would have pitched camp up there, but the winds were quite strong, and rain was forecasted for early morning, leading me to think the wind might actually kick up some more. So I pushed on to Roaring Fork Shelter. No problem falling asleep tonight!","Standing Bear Hostel

I arrived at the Deer Park Shelter at about 3:30 PM.  I could have pushed on into Hot Springs, but I would be getting into town a little on the late side, and I knew that lodging was limited due to several Corona virus driven closures.  (More on Corona later.). Besides my favorite watering hole at the University of Delaware was the Deer Park, so how could I pass up the opportunity to stay at the Deer Park Shelter?  Bluejeans, another hiker more or less on the same pace with me, was already there, and had started a fire.  We used some of the remaining daylight time to gather wood so we could maintain a nice fire into the evening.  And we did.   A few others arrived, and we chatted around the fire, staying up late by hiker standards, because virtually everyone was going into Hot Springs tomorrow.   We were asleep by 10PM.

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627201,"It was an easy hike this morning from Deer Park shelter into Hot Springs.   I arrived mid morning, to a town that was devoid of traffic, with many closed businesses.   This was a totally different situation in Gatlinburg last weekend.    Fortunately, the outfitter was still open, although they announced that they are closing end of day Saturday.  Also to my surprise, the Smoky Mountain Diner was not only doing carry out orders, but they were allowing people to sit at outdoor tables.   I was thrilled to be able to have meatloaf, mashed potatoes and green beans for lunch!Most of the group I had  been keeping pace with also arrived in Hot Springs this morning.  There is one hostel open, run by Blue Ridge Hiking Company.  The owner, a young lady named Lindsay, explained that although the ATC cannot force anyone to close, the owners of the other hostels in town are well over 60.   She believes their motivation for closing was due to their risk of exposure from hikers, given they are part of the higher risk demographic.  I decided to stay on the north side of town, at a place called the Iron Horse Inn.    It is a very charming place, that includes a nice restaurant on the first floor.  While it is usually packed for this time of year, only three rooms, including mine, were rented out. The owner said they would accommodate me with dinner from the restaurant. They even allowed Jukebox, Snafu, and Bluejeans, to join me for dinner at their bar.  ( They were officially open for carry out only.)  Another act of kindness.   It was a low-key evening, and the food was excellent.   We all felt very fortunate, because the Iron Horse, along with other restaurants here, are either already closed or operating on a day to day basis .It appears that many hikers are dropping off the trail. Our numbers are dwindling.   I remain optimistic that those of us who want to keep hiking can make it work.Oh, one other comment about this morning. While we were breaking down camp at the Deer Park Shelter, we heard a loud WHOMP in the forest, not very far away at all.   It was very startling.  Turns out it was a tree that fell.  I am now resolved to look up and around me before I choose my tent site in the future!","Deer Park Mountain Shelter

Our risk of being infected or infecting someone else has to be much lower than the general population.  I’m not saying there is zero risk, nor that we should not be taking precautions.  I even understand why hostels may shut down, since they are congregation points.  But it does not make sense to me that the second spot close to abandon their hike.  My intention is to continue, so long as I can get the necessary services I need, such as resupply.  Onward and upward!","Iron Horse Station Inn

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627235,"I got off to a leisurely start this morning. There was a nice group of folks who I had not met before at the hostel, and we enjoyed breakfast and chitchat together. Departed at 9AM to an unexpectedly beautiful day for hiking. Clouds and some rain had been forecasted, but the day was partly sunny and in the 50s. I had two choices. I could target either the Spring Mountain shelter at 11 miles, or the Little Laurel Shelter at about 20 miles. I decided to make a call on the fly. When I arrived at Spring Mountain shelter, it was close to 2 PM. The shelter was small and not well maintained. I was still looking at 5+ hours of sunlight, and it was a beautiful day, so this was an easy decision. Besides, the Hemlock Hollow hostel was another 5 miles away from Spring Mountain, so that could be a bail out if I suddenly tired. So off I went. On my way I did call the Hemlock Hollow, just to confirm that they were open, and learned that they too had closed. So I was committed to my biggest day yet, mileage-wise. This turned out to not be a problem. I got to Little Laurel earlier than expected, and was able to easily set up before nightfall. 
As I was arriving, the wind started to pick up quite a bit. They were averaging 10 to 15 mph, with gusts up to 20 to 25 mph. The rain that was forecasted for today finally came in, and it was a hard rain. Unfortunately the direction of the wind was directly into the shelter. This makes it difficult to stay warm. Looking on the positive, I am under cover, and I do not have to set up and breakdown a tent in the rain! Long night ahead.","Hot Springs

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627337,"Last night was not restful. The winds kept me from ever feeling warm and comfortable in my bag. Even though it is rated for 20 degrees, the wind just pulled heat from it faster than my body generated it inside the bag, so it got a bit chilly. When I awakened around 6:30, I could see the downpour outside, so I rolled over and committed to a late start. I do not mind hiking in the rain, but to start the day on a downpour, well that is a different story. 
Unrelated to the weather, I was alone at the shelter last night. It looks like I will be alone again tonight. This is unheard of for this time of year. As a matter of fact, prior to this hike I do not recall ever being at a shelter site without other hikers. (This is with > 400 miles of hiking on the AT prior to this adventure.). So far on this trip, it looks like it has happened three times! 

The hike today was uneventful. Low visibility, light rain and drizzle all day. There were some technical challenges along a ridge (Big Firescald Knob-  I’ll post photos) that were made more difficult with the wet rocks, leaves and mud. One is supposed to be rewarded for efforts like these with beautiful views, but none were to be had today.","Little Laurel Mountain Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627413,"As I suspected, I had the Flint Mountain Shelter to myself.   This is a nice shelter, well maintained with all the amenities you could expect- bear bag cables, privy, water close by. It is beautifully situated on a woody hillside.  Although it is as high as Little Laurel @3600 ft, it is a lot less exposed.  All of this made for a pleasant night.
I set a target for Bald Mountain today, which is an aggressive hike, not only due to the distance, but also because the ascent to the Bald (at 5000 ft+) is at the very end.  All went well in the AM, with good weather and trail conditions.  I had lunch at about 1:30at the Hogback Ridge Shelter, which is where things started to change.  First, I chose this shelter for lunch because it was listed as having a water source, and I definitely needed to water up.  However, the water source was a blue blaze trail that I walked for 15 mins before I gave up on it.  (It was listed in my guide as a 0.25 trail to the water, but that has to be an error.) I had to get going to make Bald Mountain by nightfall.  There were other water sources along the way; I was just annoyed that I wasted my time. So as I left Hogback Ridge Shelter following lunch, the weather took a turn for the worse.  I was expecting light rain, but the reality was strong winds and moderate rainfall.   I used my umbrella, but due to the sideways rain from the wind, I only succeeded in keeping my shoulders and head dry.   By 4PM the rain and wind eased up a bit, but the trail conditions worsened considerably.  Water pools and mud were everywhere.  One had to measure every step, because the ground would just slide out from under you.  This was especially problematic on the downhill sections. (Although I was ascending the mountain, the ascents are almost always sawtoothed, so the best way to think about an ascent is a prevailing uphill trend.)  Without exaggeration, I slid at least 3 feet on two separate occasions.  Miraculously, I did not fall either time!  By 6PM I was into the final ascent to the Bald, and it was steep, wet rock climbing.  The winds were picking up as I got closer to the Bald.  Once I got up there, the rain picked up again for good measure.   It was a mess on the Bald.  This was a storm, and I was in the middle of it, totally exposed.  The shelter was maddeningly close at 1-2miles away, so I forged ahead. Well, the folks who laid out the AT here set it up to basically circumnavigate the Bald, as best as I could tell.  This really tested my patience.  I was soaked to the bone.  Even my feet were wet (first time on this adventure).  I could not get to the shelter fast enough.  After what seemed like an endless tour of the top of the mountain, the trail finally turned off the Bald and into the woods.  After another 20-30 minutes, I was excited to see a sign for the shelter, about 0.1 miles off trail.  The sign also indicated water in a different direction from the shelter, so I watered up before heading to the shelter. (I knew that once there, I would be loathe to leave the shelter in this storm.). This consumed another 20 minutes.  So finally, at around 7PM, I arrived, fully expecting another solo night.  Well, much to my surprise I was greeted by 10 hikers who were already packed into the shelter.  (Most has overnighted at Hogback, where I had lunch.). Each space was separated from the other by 2X4 rails, nailed into the floor.  So it was not possible to simply squeeze in.   My only option was to set up my sleeping pad/bag on the stoop.  At this point, the storm was strengthening, with thunder.  The stoop was mostly dry, but that also means it was somewhat wet.  And the others in the shelter had to step over me if they needed to leave for any reason (pee break, anyone?).  There was precious little room.  Fortunately, folks were good natured and accommodating.    I just needed to get dry and warm ASAP.  I was shivering.  I changed clothes, and  was also able to make a hot meal (Knorr Spanish Rice), which helped immensely.  I used my bivy sack, which helped keep my sleeping bag somewhat dry. Needless to say, I did not get a great night’s sleep.  All things considered though, I felt some pride in managing through some difficult circumstances today, and making it through a miserable night.","Flint Mountain ShelterSent from my iPhon

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627414,"I woke up to a cold morning, with rain still falling.  I have to say I was very impressed with my sleeping bag performance, though.  It did a great job of expelling moisture through the night, as my body heat warmed up the interior. Although I had no desire to get out of my bag, I had a long way to go in order to get to Erwin, and I was pretty much in everyone’s way, as I lay on the stoop.  So I gutted it out and quickly broke down my setup.  The worst part was getting dressed back into my wet pants and hiking shirt.  (I did trade my socks out for my backup pair.) Yuck.  And Brrrrr!  As if I needed any more motivation to get moving!  As you’d guess, I made quick work of this and was out of there.
The rain was lightening up as I left, and within 2 hours had stopped entirely.  My body heat had helped dry out everything I was wearing.  The trail on this side of the mountains had a gentle downhill grade, and was not muddy.  By 1PM, the sun was trying to come out, with intermittent success.  By 3PM, it was a sunny, springlike day!   I took note of the emerging buds on the Rhododendrons, and am excited to see these bloom in the coming weeks.
I arrived in “outer Erwin” at about 5PM.  I was 4 miles out of town, and put my thumb to work.  Again, I was greeted with kindness.  The proprietor of a hostel about 20 miles up the trail (he introduced himself as Gadget) and two of his friends from Florida were out dayhiking, and finished about 30 minutes behind me.  None of them knew Erwin, but were happy to take me into town and find the Super 8 Hotel, which is the only show in town right now.  What kindness.  I resolved to stay at Gadget’s hostel.  It will take a 20 mile day on Friday to do it, but the weather should be good... so hopefully, no problem!
I restocked in Erwin, which should cover me through Sunday.  If all goes according to plan, I will arrive at the Mountain Harbor Hostel Sunday afternoon, where I will intercept my second resupply box from home.  (Thank you, Holly! XOXOXO)","Bald Miuntain Shelter

Poison was so named because he contracted Poison Sumac (he thinks) on his legs early on his hike. He is still suffering the effects. This still does not stop him from hiking in shorts. BC is short for Ball and Chain; he is Poison’s best bud, and this hike is his last hurrah as a single man. Poison is the architect of their through hike. He wants a life of adventure, and spent the evening telling me of his plans. He appeared genuine, passionate and knowledgeable (Poison is an Eagle Scout as well). A very likable guy. Poison and BC started 8 days after me and are planning for 30 miles today - so they are moving! 
The trail today took me to Beauty Spot, a pretty Bald about 10 miles out of Erwin. Just beyond, there was another ascent up Unaka Mountain, which took one through a very pretty pine forest, with lots of electric green moss undercover. I half expected to see a Leprechaun appear! Along the way, I received some trail magic at Indian Grave Gap. Brother John has made it his mission to set up “every non rainy weekday” at this gap for the past seven years. I enjoyed a lemonade and a slice of banana bread with him. More kindness. I have to say that the trail from Erwin northward has been pretty fantastic. Very pretty, with great trail conditions overall. 
I made my goal today, rolling into the Greasy Creek Friendly at about 7:30PM. The hostel was about 3/4 mile off trail, but worth the effort. Gadget’s partner (wife, I think) Connie was running the show, and they were both very hospitable. Connie observes the Sabbath, so she was in a rush to get me settled - and fed- before sundown. The hostel is in a dry county, so they did not sell beer, but Gadget offered me one from his personal stash. All told, I had a beer, a microwave burger (that Connie dressed up with fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion), a ham and cheese sandwich, a bag of potato chips, and a pint of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream (Cherry Garcia, of course). And yes, I ate the whole pint! I did not realize how hungry I was! Connie let me do a load of laundry- she normally does that herself, but we were into the Sabbath by then. Then, in the morning I had a couple cups of coffee, a microwave egg sandwich, and a banana. I am telling you this so you can appreciate with me that my bill for everything was $25.25. And Connie sent me off in the AM with an additional sandwich for lunch, a carton of apple juice, and raisins -all for no extra charge.

I arrived there in the early afternoon, and there were hundreds of people at the trail head, venturing up to Round Bald. I have to believe that the size of the crowd was due to the fact that there was no place else for folks to go. Once I got past Round Bald, the crowds thinned considerably.

It occurred to me that I should explain a bit about blazing, following my comments yesterday. White blazes mark the official AT. Blue blazes are typically spur trails or part of another trail system altogether, or occasionally an alternate route to white blazes. When an alternate, blue blazes are usually an easier alternative to the white blaze trail. When you blue blaze, you are not hiking the AT. Yellow blazing is a term also used to describe the act of skipping a section of the trail. Obviously, yellow blazing is a bad thing, usually used as an accusatory term. Aquablazing is a made up term to describe what Snafu and Bluejeans we’re attempting. There is even a term I have heard a few ties called pink blazing, which is the actor a hiker accelerating or decelerating in order to keep pace with someone they are attracted to!

The trail follows along Laurel Creek for over 10 miles.  It also tracks with the Creeper Trail - a significant bike trail that makes Damascus a destination location.  ( it is called the Creeper Trail because the steam engine that there was called the Creeper.). The hike was beautiful and it was wonderful to hear the rushing water of Laurel Creek.  I have to say again, down in these parts what is called a creek looks and sounds to me like a river.  (Actually, creeks are tributaries tonrivers.) The afternoon brought a few thundershowers. This was a bit of a surprise, but no real bother, as temperatures were in the 70s.   I arrived at Lost Mountain Shelter at about 5:45, leaving plenty of time for watering up, site setup, dinner prep, cleanup and organizing for bed.","Broken Fiddle Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627570,"We had an active weather pattern last night.  There was lots of howling wind above, but a milder, variable wind on the ground at our site.   Occasional wind gusts came from time to time.  It was not particularly cold; I am guessing temperatures were in the low 40s.


 I woke up to a cool, breezy, foggy day.  Visibility was around 50-75 yards.  The first several miles hiking were still in the Grayson Highlands, so the  atmosphere was surreal, given the fast moving fog, and the landscape.


By late morning the fog had lifted- or moved out with the wind.  I had a late lunch at Hurricane Shelter(2PM) and decided to press on to Trimpi Shelter. My feet were sore from the terrain, but my legs felt great.  I had taped my big toe in the AM because I felt a hotspot there, and it seemed to be holding up well.  After about 5 miles, I ran into a detour at Dickey Gap.  A bridge had been condemned, so a reroute was necessary. This is not a big deal in and of itself, except the reroute in this case included 2 miles of walking on a macadam road.  Now I cannot explain why, but hard surface roads are not kind to my feet when I am in my hiking boots.  I could feel the hotspot shouting at me.  I arrived at Trimpi at about 6 PM, very happy to have put in a 20 mile day. 


When I arrived at Trimpi, I found Weatherman there, and learned that Mango and Blue Jeans were going to try and go all the way to Partnership shelter. This would be a 30 mile day for them!  Weatherman was packing up and preparing to move on himself.  His plan was to go another three or four miles to a tent site.  I had no intention of going any further.  Well, not 5 minutes after Weatherman left, thunder started, and the winds picked up.  Weatherman arrived back at the shelter just as the rain started.  I had just finished teasing him about his trail name and his decision making, when the storm rapidly accelerated and began dropping hail on us as well.   Boy were we glad we were in a shelter.  I would not want to be exposed to that.  Bluejeans and Mango were undoubtably in the middle of this, and I felt bad for them.  The storm subsided after about 20 minutes.   But the active weather pattern of the past day continued.  I would not be surprised to see more storms tonight.  Unfortunately without any service, I am unable to check my weather apps!  ","Wise Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627572,"I was awakened in the middle of the night last night with a thunderstorm of epic proportions.  I honestly do not believe I have ever seen it rain so hard.  I am certain that if I was in that storm in a tent, that the rain would have penetrated it and I would have been soaked .


I got off to an early start this morning, and I’m looking forward to getting to the Partnership Shelter which is located right next to the Pat Jennings Visitor Center.  This is about a 10 mile hike.  There is a shuttle that runs from the visitor center into the town of Marion several times a day.  Halfway through my hike, I called ahead to make sure that it was still running and learned that it was.  Scheduled pick ups were 8AM/11AM/2 PM.  So if I hustled, I would be able to make the 11 AM shuttle.  Despite my screaming feet, I put it into overdrive.  I was happy to arrive at the visitor center at 10:55AM.  Net, I hiked almost 10 miles in under four hours!


Marion is a pretty spread out town. I spent the afternoon finding a hotel, getting lunch, resupplies, and Epsom salts for my feet.  Holly sent me a new pair of boots for pick up as well.  All to say I probably walked another 3 miles taking care of business this afternoon.    


I will take a zero day tomorrow, to give my feet some rest and soaking.  Tonight is a good night to be off the trail, because the temperature will be dropping into the 20s, and the wind is again picking up. Tomorrow will be a cold and blustery day.   All considered, a good time for a zero.","Trimpi Shelter

This includes updating this journal, both entries and photographs. My only excursion was a midday trip to the grocery store for lunch and dinner items (rotisserie chicken, anyone?).  I soaked my feet with Epsom salts three different times!


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> Keep in mind that there were at most 3 other guests here.  They provided me the tub for my feet, gave a shuttle  driver recommendation, made a pot of coffee for me in the AM, and even turned up the hot water  temp for me (it really needed it- the water was tepid at best.   Plus, they expressed their sorrow that they could not provide cleaning service for the room, due to current coronavirus regulations.  This was especially nice because this is a worn down place.  Their kindness made it a good experience.


Speaking of kindness, I have another example to share with you that occurred here in Marion.  I mentioned above that the folks here at the hotel gave me the phone number for a shuttle driver. When I called the number, the shuttle driver’s wife (who is named Terry), took my call.  She told me her husband was not available at the moment.  She then asked if I minded if she called me back in a few minutes.  Less than 10 minutes later, the phone rang and it was her. Terry went into a deep explanation regarding her concerns about the coronavirus, especially because her husband has COPD.  Terry told me she tried two other shuttle drivers in the time since we hung up, and one of them could not do it and the other was still yet to call back. All she had to do was tell me they were closed.  For her take it upon herself to pursue this in order to help out a perfect stranger really impresses me.  


I keep finding kindness on the AT.

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627599,"The day was off to a relaxed start, as our (sharing with Weatherman) shuttle was not leaving until 10:30AM.  I enjoyed a couple of microwaveable breakfast sandwiches, two bananas and some orange juice that I picked up at the grocery store yesterday.  Then I set out to try and fit all my provisions in my backpack.  I always try to pack an extra days worth of food in case I get stuck in the mountains. So, with my next resupply point being Pearisburg, I need to pack 6 days of food.  This is a lot to fit in my bag.  With some work and creativity, I finally succeeded.  I do not have a scale, but my pack weight has to be over 40 lbs with all this food.


I was hiking by 11AM.  The hike was not notable; the day was nice enough, but there was not much to see and the terrain was rocky.  I never felt like I had my hiking legs, and once again my feet were getting beat up.   So, not the greatest hike, but got some decent miles in with a late start.   The campsite is nice, and Weatherman and I had it to ourselves.   I was tired, probably due to not sleeping very well at the Travel Inn (very old, worn out mattress).   So it was an early bedtime.   Ahhhh.","Partnership Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627605,"Today was a disappointment.  4 miles into the hike, the footbridge over Lick Creek was washed out.  Apparently this occurred very recently; March 26, to be precise.  This was not a total surprise, as it was posted several miles back.   I had also received a text from Bluejeans in which he also described getting across the creek on a log.  I did not view this as a serious problem.  I was making assumptions about the size of the creek, and failed to account for the 16 hours of rain that had just occurred.  As I progressed through my first four miles and saw the gushing flows of the mountain streams, my sense of comfort disappeared.  Two of the mountain streams were so overflowing that I had no choice but to walk through them, getting me wet to mid-shin.  When I got to Lick Creek, I was stunned.  It was much wider than I had imagined, and was flowing at a very rapid clip.  The water levels were quite high.  And the bridge was completely washed out onto the opposite side of the creek. Fording this today was out of the question.  So me and my wet feet -and Weatherman- turned around and hiked back to the shelter.  Eight miles of hiking and this is technically a zero day.  I was back at the shelter by noon.


I spent the afternoon looking at possible detour options.  It was particularly frustrating to have poor phone service, given that I was tying to get information.   I was able to speak to a hostel owner who said the only detour he could recommend would be to drop me off 20 miles up trail from Lick Creek.  I would have to walk south 20 miles to get to the other side of the creek then turn around and walk the 20 miles again northbound. Ugh.Two new arrivals came to the Shelter.  OT, who started March 11 -yes, 16 days after me- and Uncle Jim, who I had met before.  Weatherman, myself and the new arrivals discussed our plan for tomorrow.  We would assess the river level in the AM,  and determine whether it would be safe to proceed.  We would all be prepared to say “No” and again hike back to the shelter and accept another one day delay.  I am happy we are of one mind here.  ","Knot Maul Branch Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627619,"I did not sleep well.  I was nervous about the day ahead.  Two of my hiking companions are in their mid 20s, and are raring to go. The third, Uncle Jim, is on his own program, and will not be part of the group.   So my two partners have a natural, youthful bias to plow ahead. I am the most cautious. 


We got off to a reasonably early start (8AM).   I was encouraged on the way down by the reduced flow- and in many cases, the absence of flow -in the mountain runoff streams.  I was able to use the stepping stones, as they were no longer under water.  When we arrived at Lick Creek, I was amazed to see the water levels down by three to four feet.   Fording definitely looked so-able.  The three of us crossed together to support each other in case of a slip or stumble.  Fortunately, it was an easy, but wet, crossing.


Following the fording, Weatherman and OT hiked off into the distance ahead, as their natural pace is faster than mine.  The ensuing walk was quite nice. Following a three or four mile ascent, one was treated to a beautiful ridgewalk.  There were several occasions where you had fabulous views on either side.  Sweet!


I ate my lunch at Chestnut Knob Shelter. As I was studying my Guthook (AT map app) guide, I noticed that there was a hostel -Garden Mountain Hostel- just a few miles short of Jenkins Shelter, my original destination.  Given my boots and socks were still damp, and the temperatures tonight or do to drop into the 20s, I made a game time decision this afternoon to go to the hostel. 


Garden Mountain is a farm property that is still in the process of being renovated and converted to a hostel property.  I slept in a private bedroom in the residence, which is a 100+ year old home.  A barn nearby is being converted into a sizable bunkhouse with men’s and women’s baths, as well as a kitchen and communal area.  Otzi, the on site manager,explained to me that business this March is down 90% vs  last year.  Tellingly, I was the only patron today.  I hope they make it work here.  The financial challenges appear immense. ","Knot Maul Branch Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627652,"Everything came together today.  A sunny, crisp morning followed a light snowfall last night. Trail conditions were excellent -few roots, few rocks, and not much blowdown.  Elevation changes were a modest grade.  So basically the conditions were perfect for increased pace. I usually estimate 2mph for my pace.  So today’s 18 mile hike should have taken me nine hours.  I did it in seven.  What a day!  It was exhilarating!


Much of the hike was a ridge trail.  As in the Smokies, sometimes the trail was at the top of the ridge, affording panoramic views to the left and right.  Other times, the trail dipped to either face of the mountain by 50 feet or so, and ran parallel to the very top of the ridge.  Cool, stiff breezes prevailed on the shady northerly face, with calm, sunny conditions on the southerly face.  From time to time on the south  face, a short burst of warm air would rise up and envelope me.  This was delicious.  It was like Mother Nature was giving me a hug!


Arrived at Helvey’s Mill with plenty of time to set up.  This was a good thing because the water source was over a quarter miles away- and downhill.   This means I have to schlep my water uphill.  Oh well, they say “take what the trail gives you”.  I had a very nice quiet evening with the site all to myself.  As the sun started to fall behind the mountain to the west, I was reminded of how fast it gets cold in the mountains.   In a matter of minutes, I was shivering!  Time for bed.","Garden Mountain Hostel

One other (small) milestone of note today was that I passed the 600 mile mark.  


On the way in to VA 606, I crossed Kimberling Creek.  The creek runs parallel to 606. The footbridge over the creek was a suspension bridge!  This is yet another illustration of how big creeks are in this part of the country.  Happily, I was not here a few days earlier, because the evidence of the flooding suggests it was a mess.  Kimberling Creek makes Lick Creek look like a little stream.  I was fortunate to come upon Trent’s gas station/grocery about 4 o’clock this afternoon, which allowed me to enjoy a couple of chicken salad sandwiches for an early dinner.  Yes, a couple of sandwiches.  And a bag of chips.  I passed on the ice cream.

I hiked through numerous stretches of rhododendron “forests”- some of which were more than a half mile long.  While these can be there is not a whole lot to see, and it can become mundane.  I found myself wishing they would end, and just wanted to see the sky.  Today’s hike also included numerous stretches of trail that doubles as mountain runoff streams.  These were pretty chunky, with lots of mud, loose rock, leaves and sticks.   Overall, pretty tough on one’s feet.  After an early lunch at Wapiti Shelter, I ascended out of this to a nice ridge walk.  Ahh, the sunshine was delightful!  


As I scanned Guthook (my AT navigation app) in a break, I noted Woods Hole Hostel was just a couple miles short of Docs Knob Shelter, my intended target for the day.  My plan was to spend the night at Doc’s Nob, and then hike into Pearisburg Saturday morning.  I would overnight in a hotel in Pearisburg, resupply and resume my hike on Sunday or Monday.  I learned from some of my hike or companions ahead of me that the hotels in Pearisburg were quite forgettable, so I called Woods Hole and found them to be open for business with a restricted number of guests.   So I changed plans, and went to Woods Hole this afternoon, arriving about 3:30 PM.   This is a beautiful property about a half mile off the trail.  The centerpiece is a chestnut log cabin built in the 1880’s, and beautifully restored.

I packed a 5 day resupply to hold me until Daleville, assuming all goes according to plan.  Daleville is 105 miles ahead, so this is an aggressive plan.  I do have an option to get to Four Pines Hostel at 80 miles, so I have a contingency.  Fact is, the towns and hostels are stretching out a bit.  So my pack will be heavy tomorrow morning.  The weather looks reasonable for the upcoming week.  Fingers crossed that it stays that way!

It was a cool, moist foggy morning of hiking.   I elected a late lunch since I started so late, and ate at the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter, about 12 miles in.  The hiking had been relatively easy, with a ridge was a d then a descent down a mountain to the shelter.   I ran into another southbound hiker, who had also started at Harpers Ferry, and also had no issues to report.  He was already set up at Pine Swamp, and even had a fire going.   This shelter was particularly nice, with an indoor fireplace.   It was tempting to join him, but I was not eager to make it that short of a day and hang out for the remainder of the afternoon.   Besides, the next four miles were a one thousand foot ascent to Bailey Gap Shelter, and I would not want that first thing tomorrow if I could avoid it.  So on I went after my late lunch.  This was a good call.  The terrain turned pretty rocky and rooty, which slowed me down.  I had had enough hiking for the day by the time I arrived here.   Once again, I had to get water on the way in as none is available at the shelter site.  Not so fun.  However, the water source was quite pretty, with wild hastas growing all around the area, so it made the trip pleasant.

Well, the ridge trail got pretty rocky.  No, very rocky.  In fact, it transitioned into a pretty technical hike, as the ridge became 100% flat sloped boulders.   A slip could easily drop you at least 30 feet, and in some sections much more.  As I mentioned, the ridge run went for several miles.  So what I assumed would be a quick pace turned into a slow pace.  And daylight was burning.  I wanted to step up my pace, but the risk was too high, given the potentially disastrous consequences.  Long story short, I finished the ridge portion at about 8PM, just as the sun was setting.  After 30 minutes of twilight, I was now night hiking with my headlamp.  This is not something I wanted to do.  Fortunately, I was within 15 minutes of Niday Shelter, so this was a short night hike.  All that said, the views along the ridge were fabulous.

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627776," I spent the night alone at Bobblets.  A very pleasant sleep, but noted my air mattress was a bit depleted when I woke up.   I was on the trail by 7:45 today.  This was later than I desired, mostly due to a slow breakdown and pack up.  The day was beautiful, if not a bit windy.   I like the wind, to a point.  I would say blustery is nice.  But when the winds get aggressive and noisy, I do feel uncomfortable.  One gets reminded of the power of wind routinely in the mountains, when you see trees blown down, sometimes in large numbers. And occasionally, you are there to hear it, if not see it.  


Wildflowers are popping out.  I am finding myself preoccupied with the flowers and sometimes missing the grandiose.  For example, a couple of days ago I walked right past a 300 year old oak tree- which was marked on my maps as a waypoint.   There is just so much to see... The other beauteous sight that only lasts a day or two is occurring right now.  And that is when the leaves just start to pop out and one can look at the forest and still see the complex structure of the trees, but with all the green leaf buds adding a rich green color to the mix.  This is a very transient occurance,  lasting only a few days at most.


Highlight today was the Guillotine rock formation.   I will include this in the pictures.  The trail passes between two large boulders, with a third smaller boulder stuck in between them overhead.  You must walk underneath.  Now this rock formation has probably been this way a couple thousand years, if not more, but I have to tell you, I did not waste any time walking through this!


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> I arrived at about 7:30, logging another 20+ mile day today.  This sets me up for a hostel stay and resupply in Glasgow tomorrow, 15 miles out.  Another owl is nearby, telegraphing his presence.  It is just us tonight.  Sweet.","Bobblets Gap Shelter​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627777," I woke up in the night (3AM) to find my sleeping pad losing air.  Bad news.  I reinflated it and was able to fall back asleep.  By 6 AM it was empty again, but it was time to get up anyway.  Very lucky for me to have a hostel visit planned tonight as it gives me a good opportunity to find the leak and repair it.


I was much more efficient this morning, and was hiking by 7AM. under cool, cloudy conditions.  Trail conditions were pretty good, overalI.  I reached the James River by 1PM.
Charlie, the manager for Stanimal’s Hostel in Glasgow, picked me up and shuttled me into town.  Charlie could not be nice or more service oriented.  After showing me around the hostel, he let me know he was available to drive me into town for a resupply/lunch run.  This was only a half mile away at the most.  Charlie explained that he thru hiked last year, and knows that any “extra miles” that can be avoided are much appreciated.  He is so right about that.  


I took care of my pad, laundry, and showered in the afternoon.  I also met three friendly older guy (like me) northbound hikers.  Double Zero, Oso, and Big Sky started before me, and appear to have teathered together.  Also, Weatherman was here.  Turns out he has been here a few days, falling off the trail with blistered feet.  Apparently he changed shoes in Daleville, and the new model is not agreeing with his feet.  


Before I knew it, dinner time was here and Charlie again ran those of us who were interested back into town to the sub shop for carry out.  So today I had an Italian sub for lunch, and a meatball sub for dinner, with a bag of bugles in between.  And let’s not forget the brownies and ice cream!  My appetite is amazing me. ","Thunder Hill Shelter​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627819,"I got off to a later start than I desired today, since Charlie’s only constraint - and a reasonable one at that- was that we all shuttle to the trailhead together.  His default departure time was 7:30.  However, Charlie did offer a pancake breakfast, and all of us happily accepted.  Given that, we agreed on a departure time of 8:30.  I was the only hiker keen to get going, as the trio (Oso, Big Sky and Double Zero) only had their sights set on a ten mile day.  They had initially suggested a 10AM departure, and so were accommodating me by going earlier.  In the end, we drove off to the trailhead a little after 9AM, and I was hiking by 9:30.


We had yet another god day for hiking, with a nice breeze and temps in the 60’s.  I wonder how long this good fortune will last!  I stopped at the Punch Bowl Shelter (this is where the trio was headed) for lunch at about 1:30.  I noted that the fire ring was smoking a bit as I unpacked for lunch.  This is not totally unusual, but not a condition anyone should ever leave behind.  I was thinking I would extinguish it after I ate.  However, within minutes of my arrival, I was joined by a couple of Forest Service employees who were responding to a call regarding this fire.  Apparently a day hiker, who was a retired Forest Service employee, called it in.  I am still puzzled why this person did not just extinguish the fire, as a pond was less than 200 feet away.  I can only guess that they must not have had any container to deal with it.  Anyway, the two guys who arrived to out this out were very nice and we chatted it up while I ate my lunch. I learned that severe storms were now being forecasted for tonight, expected to drop a couple of inches of rain.  I had not seen this when I checked the weather this morning.  Sure enough, when I rechecked my app (I use Dark Sky) there it was, in bold red print:  FLOOD WARNING.   Well, that out some fire in my boots, because I had another 10 miles to go.  So off I went!  Fortunately, the trail ahead of me was predominately flat to downhill, with only a few minor climbs.  I had to cross a brook, which I was happy to do today instead of tomorrow. The crossing requires one to navigate about 8 stepping stones, and four of them had water rushing over them.  I was not successful, and fell in.  I had my poles well planted, so it was not a free fall.   Now the brook was not deep, but I did get wet.  I was only in the water an instant, so amazingly, the insides of my boots stayed dry.  I was wet to my knees and elbows, but really nothing serious.  And it was warm outside.  Luck was on my side this time.  By the time I arrived at the shelter, about a half hour later, I was essentially dry.


So I am hunkered down, awaiting the storm.  So far it is a still, warm night.  The usual steep temperature decline immediately following sunset has not occurred.  Moths are flitting about for the first time.  The calm before the storm is a bit unsettling.

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627820,"I did not sleep well last night. It was very active outside, with the breeze picking up a bit, as I tried to fall asleep.  The shelter is fairly nestled near the bottom of a gap, on a hillside by a strong flowing brook.  I could hear the wind above, howling.  I heard a loud cracking sound and concluded it must have been a dead tree limb getting blown down.  But down at the shelter, the wind was but a breeze.  By midnight the rain started, and it was cooling down quickly now.  I was happy for the cooler air, as I think the unusually mild evening kept me awake.  I fell asleep.  I woke again a few times through the night.  Was up, packed and ready to go at 7:30. 


Drizzle, fog and cool air prevailed until about 1PM.  There was not much to comment on, except that I did see a Baltimore Oriole in the afternoon. It has been many years since I have seen one, so that was a treat.  The drizzle stopped, but the fog and clouds persisted through the day, eliminating any summit or ridge views.  


I ran into a family heading southbound as I entered the Priest Forest, around 5PM. Mom, Dad, and four children from four to nine years old were section hiking.  They had been out for weeks, doing various sections of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.   Mom told me they had packed 10 days worth of food. Their next resupply was to be Daleville, which is over 100 miles south of here.  We did not have time for the million questions I wanted to ask.  They were headed to Seeley-Woodworth Shelter, over 4 miles away.  They said they expected to get there after dark, since they hike slowly with the kids.  They were totally blasé about what they were doing; in fact they mentioned that their stove broke so they were now cooking in the campfire.  And they were joyfully excited about the bears they saw a few hours earlier -Mom and two cubs.  I am still scratching my head.  The risks these folks are taking seem pretty high to me.

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627821,"Today was a tougher hiking day than the mileage would indicate.  There was a lot of “billy goat” hiking across rock spills, and a couple of challenging brook/stream crossings due to high runoff (still) from the storm two nights ago. One of them took me almost 15 minutes, as I scoured around looking for the best crossing point.  I also took my worst fall on the hike so far.  It occurred on a steep descent, when my toe caught a root as I was bringing it forward. This caused me to lurch forward.  The steepness of the hill caused me to head downhill uncontrollably. It was all I could do to get my legs underneath me. Fortunately I only went 15 or 20 feet, before hitting a large tree.  Had I gone much further, my speed and impact would have been much greater.  As it was, my point of contact with the tree was my head. So I got my bell rung, and sustained a few scratches. This was a grim reminder of the ever present hazards of backpacking.  I was very lucky, and resolve to maintain my concentration, especially on descents.


I arrived at Maupin Field Shelter at 4PM, which is an early stop time.  The next tent site is just 3 miles north- and the one after that is  almost 12 miles north.  So, too close or too far to justify leaving the shelter site, with it’s amenities.  I elected to stay here and make it an early night.   My target for tomorrow is Waynesboro, which will be a 20 mile day.  Looks very do-able on the maps, but trail condition makes a huge difference.  We shall see!


It is Friday night, and weekend hikers are arriving.  I’ve counted about 10 so far.  The proximity to Waynesboro and the views fro Three Ridge and Priest Mountains are driving the activity.  I guess is was a good thing I arrived early!","The Priest Shelter​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627822,"The weekend hikers kept on coming last night, with some arriving well after dark.  As best as I could tell, there were well beyond 20 hikers at the Maupin Shelter site.  And there were five or six dogs, all but one unleashed, running around, usually followed by an owner repeatedly exhorting their dog to come to them.  So it was not a quiet night.


After two weeks of consistent improvement in my feet, I developed a couple of serious hot spots yesterday on my right foot.  I treated and taped the affected areas, glad that I will end my day in Waynesboro, where I should be able to soak them.  


I got off before 7AM, having gotten up a little earlier than usual due to an owner calling out to her dog.  There is a trailhead and parking lot less than 2 miles from the shelter, and I passed by 3-4 stealth (i.e. not official) tent sites set up.  The parking lot was overflowing with cars. With Skyline Drive closed, I think weekend hikers are going to the next closest trailhead where they can access parking.  As I progressed north to Waynesboro, I encountered a fairly steady stream of day hikers.  The first 10 miles of the hike was on very rocky trail, which proved to be  hard on my feet. I could feel the hotspots screaming at me.  I stopped to retape my feet,  and while that helped, it did not prevent further deterioration.  


I arrived at the intersection of Skyline Drive and US64 at about 4PM, and Cora from Stanimal’s arrived to pick me up within minutes of my phone call.  After I dropped my bag at Stanimal’s, I went to the Walmart to pick up food for dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow morning.  I was surprised to see that the Walmart was pretty well picked over, with many out of stock items.

Today was foggy and wet, but the terrain was very nice.   Gentle grades, and not especially rocky or rooty.  My feet appreciated this as well!  I have to say this was the easiest 20 mile stretch of AT trail I have experienced yet.


It was a pleasant night at Blackrock hut.  Magician built a fire, as he carries no stove and does all of his cooking on campfires.  Turns out that Magician is quite a performer.  He worked in Renaissance Festivals as an actor, and shared his singing and dancing skills with us.  This led to others sharing their singing skills as well, and I have to say that it was really quite entertaining!","Waynesboro, Stanimal’s Hostel​

My plan going in to SNP was to attempt to complete the 108 mile journey in five days.  I had provisions for six days, if needed.  All to say I wanted to do the 28 miles.  However, challenging weather was rolling in, courtesy of the polar vortex.  The forecast was for rain to start in the afternoon, with steadily dropping temperatures.  Tonight would drop below freezing.  It was already windy - howling windy at times- through last night.  I also was cognizant that I had just completed three 20+ mile days, albeit on pretty forgiving terrain overall.  So I set out at 6AM, resolving to assess the situation at mile 15.

Holly, Kaiser, Pabs, and I enjoyed a leisurely morning while I packed up.  Due to the foot bridge over the Potomac River being closed, Holly had to shuttle me to the Weverton trail head this cuts out about 3 miles of the trail, but the only alternative would have been for me to hike up Rte 340, which would have been extremely dangerous.  


I was on the trail at 11 o’clock, sad to see our time together come to such a quick end.  It was a warm day already, and I had over 10 miles to go.  Hiker activity was noticeably increasing. It was a nice day, and the weekend is starting.  In the back half of the afternoon, as I approached Gathland State Park, I took a pretty bad spill.  The trail was actually quite clear, but there was one stealth route sticking up that I did not see and it caught my toe. I was hiking briskly so I went down quickly, and this resulted in a face plant. Since the trail was clear, I did not land on any rock.  But I did hit with enough force that I was pretty disoriented for a few minutes.  I am now sporting a split lip and banged up chin as a result.  Still, I am considering myself quite lucky.


I arrived at the Rocky Run shelter site to find a group of seven new thru hikers already set up for the evening.  All but one were tenting, so I took a shelter spot.  It turns out that the group found each other on Facebook, and started their thru hike out of Harpers Ferry on Thursday.  So this was day two for them.  They were a very nice group, and I enjoyed chatting it up with them.  They had established themselves as a “trail family”, aka tramily in trail parlance.   This was a good thing, because it was pretty apparent that these folks were inexperienced hikers, I am very very very supportive of one another.  However, the evening progressed, a dynamic of trail families that I am not fond of emerged.  As they conversed about their plans for tomorrow, they progressively convinced themselves to do shorter mileage.  One of the members had identified that pizza delivery was available at a campsite 2 miles up trail, and they concluded that it would be a good idea to make that their target for the day and enjoy a leisurely afternoon with carry out pizza.  Net, they talked themselves into a 2 mile hiking day.  This is an extreme example, but I have seen this happen several times on the trail now. When tramilies get established, they tend to hike to the lowest common denominator, and it can really slow folks down if everyone if not on the same page.  Personally, while I certainly enjoy the social interactions on the trail, I really believe in the principle of “hike your own hike”.


One other curious observation from this evening was that one of the hikers decided to bring his car on this hike with him. He plans to drive his car north to a drop off point, and then hire a shuttle to take him back to the tramily.  He said he was doing this because he is concerned about getting stuck somewhere. I fail to see the logic in this, but of course did not debate the point.","Weverton Road

One of the tramily believed she heard a bear outside of her tent.  There were at least two dogs at the shelter grounds, so this was very unlikely. In any event, she chose to evacuate her tent and rush into the shelter with her sleeping pad and bag.  She was frightened, and it was quite a commotion. 


I am planning to get to Boiling Springs, PA, by Tuesday afternoon for resupply. This requires several  big days, so I was up early and out of camp by 7AM.  As I passed through Washington Monument State Park, I could see the crowds building.  It is Saturday, and a beautiful day at that.  As I proceeded northward, the crowds became overwhelming. Without exaggeration I encountered over 200 hikers today. Virtually all of them were day hikers.  I found that I was a bit of a curiosity to many.  I was repeatedly stopped and asked a litany of (the same) questions.  This did not help my forward progress, but it is good to see people enjoying the outdoors, and interested in hiking.


My target today was the Raven Rock Shelter.  There is a substantial climb to get to the shelter, and no water source on the shelter grounds.    The closest Spring was almost a half mile away. So I had to pack water in to camp from a cascade on the climb up.  What a pain.  I am glad I did that however, because otherwise I would have gotten to the shelter and then be faced with a total round-trip of almost a mile just to get water replenished.

They took the upper level of the shelter.  A young man (ex-marine) and his girlfriend, camping for the night, set up close by and made a very nice fire just outside the shelter.  Everyone was quite nice and we had a very pleasant evening.  About 9 o’clock, we were interrupted by a patrol of three ATVs that came up to the site via a service road.  The group leader said that they had received a phone call indicating that there was a problem.  We told them that we knew nothing about that, and they proceeded to patrol around the grounds.  They were wearing no identifying tags or uniforms, so I cannot say for sure what organization they were from, if any.  The Marine said he has been here before and seen this happen.  I thought that to be rather odd, suggesting that these ATV patrols happen with regularity.  In any event, it was not of any consequence, and over rather quickly.  ","Rocky Run

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628119," Well, for the third night in a row my sleep was disturbed.  B 12-year-old boy who was sleeping in the loft had a tough night. I am not sure what the problem was he was not well settled. His dad was very attentive and did his best, but all in all I did not get a restful night.


I put down some miles today, in order to set up a short day into Boiling Springs on Tuesday. The morning was rainy, as expected, but it was not overly chilly.  The rain stopped at lunchtime, just as I was arriving at Tumbling Run Shelter.  This was a beautifully maintained shelter, and the caretakers happen to be there when I arrived.  I was very nice, and provided me with some insights regarding the trail going forward.  My interaction with them was brief, as they were leaving as I was arriving.  They did make a point of telling me, and another hiker who had arrived, at the shelter is technically closed, Even though the trail was open. They also said they had no problem with us lunching there. I did note that the privy was locked up.  I thought this to be a bit extreme, as many day hikers may not be prepared to do their business in the woods.


In the afternoon, as I checked my trail guide app (Guthook), I learned that there was a cheeseburger joint about a quarter-mile off the trail on PA Rte 30, 2 miles before my target-Quarry Gap Shelter.  This enabled me to stop for dinner at about 5:30 PM, and then complete my hike in the early evening.  OMG, the burgers and milkshake were good.  They were very well prepared - brioche bun, red onion, Boston lettuce, flavorful tomatoes, and sharp cheddar cheese.  The only downside was the uphill climb to quarry gap on a very full stomach.  A small price to pay!


Quarry Gap is a beautiful shelter.  It included tothree person shelters, joined with a covered patio and picnic table in between them. It was 30 feet away from a small babbling brook.  A chair swing place located next to the shelter, and a couple of raised tent pads were also available.  There were even several hanging flower pots with blooming pansies in them!  Once again, I ran into Magician, who was as effervescent as ever.  I also met another thru hiker for the first time, whose name is Yellow Submarine.  Sub Is very nice, and my age.  He is a recently retired engineer who worked in the nuclear power industry after serving in the Navy on a submarine in the early 80s.

While lacing my shoes for another big mileage day of hiking, the nylon outer weave of my shoelace stripped.  Wow I could always use some of my airbag cord as a temporary replacement, I knew I was going to have to get new laces as soon as possible. As I thought about it, I have over 500 miles on my boots, and I am heading into very rocky territory.  I was initially thinking I would use my old boots because I think they will get torn up by the rocks, but I am now thinking that fresh soles will help me manage the potentially slippery rocks better.  So I contacted Holly and asked if she could overnight a pair of replacement pair of boots to Lisa’s Hostel, where I am planning to stay in Boiling Springs.  Of course, Holly is all over it.


I arrived at the James Frey shelter, following a rather uninspired day of hiking. The landscape in this section of Pennsylvania yielded a scorched earth kind of experience.  Miles of dead trees, and the forest floor had been subject to a controlled burn some time ago. On top, there was a lot of loose rock on the trail.  This gave my feet and ankles quite a workout.  A zero day on Wednesday is looking good!  


Sub was at the James Fry (aka Tagg Run)  shelter as well, and we had a nice conversation into the evening.  Seems that we have a lot in common.  We are both staying at Lisa‘s hospital tomorrow night, so we decided to hike together tomorrow.   


 There was a bunk in the shelter that appeared to be fully set up with backpack, boots, jacket, food, etc.  It appeared that someone was already set up for the evening, but was away from the site for some reason. After an hour or two, with no one arriving, we looked a little more closely and determined that these things had been there for quite some time.   For example, there was a pot with some dried out Ramen noodle remains in it.   There was also a missing person flier hung up on the shelter wall, and oddly, the backpack on the missing person photo looked like the same backpack in the shelter.  Needless to say, I am happy I was not at the site alone.","Quarry Gap

Sub and I found a nice Italian restaurant, that had all of the offerings one could desire.  Quickly settled on an Italian sub, a bag of salt and vinegar potato chips, and a lemonade.  It was heaven sent.  We sat in a small park next to the restaurant, eating our lunch on the grass, enjoying the sunshine and breeze.  I am still struck by how the hiking experience enables one to appreciate the very simple pleasures that life has to offer.


Lisa picked us up after lunch.  Lisa‘s Hostel is about 2 miles outside of town, and is a several acre property with horses and chickens.  It is a very basic set up here, with no live tv and Wi-Fi only available in the driveway next to the house.   It is a nice set up for a quiet stay.   After getting settled, Lisa took Sub and I to the grocery store where we were able to buy provisions.  I only purchased food for my stay here at the hostel at this point, since I will have another opportunity tomorrow.

My late afternoon was spent organizing my gear and food, and planning my journey.  Next major stop is Port Clinton, about 5 days out if my estimates for daily mileage are reasonable.  The next 150 or so miles are going to be rocky. This section of the trail is infamous for its rockiness.


Speaking of rockiness, I want to report that my feet have been doing very well since Front Royal, Virginia.  What happened in Front Royal is that I changed the socks that I am using, from Smartwool to Darn Tough.  I have been wearing Smartwool for years, and love the comfort and quick drying feature.  But The Smartwool appears to be a two layer construct, and on close inspection, may have caused some rubbing as the layers separated.  The daily grind I put them through may be too much for them.  On the other hand, the Darn Toughs are single layer and made of a different blend.  My feet immediately responded for the better, and the improvement is sustained.  I feel much better about tackling those rocks!","Boiling Springs / Lisa’s Hostel​

This was followed by some ascents and descents, but nothing too extraordinary.  The birds were out in force; I wish I could discern which species had each of the various songs.  It was a symphony.  


Since I was making such good time, I started to reevaluate my plan to target Cove Mountain Shelter.  The town of Duncannon was 4 miles further, and mostly a rocky descent.  There is a hostel there, and rain was now forecasted for the early AM.  This made my decision easy.  I headed for Duncannon where I could get a proper dinner, avoid a wet rock descent in the AM, and be 4 miles further along on my journey.


Duncannon is a depressed little town.  A walk down Main Street evokes sadness, as it is obvious that this was once a very charming place.  The hostel is actually in the back of the outfitter’s shop.  Since I arrived after store hours, the owner texted me a code that enabled me to open the back door, leading into the bunkhouse.  I dropped my bag and planned to walk to the local Dollar General for a couple of items.  The store was about a mile away, outside of town.  It became obvious along the way that the route would be unwalkable due to the narrow, shoulderless high speed road.  So I stuck my thumb out and voila! - I was at DG in less than 3 minutes.  After a 10 minute trip in the store, I walked back to the road and the first car pulled over for me.

But, I am feeling like a caged animal right now. I really want to get back to the trail!


I spent my day cleaning up email, taking care of a couple of personal business items, and updating photos on my trail journal. So if you now look in the photo section you will see a whole lot more than what was there previously. It is high time I got this caught up!

So far, I have not hit the infamous Rocksylvania section of the trail.  I am staying in contact with Blue Jeans and Sub, who are ahead of me. From what I am hearing, I think the toughest sections will be north of Port Clinton, which is a few days out.  We shall see.


I encountered a good number of day hikers today, some in large groups. I did not observe any social distancing, and no masks at all.  This seemed a bit odd to me, because the compliance in Boiling Springs and Duncannon was quite high.  My neck gator mask is serving me well.

I am very happy to report that I had no issues with my shin splint at all today.  So between yesterday (11) and today (18) I have hiked almost 30 miles without issues.   Fortunately, I have not had to hike a steep descent, which is what will really stress test my shins.  Tomorrow will be another 18 mile day, with more elevation changes.   All in all, things are looking good!


One notable event on the trail today was that I had my first encounter with a rattlesnake.  The snake was halfway off the trail as I approached it.  I did not initially see it, but rather heard the telltale rattle first.  After stepping back and recovering from my adrenaline rush, the snake was easy to see... partly because it was big!   I grabbed my phone in order to take a picture, but had to turn it on first.  While it booted up, the rattlesnake slithered into the brush.  I did take a picture of it there, and it is posted.  The photos do not give you a good idea of scale, but the snake was about 4 feet long.  Whew!


As I was unpacking at Rausch Gap, two young ladies who are backpacking for the weekend stopped by to make an early dinner before moving on.  We had a nice chat while they ate.  Then  as they were packing up, they offered me some elk jerky, breakfast bars and a couple of prepared dinners that they said they did not need.  So I am the benefactor of trail magic twice in one day!  Wonders never cease.  And by he way, elk jerky is delicious.  :-)","Peter’s Mountain Shelter​

An alternate route has been set up, and it is about  a half mile longer.  This sounded like a great option to me, so I took it!  However, the alternate route was not blazed, and my Guthook GPS app was not functioning properly either.  So it did cost me some time, as I meander down a few side trails looking for the true alternate route path.  I was excited about coming to the 501 shelter, because it has a reputation of being quite a nice place.  The shelter itself is actually a bunkhouse, with a common area in it. There is a solar shower, and since the shelter is close to a trail head, pizza and Chinese delivery is also available.   On top, there is a caretaker (name is Borderline) who lives 25 yards away from the shelter/bunkhouse.  A potable water supply is available from a faucet on the side of his house.  So it is as nice as some hostels.  However.... the shelter is closed,  and the water is turned off (apparently due to a contamination issue).  The nearest source is a half mile away.  Oh well.  Borderline was very nice, and served me two pieces of cake and two apples.  I think he was grateful that I did not try to convince him to let me stay in the shelter.  Once again, more kindness.","Rausch Gap Shelter​

My acceleration was interrupted when I encountered a pick up truck driving up this trail/road. Turns out the driver was a game warden, who informed me that my 10 miles or so along the ridge were part of the Hamburg Reservoir Watershed area, which is closed by the state of Pennsylvania.  He said police have been issuing $1000 citations to hikers found hiking on the trail in this section.  I was no longer there, and it was not the game warden’s jurisdiction anyway, but he wanted me to be aware and pass the word along.

Water availability in this part of Pennsylvania is scarce, so I stopped at the George Outerbridge Shelter (located next to a spring) 5 miles into my walk in order to replenish for the balance of the day.  I arrived there at about 8:30 in the morning, to find a full house at the shelter. It looks like quite a party had been had there the prior evening.  I even noted that some of the group brought bottled beer with them!  As I continued on down the mountain, I saw that the shelter was only a mile or so away from the parking lot and road.  My guess is that this shelter pretty regularly has a party atmosphere, as it is so accessible.


At the bottom of the mountain was the Lehigh gap. Across the Lehigh River, and was faced with a challenging uphill climb. There were few switchbacks, and the grade was steep.  The last half mile or so, was a boulder climb. This was a “throw your poles up and climb up after them“ kind of climb.  Honestly, it is a challenging climb even without a pack. With a pack it was pretty intense. I was very happy that I was doing this on a clear, dry, morning while I was still fresh.  Following the ascent, one is rewarded with about 2 miles of rock free ridge walking. The reason it is rock free, is that this was a man-made section of trail. It routes around a Superfund site, that is being restored. Bethlehem Steel had a large zinc mining operation here, and the pollution pretty much destroyed this area years ago. The remaining trail for the day was fairly level richer walking, but quite rocky.  Feet are getting sore!

I no I had more than I would need, but I did not want to make that trip a second time.  Besides, it’s nice to have a little extra in case somebody else needed any.  Shortly after I return to the shelter, I was greeted by Carl.  He comes up to the shelter regularly via a nearby access road and drops trail magic for hikers.

Today is a zero, for foot recovery.  Jim and Linell came to visit me and again take me out for a resupply run.      These two have made Pennsylvania so much more bearable.  They have been trail angels thrice over!  I am deeply touched with their kindness and generosity.  We had lunch together at the bakery in town, and it was every bit as delicious as it was yesterday.  (In fact, I had breakfast and dinner there today as well!)


Happily, tomorrow marks another milestone as I enter New Jersey. This will be my eighth state!

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628368,"I was excited to get going today, since I was entering New Jersey.  It is energizing to check off another state, and even more so for Pennsylvania.  The last 50 miles (north of Rte 309) were very tough on one’s feet.  So now I have seven states completed, and over 1300 miles.  That is putting some air in my hiking boots!


My mileage today is lower than I would like for a couple of reasons.  First, I got off to a late start.  I had to wait for the Post Office to open and receive a package from home.  Second, I want to target a destination site that has water available - at least within a mile.  Today I had to target either 13 or 24 miles in order to meet that criteria.  I chose 13.  It turned out to be a good call, because this afternoon was wet, and the terrain was still pretty rocky.  So it was slower going than I expected.  Since I set up early, it will be early to bed and early to rise tomorrow (hopefully).  ","Delaware Water Gap

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628412,"Although I did get to bed early last night, and I did wake up at 5 AM to the sound of the birds, I laid in my tent and just listened to the sounds of the woods, and fell in and out of sleep for another hour and 15 minutes. I can’t imagine anything more pleasant.  So I did not start hiking today until 7:15 AM. That may not sound like a late time, but by the time 5:30AM arrives, it is well lit outside.  Also, if I am going to do a 20+ mile day, I really do need to get on with it early. The terrain here continues to slow one down, and I am finding that a 2 mph average is what to expect, given the level of rockiness.  So far in Jersey, it is not at all as bad as the northwestern Pennsylvania section, but it is enough to slow you down, and your feet do feel it.


Overall, it was an uneventful day. New Jersey is pretty, with bogs, swamps and ponds, and many nice views of small lakes and reservoirs as one walks along the ridges. I came upon a box turtle, and surprised a black snake sunning on one of the rocks.  The snake scurried away before I could get a picture.  It was much skinnier than the rattler I saw in Pennsylvania, but quite long.  I arrived at Culver Lake, just outside of Branchville New Jersey, in the mid afternoon. I was looking forward to a second lunch perhaps, and some cold lemonade at the Sunrise Deli that has developed a good reputation among hikers.  Unfortunately, while the Sunrise Deli is operating, the low traffic has caused the owner to limit his hours of operation based on the business activity.  Apparently I missed the boat by about 15 minutes. (This is the cost of sleeping in!). But I did notice that there was a bait shop up the road, so I decided to take a gamble and walk the extra quarter-mile to see if they may have some drinks.  My efforts were rewarded. I spied a fridge in the back of the store and found a whole rack of lemonade!   I purchased two 16 oz bottles and promptly drank them.  Energized by all the sugar, I finished the remainder of my hike today with an ascent up Sunrise Mountain and a couple mile ridge walk to the Gren Anderson Shelter and tent site.  It looks like I will have it all to myself tonight. Again, I expect a very early night for me. I am quite tired!"," Tent Site, Mile 1309.5

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628441,"Today was a high mile day for me.  George, my trail buddy from GA/NC/TN Invited me to come to his family’s place in the Catskills early next week for a zero day. You may recall George from my earlier adventures. He is a good soul, and I am very happy to reconnect.  I told him that I thought I could make Bear Mountain by Monday, and that would be a good place for us to meet. So I am going to try to make up the miles and stay on plan.


Happily, once I passed High Point, the trail conditions changed dramatically.  I would like to say that the rocks vanished, but they certainly were not as prevalent.  So my pace improved. 


I needed some re-supply items, and Unionville was a good opportunity ahead of me.  I did not arrive until shortly after 5PM.  I bought a hoagie to pack out at the general store, and a couple of resupply items (VERY expensive!!).  I then went to Annabels Pizza, and ordered a slice of pizza. Had I just ordered a regular pizza I think I would’ve been quite satisfied. But I saw that they offered a Chicken Caesar slice, and it looks quite good to me.  So I ordered a slice along with a pint of lemonade (of course).  It turns out that there was a ranch dressing underneath the chicken and Romain on top, that I did not observe when I ordered.   I have to admit that I did not like this one little bit, but I knew I needed the calories so I ate the slice anyway.   Gotta do whatcha gotta do!  Calories are the name of the game!


As I left Unionville, I then hiked a circuitous route to get to the Wallkill wildlife preserve. This was a beautiful marsh, that was in its finest hour here on a beautiful June evening. I hiked all the way around this march with geese, blackbirds, deer, and numerous other unidentified species about me.  I cannot tell you how pretty and serene this whole experience was.


Once out of the preserve, I hiked another mile or two through a bog, on boardwalks (boards nailed to logs laying in the bog), to get to the ascent to the shelter.  It was dusk now, and my legs and feet were tired, but it was not a terribly difficult ascent.  I had to pack in water; I was able to pick some up along the way at a spigot on an abandoned house.  I was all alone at Pochuck. Even though I arrived late, I had a nice evening, and quickly fell asleep as I was pretty tired from the long day.","Gren Anderson

If I only had one day to show someone what hiking can be, this may be it. The first 5 miles were a nice descent through the woods.  Then one enters the Pochuck Boardwalk, a beautiful mile long structure through yet another gorgeous marsh.  The air was filled with birdsong, especially the unique squawk of the blackbirds.  Lots of purple and gold finches as well.  At this point it was midmorning, and it was a bit hot.  Following the boardwalk park area, I came upon Mitches hotdog stand at a trailhead parking lot. What a delightful treat. I had a hot dog with kraut and mustard, a bag of chips and an ice cold Coca-Cola. (Mitch did not carry lemonade.)   Next up was the Stairway to Heaven, a one thousand foot rocky ascent over a mile.  I was impressed with how many locals, including young children, were out tackling this challenge.  After the ascent, one traverses through the woods for several miles, passing a couple brooks and a nice pond.  Stopped for lunch at Wawayanda Shelter, and a few miles later hit the NY border at about 4PM.  Here the topography changed dramatically.  The trail became a series of boulder fields, many of which you simply hike on top, but others requiring serious climbing effort.  This was very fun, but tiring, especially as the day wore on.  At about 7PM, on Rte 17A just 0.1 off trail was the Bellvale Creamery.  Oh my goodness, what an irresistible treat.  The lines were long- after all, it was a beautiful Saturday evening- but the chocolate milkshake and dish of salted caramel ice cream were worth the wait.  I left with a full tummy at 8 PM. I still had another 2 miles to go, with a few more boulder climbs for good measure. Although the sun was setting, I was able to make it into the Wildcat site just as darkness fell.  There were other hikers there, already settled in for the night, but I was able to easily find a nice spot to pitch my tent.  Still full from my ice cream splurge, I did not cook dinner.  But mindful of keeping my calorie intake up, I ate a half dozen cookies with peanut butter slathered on top.  After cleaning up, I was in bed by 10PM.  What a day!","Pochuck Mountain Shelter

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628443,"Today began as yesterday ended, with more boulder climbs.  It seems that almost every ridge had a rock face to it that the trail passed directly through.  Most of these we’re not terrifically high, but they were frequent enough to make the hike reasonably strenuous.  I entered Harriman State Park in afternoon, with much more benign trails.  Harriman is a nice park, with numerous trails.  The biggest challenge for the afternoon was really water availability. While I was not in any serious trouble, I was rationing my two liter supply. I was finding that the water sources identified in my guides (Guthook, Awol) were not reliable.  I arrived at the William Brien site at about 7 PM.  


I had to head down the hill on a yellow blaze trail for about a half a mile to get to a stream in order to re-supply water. I am learning to not get frustrated at the lack of water at shelter sites. Instead by I’ve come to expect a short hike for water to be part of the equation as part of set up. This has been a change that has evolved through the course of my hike so far.  I was spoiled in the southern states, with a very plentiful water supply. Partly because of the season, and partly because of the geography, that’s just that’s not the case and Pennsylvania New Jersey New York so far.

The buds and flowers are especially brilliant in the low, early morning sunshine. Add a good dose of birdsong to that and you have a delicious spring morning!


Bear Mountain was 8 miles away, and I arrived at about 11AM.  Bear Mountain is readily accessible from the NYC metropolitan area.  So the crowds on the trail were the largest I have observed yet, even though it is Monday.  They are here for the stunning views of Manhattan, about 50 miles to the south.  The park area includes Hessian Lake, a scenic attraction.  Picnickers were out in force.  Several folks were fishing.  Families strolling about the promenade.  This was a very nice scene.


George picked me up at the Bear Mountain Bridge.  He was with his high school friend John, and the three of us headed out to George’s family house in the Catskills.  This was almost a 2 hour drive.  Their place is a forty acre piece of paradise, on the West Branch of the Delaware River near Walton.  After going into town to stock up, we were on the banks of the river, fishing by 5 PM.  Sweet.","William Brien Shelter

However, I did hear about possible thunderstorms on the radio in Grandpa’s shuttle.  Sure enough, a light drizzle started before 9AM, and a full scale gusher of a storm came in about 10:15.   Fortunately I was within half an hour of a planned stop at the Appalachian Deli, which is a gas station/ convenience store/deli right on the trail.  I planned to get lunch and a fuel canister there.  I was able to do this but given that it was raining cats and dogs outside, I had no choice but to eat out by the gas pumps, where the only cover was available.  No one seemed to take notice of me as they came and went. My guess is I was not the first person to do this.  After about 45 minutes, the range subsided, and I was on my way.  Within an hour Act 2 of the storm front came in, and it was more intense and prolonged than Act 1.  Apart from slowing me down, the rain did not bother me at all.

Several sections had wild fescue growing as groundcover, giving the forest an electric green hue reminiscent of what I saw in the Smokies and the forest just north of Beauty Spot.  I enjoyed the boulder hopping and rockclimbing.  It was more strenuous than I had anticipated, especially the rock climbing. As for the trail, there was a lot of elevation change.  Although the ascents were relatively short, they were steep and often required high steps to reach footholds.  Really gave the quads a workout!  Thank goodness for the great weather over the past week.  The climbing would have been awful when wet. 


My original target today was the Wiley Shelter.

Salisbury is a postcard perfect little New England village in northwest Connecticut.  I learned from Vanessa that Meryl Streep and Jane Curtin live here.  I can understand why.  One immediately is calmed by the pace, and the serenity of the village.  Cars still stop at crosswalks, people smile and greet you, and all the kids are above average.  Okay, I am getting carried away.  But one cannot help but feel relaxed and welcome here.

Greylock has a reputation for being quite muddy, but given the dry weather of the last few weeks, this was not the case.  Interestingly, on the descent down the north west face, the air was a little cooler.

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628871,"Last night was unexpectedly wet.  The rain started as I pitched my tent.  I initially thought it was a transient shower, and it was.  However, several other showers followed, and it became a full fledged storm by 9PM.  I was up later than planned since I was hunkered down at the shelter waiting for the rain to let up.  I let myself sleep in until 6:30AM, and was on the trail by 7:45AM.


Even though the rain stopped about 1AM, the trail was moist, and the rocks -which are plentiful- were slippery.  Given my late start and somewhat slower pace, I decided not to push on to my original target -Goddard Shelter- today.  It is another 8.5 miles, which is do-able, but it would set me up for a late arrival.   I am not trying to keep any appointments, so that seemed pointless to me.  So I am setting up camp here at 4PM.  Hopefully I can make this an early night.  Rain is in the forecast tomorrow, starting in the afternoon.  An early start would be desirable.","Seth Warner Shelter​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628872,"It was a gray morning with still air. Fortunately it was cooler, perhaps in the upper 60’s, so bug activity was minimal.  Rain showers started at 11AM, and continued often on through the rest of the day.  Today included a couple of reasonably significant ascents/descents, and the terrain was pretty rocky.  Also, I walked by several beaver ponds, and was impressed by their size.  I am sorry to say I have not yet spotted a beaver, though.  Overall, considering the wet rocks,  I was pretty happy with my mileage over about 9 hours.


One other point worth mentioning about the trail in Vermont so far, is the mud. Vermont has a reputation for muddy trails particularly in the spring, and I can see evidence of that in many places.  Given the dry weather we have been having, the mud has been minimal. You can see where the muddy patches were, as the ground is black and covered with boot prints.  Or there are boardwalks set up.  But every so often, you may put your foot down on one of these patches, and there is no solid ground beneath you. The black mud just absorbs your foot like quicksand.  This is another reason I am very happy to be wearing boots, rather than trail runners. I came upon another through hiker (Jello) this morning to find him on his knees reaching down into a hole to recover his shoe which was deep in the mud.  I would expect this to be a relatively common occurrence in the (wet) Spring.


I successfully pitched my tent in between showers this evening, and am secure in it now- no more getting stuck in the shelter waiting for the rain to subside.  There must be a dozen mosquitoes bouncing around between the fly and the tent; I suppose they are looking for relief from the rain as well.  Speaking of mosquitoes, it’s a little odd to me that I have experienced quite a bit of mosquito activity, but I have had very few bites.  This has not been the case for me in the past, so I cannot offer an explanation.  For now, this is one more thing to be thankful for!"," Melville Nauheim Shelter​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628873,"Despite the rain- or perhaps because of it- there were several late arrivals at the Story Spring Site last night.   I was awakened by conversation from another tent at 4:30AM.  (Go figure. It’s Saturday night!) When I got up myself at 5:30AM, I was surprised to see multiple tents around me that were not there when I turned in.  While not unheard of, this is not typical through hiker behavior. Later arrivals tend to be weekend hikers who may be a little less experienced, or are not part of the early riser set.
 The rain had stopped when I arose, allowing me to pack up without a hassle. Like yesterday, the rain did not bring cool, fresh air behind it.  The air was damp and still; it was evident that more rain was on the way. I was on the trail before 7AM, and the precipitation started shortly thereafter.  It was a drizzle, and stayed with me all morning, as I ascended Stratton Mountain.  The moisture did slow me down, as the ascent was reasonably rocky.  Unfortunately, there was no view to be had from the fire tower at the summit.  However, there was a mountain spring up there that produces some delightful water- so much so that I dumped what I had and refilled everything.  I was not going to worry about the weight- this water was too good to pass up.  I have really developed a fondness for fresh sparkling spring water. There are a few places that stand out in my mind for water flavor and freshness  – North Carolina just above the Smokies, the South Wilcox spring, and of course this spring at the Stratton summit.


The Story Spring Shelter is actually a cabin, outfitted with windows, a sliding door, and a wood stove.  (This is the first wood stove I have seen on the trail.)  This is a well kept place.  It is situated on a beautiful site, with a spring 20 yards away, and is very secluded.  Given the lack of bug activity this evening, and the forecast for rain tonight, I chose to sleep in the shelter.","Story Spring Shelter​

The people here are exceptionally hospitable.


Shortly after my arrival, I received very bad news.  My brother, who I just visited last week, passed away.  He had been quite sick.  I will spare the details here, other than to say we all thought he had more time.  In this sense, my decision to stay at the Pinnacle was serendipitous.  I was able to make all of the phone calls I needed to, and sort the situation out.  My plan is to hike to Hanover, then return home to be with family in the middle of next week.  I will zero again tomorrow to do some planning, and recenter myself.","Spruce Peak Shelter

My thoughts of possibly doing a 20 mile day were extinguished when Half Baked informed me that he had made a connection with  trail angel through Facebook.  Jessica would meet us at VT 103, just by the Clarendon Gorge.  The trail magic exceeded my wildest dreams.  Fresh cherries, strawberries, watermelon, sushi (really!), cheese, carrots, Italian grinders, and of course beer, wine coolers, and kombucha.  Oh, let’s not forget chocolate and maple candy.  Jessica also gave us her phone number and let us know she was ready to shuttle us as needed anywhere between Rutland and Hanover.  Jessica said this was her first experience as a trail angel, and that she was motivated by her dream to hike the AT herself, possibly next year.  What an incredible treat.  I am blown away by  Jessica’s kindness.


Following this amazing meal, I still had a two mile hike to the Clarendon site.  This last section was no joke, with a steep climb up a rock face.  Clarendon is a very nice site, with an open field in front, and a nice brook to the side.  And unbelievably, there was more magic there- a cooler full of beer.  Yes, when it rains, it pours.","Little Rock Pond

span class=""Apple-converted-space""> The grade was reasonably mild at 500ft per mile.  However,  unforecasted rain showers slowed me down a bit.  I took an hour break in the late AM when I arrived at Governor Clement Shelter just as the rain shower morphed into a downpour.


I arrived at Cooper Shelter at 2PM.  The rain had stopped and it was hazy, but the sun was warming things up.  While there were still plenty of clouds to the west, it looked like we may have a sustained break from the rain.  There is a 0.25 mile spur trail that runs up to the summit.  I dropped my pack, grabbed my poles and headed up.   The spur trail was very steep and rocky.  I was glad I brought my poles.  The views from the top of Killington were great, but foggy/hazy skies limited the view.  The gondola was operating (free of charge) so I thought about taking a ride, while I headed to the restaurant.  Just as I sat down with my burger and lemonade, the skies opened up again for a sustained downpour.  This made the gondola decision easy for me.   My aim was to avoid the rocky descent in the rain, and the storm patterns were clearly continuing.  So I waited for the next break in the rain to head back to the shelter.


Cooper Lodge is an old stone building that is in need of repair.  It sits on the west facing slope of Killington Mountain, and has large windows overlooking the vista to the west.  Fortunately, the weather did clear up before sundown and those of us in the shelter were treated to a fabulous sunset.  Nice day.","Clarendon Shelter​

Today was a planned short day, because the Inn at Long Trail has a great reputation as a place to stay.

For the first time, the bugs developed a taste for me.  As I walked along Kent Pond (around 9AM), their feasting began.  Thankfully, my stash of Picardin did the trick, at least as far as the biting went.  They still circled my head like WWI fighters, looking for an opening.  As I distanced myself from the pond, the activity level lessened, but there was aggressive bug traffic periodically, all day long.  The trail itself was benign today, with not much rock or roots.  There was a fair amount of elevation change, but nothing too dramatic.   
I spotted some scat on several occasions that I am guessing may be moose, but no moose siting yet.  Fingers crossed!  However, I have been told by hikers from the area that moose are aggressive and will charge people, unprovoked.  They say to get behind a tree once you spot a moose. Their turning radius is wide, so getting behind a tree is your defense in the event they charge.   Every local I spoke with said they would rather be confronted by a bear rather than a moose.  I still want to see a moose.

Today was a little on the hot side, and although the train was kind, I was not able to get into a good groove today.   I am breaking in a new pair of boots, so that may explain why my feet are a little sore. But even discounting that, the 16 or so miles and I did felt more like 26. As it is, I hIked from 9:30AM this morning, to 6:30PM tonight.

Pretty challenging- I am feeling it in my shoulders right now.  


Technically,  Kinsman is two 4K foot mountains- South and North.  There is enough separation between the two peaks - about a mile- to classify them as separate mountains.  The gap between them only drops about 300 feet.  But suffice it to say, it was crazy rocky the whole way.  So I’ll take the credit for two more NH 4K footers.

This section was about 3 miles long.  I am sure I slowed up a bit here, as I stopped to take pictures of Mt. Lincoln and Mt. Lafayette. 


There are several reasons to love the alpine zone. First, the jaw dropping views are almost continuous as you are walking a ridge with 360 degree visibility.  Second the winds are amazing.  They are stiff and consistent, but not overpowering.  I felt cleansed by the clean air.  Lastly, the flora is beautiful.  There are fine grasses throughout, punctuated with many varieties of wildflowers nestled in the rock outcroppings.  


The exposure, which leads to these attributes, also means that conditions can change for the worse very rapidly. Although I do not know all the details, Mango (hiker friend from earlier in my journey who is ahead of me) got caught in an unexpected storm near Mt.

After descending, I arrived at Zealand Falls which has a nice AMC Hut that was serving burritos, quesadillas, drinks, snacks and baked goods.  It was very nice to have a hot pork burrito for a late lunch.  After that, I went over to the falls where I could sit on the warm sun soaked rocks and soak my feet for a while in the cold running water..  What luxury!  I remain so impressed with how much pleasure I  am able to receive from simple things.

I knew today was going to be less ambitious, mileage-wise, as I set my target for Mizpah Hut / Nauman Tentsite.  From there, I am well positioned for the Presidential Traverse, including ascents of Mt.Washington and Mt. Madison.

Mount Washington is an iconic waypoint on this hike.  It was enveloped in fast moving clouds when I arrived, so there was not much in the way of views, but the environment was surreal.  In between the banks of fast moving fog you would occasionally see the sun and bright blue sky for a brief time.  It was very dynamic, and was like a light show.
The final chapter of the hike was the ascent and descent of Mount Madison.  Like many of the Presidential peaks, Madison is a pile of boulders.  The hike up was short, at just over a half mile, but steep.  The 3.5 mile descent was as steep, but included a lot of unstable rocks on the section above tree line.  Below tree line, the trail was narrow, still rocky, and had multiple blow downs.  In short, it was a lot of work to end the day.
The Osgood site includes five tent platforms that could handle two tents each.  I felt fortunate to get a platform spot when I arrived at 8PM.  There really was no other option beyond the platforms, as the site is very rocky.  Exhausted, I had a few peanut butter cookies topped with peanut butter, a cup of herbal tea followed by a Jack Daniels miniature, and went to sleep.  I do not remember putting my head down.","Mizpah Hut /Nauman Tentsite​

The balance of the downstairs space is a common area and kitchen.  I chose to sleep in one of the stalls.  Since most folks are in bed early anyway, this was a much quieter, more private option.


As the day progressed I realized how tired my legs really were from the last several days in the Whites.  I also noted the forecast tomorrow is for thunderstorms.  I have Wildcat Mountain ahead of me; Wildcat is known for its challenging rock climbs.  So, case closed- tomorrow will be a zero.  Several of my hiker friends have made the same decision, so it will be a social day tomorrow.","Osgood Tentsite

It is nice to see more hiker activity on the trail.  Southbound hikers (SOBOs) started on or after July 1 for the most part, since that is when Baxter State Park opened.  I am starting to run into them now, and expect to see more SOBOs as I continue north.  When a NOBO and SOBO meet, there is a lot of information to share.  Everyone has a good time picking each other’s brains.  I find that the most useful info is that concerning resupply and hostel/ hotel options.  I am learning to stay away from asking about trail conditions because this is such a subjective area.  Everyone has an opinion about each mountain, and they often are quite different. It also is not especially good for your mindset when someone characterizes an ascent or descent as “utter hell”.   I have found that everything is do-able and fun if you maintain the right mindset, and have reasonable mileage expectations.  However, this is easier said than done.","Libby House

The hike today began with a traverse of the Notch, also known as the Mahoosuc Mile. Many say this is the most difficult mile of the AT.  There is no hiking through this stretch.  It is a boulder scramble all the way.  I had to remove my pack three times in order to squeeze through spaces between boulders. The fast hikers can make it through in an hour.  I did it in two hours.  I have to say that while it was very challenging, it was fun.  Immediately following the Notch, one ascends the Arm.  This is a two thousand foot ascent in 1.5 miles.  There were plenty of smooth rock faces to climb on the way up.  This was then followed by a second ascent up Old Speck Mountain.  All in all, I got pretty banged up through this experience.

Today was yet another beautiful day for hiking.  Sunny with puffy clouds, low humidity, temps in the low 80s.  Few bugs.  I ascended the Baldpates (West and East), and the views from both summits were stunning.  Their mostly granite caps make them seem like balds; in any event we are talking about interesting flora interspersed around the rocks, and 360 degree views.  These are similar to those in the Whites, but the flora and the rock itself are both quite different.  Parts of descents were slow, with steep/rocky/rooty and often slippery sections.  But overall, I was able to put up a decent pace (1.4 mph) versus what I have been doing since I entered New Hampshire.

As part of my day today, I  assembled a list of trail mantras I have heard throughout my journey.  I thought it would be a good idea to capture them, and what they mean to me.  These are probably familiar to many.  I am sure that each of us will have our own take.  My take on them follows.


Hike your own hike.This is the most common mantra you will hear on the trail. It has become cliche, but it really is a great principle to follow.  It drives one to hike within their own capability, and to maximize their enjoyment of the trail.  It puts the burden of determining what your AT experience will be on yourself, which is as it should be.




The trail provides.
Kindness, culture, deep immersion in nature, opportunities to reflect, fabulous views, and blueberries.  Yes, the trail provides.


Take what the trail gives you.
The trail is going to be what it is, regardless of how you feel about it. One cannot wish a rock climb away, or let a false summit bother you.  And on the other hand, this mantra speaks to the fact that you will experience things on the trail that you cannot experience anywhere else. So enjoy the moment!


Embrace the suck.
Difficult times are inevitable on the trail. If we do not embrace the bad along with the good, your trail experience will be much diminished.  I personally try to take bad conditions on as a challenge.  That said, I will not put myself in terrible conditions if I have acceptable options available.


No pain, no rain, no Maine.
Related to the above. One cannot expect to do this hike without accepting challenges.


We’re all here because we’re not all there. 
Everybody is out here for a reason. We are all trying to fulfill ourselves in one way or another.


Smiles not miles.

This speaks to staying centered on while you are out here. It is very easy to get into mile counting, and to seek big days. This is understandable, as it is something to be proud of. But it all needs to fall within the boundaries of being enjoyable.Ounces are pounds and pounds are pain.This speaks to the fact that one needs to be very choicelful about every item to carry in their pack. On the surface any additional item can seem like a small additional load to carry.

He will not be returning to the trail anytime soon, I suspect.  In addition to being saddened, this has caused me to refocus on hiking safely, and to take my time.","ME Rte 15 / Shaw’s Hostel​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630167,"I awoke to the sound of rain this morning.  This was not a surprise.  With today planned at 11 miles over most of the Chairbacks, I was estimating 8 hours - maybe even a bit on the high end.  So I rolled over and took an extra snooze. 


I was on the trail at 8AM, under cloudy, threatening skies.  There was no doubt that more rain was coming.  The only question was when.  The hike started with a 2K foot ascent over 3 miles, to summit Barren Mountain. This was followed by three additional peaks over the next eight miles.  So there was a lot of ascending and descending throughout the day on rocky trail.  And it was wet, with a few brief showers in the morning, and a thunderstorm in the mid afternoon.  I took my time, being very conscious of the conditions.  I am happy to say that while I did incur several slips, there were no falls.


I ran into Tailspin at the water source for the  Chairback site.  I first met Tailspin just north of Pearisburg this spring.  She was hiking southbound at the time (Harpers Ferry to Springer) and flip flopped back to Harpers Ferry to complete her hike northbound.  Tailspin is in her 20s, from my home state of Maryland.  I ran into her in Monson, at Shaw’s and it was nice to catch up.  Unfortunately, at this meeting, I learned that Tailspin fell and sustained a bad contusion on her knee.  She is a strong hiker, and needs to finish by this Sunday since she has to be in school on Monday.  She was pressing on, with another five miles planned.  This makes three reminders in three days of how dangerous the trail can be.","Long Pond Stream Lean-to​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630168,"Today has been delightful.  With the storm system past us, cool, dryer air is moving in.  Temperatures were noticeably cooler last night- I suspect low 50’s. Today is a sunny, breezy day in the mid to high 60’s.


Knowing I had a short day planned, I slept in again this morning.  I was on the trail at 8:15.  After ascending Chairback Mountain, I descended to   the West Branch Pleasant River.  The descent started with a short, but technical boulder scramble.  The balance of the descent was quite manageable, with only a few precarious sections.  I should say that I am being extremely cautious on these descents.  I had to ford the river, which my feet very much appreciated.  I’ve come to appreciate this benefit from fording.  I can feel the effects of the cool soak for at least an hour afterward. The ascent up to the Carl Newhall site was very easy, with a gentle grade and few roots or rocks.  The site itself was well maintained, and situated near a brook that feeds the Pleasant River below. Toucan and OMG also arrived here early, so we decided to make a fire.  It will be early to bed tonight, for tomorrow will be a big day.","Chairback Gap Lean-to​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630169,"I started very early today -5AM- ,in order to insure a timely arrival to a rendezvous point 16 miles out. This Is a planned food replenishment, courtesy of Shaw’s.  The meeting was planned for 4PM.  Given I had to summit and descend a few mountains, I wanted to leave plenty of time.  I joined in with Toucan and OMG for the resupply run, so actually only one of us had to be there at 4PM.  But all of us wanted to be there so we did. It hold anyone else up.


As it turns out, the terrain was benign.  I summited White Cap, the last of four peaks, at 8:30AM.  White Cap is the last mountain of any consequence on the AT before Katahdin, about 70 miles north.    The killer view of Katahdin was not to be had, however, due to fog.  It was quite windy, so I was tempted to wait and see how long it would take to blow over.  But the clock was ticking, and there was no cover.  About 15 minutes into my descent I saw the sun breaking through.  And then I came upon a ledge with a lookout point.  I had my view!  It was an impressive site to see.  Katahdin stands alone as a massive outcropping in the landscape. It is imposing and beautiful.


 The descent down White Cap did not pose any significant challenges.  
I did see Tailspin again, at the Logan Brook site.  I was surprised to see her here at this hour, since she was on a schedule.  Sadly, she was coming off the trail, and will take a shuttle to Baxter, where she hopes to summit Katahdin this weekend.  This is yet another poignant reminder of how tenuous our thru hikes are.


I made it to the resupply point an hour ahead of schedule.  Poet -who along with his wife, Hippie Chick -runs Shaw’s arrived 15 minutes early with the resupply and a bonus cold beer for each of us.  Since I had only three miles of flat terrain ahead to get to my target site, I gladly accepted!


Cooper Brook Falls is a very nice site.  The shelter is right on the  brook, which is substantial in size.  There is a waterfall and the largest swimming hole I have seen on the trail.  Toucan took advantage of this, but it was a bit cool outside for me to participate.","Carl Newhall Lean-to​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630170,"A rainy morning delayed my start until 9AM.  It was a wet day today, but the trail was easy, with little elevation change, and moderate roots/rocks.  I expected the weather to clear up at mid-day, but it remained drizzly and threatening.  At 4PM, more significant rain started just as I was approaching the Nahmakanta site.  I stopped for cover, and to assess my options.  I had six miles to my target, and another big day tomorrow. Bottom line, stopping now will likely cost me another day, but reduces the “grind factor” immensely.  I would not need to set an aggressive target tomorrow.  Smiles, not miles.  So here I am, setting up and planning for an early night.  I will play tomorrow by ear, but likely will end up summiting Katahdin on Tuesday, rather than Monday.","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630173,"Having internalized my new game plan, I took it down a notch this morning, sleeping in until 6:30AM.  The decision to sleep late was made  easier by a poor night’s rest, caused by a very restless shelter companion.  Advantage, tenting.


So it was off to the trail at 8:15AM.  Walking around several ponds/lakes, listening to the occasional loon, made for a great morning.  It ended in spectacular fashion on the summit of Nesuntabunt.  There you get a superb look at Katahdin, just 17 miles away, as the crow flies. The afternoon hike was equally pleasant, but included walks along several brooks and streams.  It has been a sunny, breezy day that never felt hot. You could not ask for nicer weather. What a hike!


I have to comment that the Maine wilderness is pretty amazing.  There is so much water around,  making every twist and turn in the trail an event, as there seems to be something new at every turn.  I understand from other hikers that the fishing here is beyond outstanding. I think it could be fun to come back and do this stretch again, but with fishing gear next time!


I rolled in to the Rainbow Stream site about 5:00PM.  So about 14 miles in  9 hours.  Hmmph.  This is a slower pace than I had anticipated.  I should mention that while I would describe trail conditions as moderately rooty and rocky they do slow you down, especially with the moisture left from yesterday’s showers.  And I have to admit, I do feel the effects on my feet.  This validates the decision to take the mileage down and add a day to the plan.  Smiles, not miles!","Nahmakanta Stream Lean-to​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630174,"Today’s hike was very much like yesterday, but with more roots and rocks.  My pace was similar to yesterday.  When I summited the very last peak prior to Katahdin (Rainbow Ledges), I had cell service available.  Checking the weather, I could see that thunderstorms are predicted for Tuesday.  This does not bode well for summiting Katahdin.  In fact, it is possible that the folks at Baxter State Park will close access in the face of such a forecast.  I considered my options at the Abol Bridge Campground, And decided to take a zero day tomorrow in Millinocket, and heading to the Birches on Tuesday ( in the rain), setting me up to summit on Wednesday.  Wednesday is expected to be a beautiful day, as the storm system moves out.  While I am eager and excited to finish, after 180+ days, I think it is worth my while to wait for a pretty day.


Abol Bridge campground is a busy spot.   It sits right on a wide river connecting some of the numerous ponds and lakes in the area.  This is a destination location for visitors to camp and canoe/kayak/raft/fish.  This made it an easy task to hitch into Millinocket.  In fact, I was simply standing on the side of the road looking at my phone, when a young couple walked up as they were approaching their car, and asked if I needed a ride.  More kindness!
The Appalachian Trail Lodge is a nice enough place, run by the parents of Hippie Chick from Shaw's. The property is not really set up for multi-day stays (i.e. no larger common areas, fire rings, etc.), as the large majority of hikers are on their way back to civilization after completing their hikes.  They are very much into the shuttle business, between Millinocket/Katahdin (20+ miles) and Millinocket / Bangor (70+ miles).  ","Rainbow Stream Lean-to​

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630293,"This is my first zero that I really did not want to take.  I am certain I made the right choice, but I am keen to summit.  I feel like a caged animal.   That aside, I was able to use the day productively.  I edited my last week of journal entries and posted them, and made a few calls.
About 4PM, Always & Sunny and Toucan arrived from summiting Katahdin.  The weather today worked out, although it was not sunny.  For Always and Sunny, this was the end of their hike.  (Toucan is section hiking.)   Surprisingly, they both said that finishing the trail was not an emotional event for them.  I am thinking that this may relate to the fact that they are immediately starting a cross country cycling trip.  They have a lot on their minds, and a lot to do. ","Abol Bridge/ Appalachian Trail Lodge

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630294,"As expected, this morning was wet.  Several thunderstorms blew through.  I counted my blessings for first making a good decision to delay summiting to tomorrow, and second for the benign trail conditions that made hiking in the downpour quite manageable.  All in all, the 10 mile hike moved along nicely.
I arrived at Katahdin Stream Campground in the early afternoon, whereupon I registered with Kevin, the Ranger on duty.  I was assigned #100, meaning I will be  the one hundredth thru hiker to complete their hike at Katahdin this year.  Kevin is a nice man, and provided advice regarding trail layouts, water sources, and the Birches campsite.   Kevin encouraged folks to slack pack.  The Rangers will hold your pack and even provide a day pack to help make this decision easy.   I plan to hike with my backpack.  I have not slack packed a single mile on the trail, and would prefer not to start now.
Eleven hikers were signed up to stay at the Birches.  Everyone had come in from Abol Bridge campground - or Millinocket, like myself- so the site was filled by mid-afternoon. Excitement filled the air, of course.  An early fire was built, and we spent hours around the fire together talking about our hikes and planning for the day tomorrow.","Abol Bridge/ Appalachian Trail Lodge

Rodof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630295,"Although I slept well, I awoke at 4:00AM.  We had a cool night, as the storm system moved out.  I could hear the wind howling in the trees above, reminiscent of the winter storms in Georgia.  I have zero interest in hiking in the dark, so I laid there, semi-conscious, for the next 90 minutes.  I likely drifted in and out, enjoying the meditative experience one last time- on this journey, at least.
I was up at 5:30AM; by 6AM everyone was active. Spirits were high, evidenced by the light chatter among everyone. I was feeling several different emotions simultaneously.  Of course there was the excitement of completing the journey and checking the box.  This was mixed with a cocktail of sadness and nervousness about finishing.  After all, I have been living this simple, removed life for six months. And then there was the anticipation of what Katahdin would be like.  I was eager to get moving.
Katahdin was no joke.  The AT is defined by the Hunt Trail.  You can think of the ascent as having three defined sections.  The bottom section, below treelike, was not difficult.  The middle section of the ascent was a “put your poles away” rock climb.  My hand injury plagued me here, as my ability to grip- even a finger hold- is still compromised.  The wind made the climb that much more challenging.  We were seeing 40-50-mph winds above tree line, which is enough to move you around if you get surprised by a gust. This made the top section- primarily boulder hopping- more exciting than it needed to be. And yes, doing this with my backpack made it more difficult.
Summiting Katahdin was exhilarating.  It is a magnificent mountain, and the views are outstanding.  There is a Knife Edge Trail that would be a thrill to hike someday - without the wind, please.  There is also a basin, featuring Chimney Pond.  All to say there is a lot to explore here.  What a beautiful place.
As for my feelings at the finish, I was of course excited and fired up.  But honestly, I knew I had a challenging descent ahead of me; there was more work to do.  I wanted to stay focused.
My descent down the Abol Trail was slow and technical. It was not easy, but much more accomodating than the Hunt Trail.  All in all, my summit round trip took about eight hours.
From the Abol Campground, I had a roughly 20 mile trip to Millinocket.  I was able to hitch a ride out with the third car that came by.  Sam, a thirty something lady, had done a day hike up Katahdin. and was on her way back home, about 50 miles away. So by 4:00PM, I was back at the Appalachian Trail Lodge.  ","The Birches
