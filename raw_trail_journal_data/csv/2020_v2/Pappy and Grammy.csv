Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625060,Pulled all of our items out and weighed them to verify our total weight.  Looking at a Zpacks Triplex Tent but not sure if the tent sites are big enough so am watching some video logs of others to check size.  We currently use a Big Agnes Copper Spur UL3 and do love it for space and ease of setup.  I was surprised to see that throwing everything in the pack and then weighing the pack came out nearly the same.  Snowy day here so this and working out help.,,View Entry,"Nov 29, Fri",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625061,We are planning a section hike of the Shenandoah National Park in August of 2020.  Had a terrific hike from mid Mass to mid Vermont last summer.  Some stiff mountains in that section and lots of mud.  We are planning a night at one of the lodges so should be fun.  We would like to do the entire park but will have to check our schedules and see what we can do per day.  We usually average about 12 miles per day with neros and zeroes.,,View Entry,"Nov 29, Fri",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625452,"We have asked our Grandson if he wanted to hike the AT with us this summer.  First I laid out the physical challenge and the potential hazards.  He said he really wanted to go, bears or no bears.  So we have started to accumulate some gear for him.  He will be 12 when we hike but he is very tall and in good shape.  He has hiked part of the long trail so he knows what to expect.  Found some good deals at ULA, Hammock Gear, and REI.  He hikes with us locally and he has camped with us many times.  He will be sporting an Ohm pack from ULA and an HG Burrow top quilt.  He loves to hammock so that too.",,View Entry,"Dec 27, Fri",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626041,"We have made our reservations at Stanimals for our prehike stay.  Numerous hikers gave positive reviews so we are excited.  We will be bringing our 12 year-old Grandson along, he is an experienced hiker and camper.  Other planning is happening such as securing his gear and clothes.  Training on bears and snakes and the dreaded mouse.  We took up snowshoeing as a way to help prepare our legs for winter and are really enjoying it.Jack will tote a ULA Ohm so we all will be carrying ULA packs.  I will have my Dutchware Chameleon hammock and Grammy and Jack in the Copper Spur HV UL3.  We are purchasing some food now such as Packit Gourmet Dotties Chicken Noodle, Shepherds Pie, and Texas State Fair Chicken.  Also love us some Trailtopia Berry Cobbler and their Beer Braised Chicken Stew.  Watching lots of trail videos for that area.  I get misty eyed watching Sam I Am and Loner as they were the first two who got me started on hiking, also Redbeard.   Now I watch Early Riser, Sunset and Chica, Dixie and all the rest.  We got started with all of this when we stayed the night at Delaware Water Gap and stumbled on to the trail.  Then we did a bit of the Long Trail, the next thing you know......The hardest part of the entire process is leaving things behind.  We love our Helinox Chair, and other gadgets such as umbrella, isobutane insect shield, Hummingbird hammock as a chair, radio, etc..  When we do the Boundary Waters Canoe Area we bring everything!",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Sat",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627548,We still have plans to hike from Waynesboro to near the end of the SNP in mid August.  We hear lots of good and bad news but we continue to work out by doing practice hikes and exercising.  Our hope is it will happen as we are taking our grandson this year and we know he would love it.  He hiked in Vermont with us and did very well.  I know many are in this same boat and we wish you all well.,,View Entry,"Apr 06, Mon",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628834,Very sad to say that we will have to call off our AT section hike this year as we were going to hike with Grandson in the Shenandoah NP.  I would rather save it for next summer.  Instead we are going to do a section of the Superior Hiking Trail.  Next summer you will see us on the AT as we would not want to miss it!,,View Entry,"Jun 28, Sun",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628868,We will be hiking from Oberg Mtn to Caribou River this August on what would have been our Appalachian Trail hike.  Had to cancel the AT due to bringing our grandson and the Covid 19 in the AT area where we were to hike.  This will be spectacular for him as the views of Lake Superior and Temperance River is truly amazing.  Working out the details now.,,View Entry,"Jun 30, Tue",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630676,We had planned to do the Shenandoah National Park but with Iowa being such a hot spot and not wanting to carry any 'bugs' to Virginia we altered our plans to hike the Superior Hiking Trail.  Our grandson Jack was very excited to hike and we did not want to disappoint.  He loved it though was always anxious to reach camp.,,View Entry,"Sep 16, Wed",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630677,"Next year we are going to hike the AT we hope now the prep begins.  One thing about section hiking you are always working out, every year.  This photo shows the amazing views we had from the trail of Lake Superior.",,View Entry,"Sep 16, Wed",0
