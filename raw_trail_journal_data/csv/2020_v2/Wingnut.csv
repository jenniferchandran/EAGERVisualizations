Wingnut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626238,"So…I guess you could say I’ve been hiking since before I could walk, if that makes any sense.
My Dad and Mom were passionate lovers of the outdoors dating back to their courtship and marriage in the ‘40s.  When I came along in 1952, well, there was no reason not to bring me along.   (Yup, that’s me in the ‘ultralight’ pack-basket.)
We did most of our hiking and camping in the Adirondacks.  Dad was one of the early 46ers (#303) and I followed a couple of years later completing mine in 1967 (#439).  Not unlike many who hike the AT, it was my Father who introduced me to the trail.  In fact, we covered the 20 miles needed for my Boy Scout Hiking Merit Badge on the AT in Vermont.
But life became busy and I stepped away from anything but day hikes for several decades.
I had the good fortune to be appointed to West Point and was commissioned into the Infantry in 1974.  I had a wonderful, happy, lucky 30-year career serving mostly in Ranger, Light and Parachute Infantry outfits and traveling the world to places as varied as England, Panama, Hawaii, Mongolia and Iraq.  It was in The Islands that I picked up my trail name, then my surfing nickname, of ‘Wingnut.’  (See ‘Endless Summer 2’ for explanation; I am the antithesis of the hero…) 
When I retired in 2004, I joined the world of Information Technology and spent 5 years at Oracle with a terrific set of teammates.  I returned to Government Service in the Intelligence Community for several years before joining NetApp, a company and colleagues that I truly love and admire.  I’ve been there since 2011.
In 2014, the absolutely awesome Dr. Liz Cross (Trail Name ‘FoxGirl’) and I married after a 4-year courtship during which we began to hike regularly.  Indeed, our wedding took place at Skyland on the Skyline Drive just off the AT.  Our long hikes began soon after.
We hiked over 100 mi on The Long Trail in 2015, did a 500 mi AT section in 2016, took a steam train to access a remote section of the Colorado Trail in 2017, did the Tour de Mont Blanc  in 2018 (ok…there we ‘glamped’ in hotels every night…), and, finally, in 2019 we hiked the fabulous Wonderland Trail around Mount Rainier. 
Despite all those experiences, Liz and I know this summer’s 6 month AT thru-hike attempt will be significantly more challenging both physically and mentally.  Accordingly, we have chosen to share the journey in a way that will enable us to remain in close touch and optimize our chances for success.  Details in next post",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Sun",0
Wingnut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626407,"Clearly, Liz and I have thought about this quite a bit; for years, actually. 
We are well aware that the thru-hike completion rate is about 25%, probably somewhat less amongst older hikers. Additionally, we both harbor some nagging ailments and our long section hike in ’16 ended with me in hospital for a week or so with stomach ulcers from those diabolical h. pylori bacteria. As a result, this time we want to slow down, think this through, and do it right.
Liz is a writer and a poet who savors solitude and loves to hike but does not have a particular passion to thru-hike 2200 miles. We are both most comfortable in the woods and very much look forward to simplifying our lives. But we did not want to spend the many months apart a classic full AT hike would entail.  Fortunately, being, um, ‘seniors,’ we had options.
So, we decided to conduct parallel but joined AT adventures; Liz and our delightful 3-yr old pup Lola, operating from our Jeep and towing the modest 13’ Scamp trailer we acquired, will write, take daily walks, and generally keep pace with my hike.  This will allow us to have our own experiences but also to talk often, see one another frequently, share friends and trail comrades, host visitors, and take ‘zero’ days together to resupply, reflect, and plan in towns along the trail.  
(Those who grew up in the Army or Marine Corps, will recognize that the Jeep and Trailer serve as our combination TOC (Tactical Operations Center) and Combat Trains.)
Okay, so given that strategy and the fact that this hike will actually be more challenging mentally and emotionally than physically, why do I want to do this?  I’ve worked it down to these 5 reasons:
1. To grow my relationship with Liz through the shared stress of collaboratively planning and executing a very difficult adventure (…Liz is laughing as she reads this over my shoulder!)

2. To learn self-reliance and live simply and deliberately

3. To learn to value solitude as the key to fully engaging nature

4. To become wiser, healthier, happier, and kinder

5. To become one with my pack 
That’s it for this entry.  Next, our low-tech method for planning a complex endeavor.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Mon",0
Wingnut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626410,"To be honest, planning the actual execution of a long hike is not really all that hard; there are guiding resources aplenty to help one prepare. 
But combine that with the admin and logistics needed to break away for 6 months from the encumbrances of “real life,” including bills, taxes, mortgage/rent, home security, family issues, vehicle issues, and so on, and things get quite complex very quickly.



Liz and I chose to deal with this by laying a sheet of ‘butcher paper’ across our dining room table 6 months before beginning our hike and writing down everything we could think of that needed to be done.  A pencil rested constantly beside the paper, and we added anything that came to mind.  
About 3 months out, we start addressing items one by one.  Then, 3 weeks out we plugged items into our respective calendars to ensure we didn’t miss anything.  
As I write this a week from our late February departure, we have several more to go but we have checked off most items; importantly, taxes are filed, autopay is in effect for our bills, and mail, cars, and home security are all looked after.

(Ok, this is classic; as I lay here in my hammock near Hawk Mountain Shelter, a Ranger School ambush took place less than 100 yards away in the growing dusk & fog. I don’t envy those folks it’s about 35 degrees & raining steadily. Comfy in my hammock and quilts...)
Yup, as beautiful as it was yesterday, today was just the opposite.
Liz, Lola and I left the Springer Mountain parking lot at about noon and we hiked North about 2 miles to first shelter. There, we ate lunch and met two felllow thru hikers, Walrus and Why Not? Liz and Lola departed after that for their adventures. I hiked on about six more miles to Hawk Mountain.
The shelter is full of about 12 young people; 20-somethings-it’s delightful to hear their enthusiastic chatter.
Afraid my poor signal strength does not let me send pictures, but I have some and will send them along at first opportunity.
Good night, all. More tomorrow.

Wingnut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626624,"Hi, all,
Quick note to catch up...
Apologies for tardiness - almost no cell coverage on the trail so far.
Made it into Neel Gap @ mil 31.3 @ 1100, soaked to the bone but pleased with mileage and pace. (BTW - GPS readings may not reflect that distance; i sometimes forget to turn the darned thing on until I'm a ways down the trail...!)
FoxGirl and I are using the afternoon to recce Helen, GA where we will take a day of rest (a 'zero' day in trail parlance) this coming Sunday.  Am writing from town library.
Some observations after 3 days on trail:  
1. Not unexpected parallels between starting the AT and beginning HS or College; everyone is new, unsure of themselves, and unaware of the reality of the trail and what it will bring.  Classic was the gentle kind fellow atop Springer Mountain who asked which way the trail went.
2. First person we met on the trail, trail-name ""Why Not?,"" turned out to be a Special Ops helo pilot; we had many mutual friends and shared experiences - small world.
3. Listening to chatter, especially amongst 20-somethings @ shelters, leads to the realization that just about everyone who is thru-hiking the trail, be they youngsters taking time off from HS or College, or older, retired folks, is forgoing 'normal' life for this experience.  There appear to be a rare few folks who sort of live on the trail...they add a different perspective to evening conversations.
4. Army Ranger School Mountain Phase takes place in the vicinity of the first 15 miles or so of the trail.  It's not unusual to hear an ambush kick off a few hundred years from where we are camped.  On day 2 a couple of us ran into a Ranger patrol.  The Ranger Instructors got a kick out of the fact that I went through the course a couple of decades before they were born.  This morning a bunch of fit young fellows with rucksacks running from Woody Gap to Neels Gap - about 15 tough miles - smoked past us.  Turns out they are ""Best Ranger"" candidates from a number of US units and the British Parachute Regiment. See pic with SSG from my old outfit.  He thanked me for my service - but he has deployed to combat 6 times.  Not even close.
5. At this stage of the trail, when we are not hiking long distances, when sunrise is late, and sunset early, and we have no cell coverage in the GA mountains, one of the bigger challenges is keeping oneself engaged from 7:30 at night until 6:30 in the morning, especially when rain coming down in sheets limits opportunities to visit.  Even out here, a person can only sleep so much...seriously boring.
I will stop there to go prep for tomorrow.  See pics.
More this weekend.

About 30 of us are camped in and around Low Gap Shelter.GPS track is accurate if you are  following.The day was cloudy and blustery but thankfully no rain!
This evening the temperatures dropped radically and the wind has really picked up. I am writing from my sleeping bag at about 7:30 PM. Temperatures appear to be in the low 20s and the wind is howling. Getting set up was a challenge but now that we are  tucked in I think we’ll be fine. Sleeping bag is rated 0° and should be OK.M

It really did get cold last night; reports pretty much confirm the temperature was between 10 and 15°. The wind howled all night, but eased up in the morning.  Sleeping wasn’t bad, although 12 hours in one position is as boring as I mentioned earlier. Getting up this morning was a challenge. As was breaking camp. But only way to warm up was to get on the trail and start walking.There we found acres and acres of frost pressing up through the dirt, fragile and beautiful.

Wingnut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626715,"Hi All,
Ahhh - first day off....
Nice to shower, eat real food, sleep, eat real food, do laundry, eat real food, nap, eat....well, you get the idea...
Since starting last Mon, 2 Mar, we've navigated about 53 mi of the AT from its Southern Terminus on Springer Mtn to Unicoi Gap in northern GA.
We are ""Zeroing"" - not hiking - for a day of rest, maintenance, and recovery.  We chose to do so on a lovely warm and sunny spring weekend (rain returns when we resume hiking tomorrow, of course...) in the remarkably Deutsch tourist town of Helen, GA; from wurst und kartoffel to dozens of types of old country bier...heck, the streets are even called 'strasse.' Intriguing - and a fun break.
A couple of reflections on Week #1:
1. Personalities. Remarkable camaraderie has quickly developed amongst the 15 or so folks I've been hiking with.  About 50/50 men and women, many in their 20s, a number over 55, a few in between. We often walk by ourselves or perhaps with one or 2 others but when we gather around the shelter picnic table to cook our suppers, the good natured ribbing and kidding knows no bounds.  I find shared hardship and experience quickly form hard and fast bonds...not unlike those forged in combat.  
2. Hike Your Own Hike. We are finding that, particularly in consistently bad weather, folks will choose to take a day off trail to warm up and dry off.  Very personal, very different.  Occasionally, they find creative approaches...as FoxGirl and I were hiking on day, a trio of folks without packs approached us from the opposite direction. I recognized them from a recent shelter and was baffled.  Turns out they took a night @ a nearby hostel to dry out and the proprietor offer to drive them forward so they could walk unencumbered back to his hostel for another night...everyone wins - hikers get their miles, hostel owner earns more profit. They call this 'slack packing.'
 3. Solitude.  As noted, I often find i walk by myself.  When the sun is out my shadow (yup, the one in the photo who whined about the cold...) accompanies me but that's usually it. I find I have to work to calm down the repetitive Linda Ronstadt tunes, commercial ditties, cadence calls, and random noise that echo around in my head and focus instead on the remarkable surroundings and this exceptional opportunity for introspection.  I've got some work to do to discipline myself.
4. Balance.  Sharing this hike with FoxGirl, who hikes with me every couple days and who sits across from me now typing her reflections, is most rewarding and satisfying. I found, however, that when FoxGirl came by to pick me up outside Helen I was resting at our link-up point with our steadily arriving colleagues. Departing from them to spend a day with FoxGirl was surprisingly difficult; unsure when/if I will see those hiking pals again as even a short separation and subsequent decisions can take us on our own way.  Fox and I had a long talk about this over morning coffee today...another thing to contemplate and work on.
OK - time to pack food for next week.
More soon.","Helen, GA

No connectivity all week - so some catch ups:
This day - 9 Mar - F Girl dropped me off @ Unicoi Gap, and I hiked to top of Trey (not Tye) Mtn.  Set up there on lovely evening enjoying views  in valley.
Pic of hammock rig accompanies this entry.
About 3 am wind started to blow and rain began.  I arose about 6 AM and started to pack up.  I went to get my food bag, protected by hanging on ""Bear Cables,"" but by the time I returned a huge gust had ripped all stakes from the ground and the tarp was flapping wildly.
I managed to stuff everything into my pack but knew I needed a dry place to work - a big shelter....and the nearest one was over 15 miles away.

Wingnut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626942,"Hi All,
This day, Liz and I agreed to meet for lunch & hike @ Deep Gap.
I arrived to find lot empty - but ""LaLa"" and Nick told me they had just returned from a shuttle to town and Fox and her Scamp were just down the road.
I started down the twisting road only to rediscover that ""just down the road"" @ 20 mph is very different from 2.5 mph...long walk!
Finally found Fox where she had very cleverly packed the Scamp on a side-road, rigged a rain tarp and was living very comfortably, thank you very much!
We caught up, told our stories, then, with Lola, drove back up the road to Deep Gap, shoulder packs in the rapidly increasing fog and rain, and headed to Standing Indian Shelter where we shared lunch with ""Owl Cat"" and her pup, ""PR,"" and ""Atlas,"" an infantry veteran of service in Iraq.  
After lunch we all headed for Carter Gap in drenching rain and thick fog.  OC and A pushed ahead as Fox told me of her writing and the fascinating sci-fi trilogy she was reading - total mental immersion and rain distraction - awesome!
Sadly, Fox and Lola turned around to head back after about 4 mi and I pushed on to Carter Gap arriving about 5 PM to join 4 in shelter and about 12 tenters/hammockers.
It was raining and 'gustily' dreary as I ate dinner and set up hammock.  But recalling my experience on Trey Mountain, I moved to a somewhat sheltered location on the leeward side of the hill.
Good thing I did...","
",Carter Gap Shelter,"Mar 12, Thu",12.50
Wingnut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626944,"Hi All,
So...big news was that this was the day we completed our initial 100 miles.
But real story was surviving the gale @ Carter Gap...
As the storm began to subside about 5 AM with my tarp intact and in good shape, I decided to strap on my red-light headlamp and pack up. I knew I was heading to a long walk but then a link-up with Fox and a night in a nice, warm hotel room...so morale was good.
After dealing with sopping wet everything and shouldering a now-much-heavier pack, at about 6 AM I stumbled in the fog, dark, and increasing wind and rain to the front porch of the shelter where I brewed up a life-giving  - and hand warming - cup of coffee.  Ahhh!  
The wind suddenly howled with a new intensity and the rain became horizontal. Soon the cries of anguish came again.  ""Cosmo,"" her headlamp dimly glowing, walked into the shelter with an armful of tent, sleeping bag, and assorted gear.  She dumped it on the ground thoroughly pissed and 'stormed' back out to regain the rest of her kit while I brewed her a coffee.  She recovered remarkably quickly, and slowly re-stowed her pack; what a trooper!
After that start, the rest of the day was fairly tame; see the first related picture for a sense of the nastiness of the clouds and rain Odin continued to deliver.  We crossed 100 mi @ about 1100.  Modest, but a milestone nevertheless.  Stopped @ a shelter for lunch and found inscription @ 3rd related photo - very odd.  We had seen similar inscriptions @ other shelters - this was most explicit. 
As I descended, the sun finally emerged and it warmed markedly. As I struggled, sweating for once, to the summit of Winding Stair Gap, I found Lola running toward me.  She and Fox had hiked in to welcome me.  We found a log on a ridge looking west over the hills and valleys toward Franklin.  The leafless trees nevertheless had a particular softness to them...lovely portent of spring.  
We followed a pair of fellow travelers down to the gap and headed into Franklin, NC for: showers, beer, a groaning table of unhealthy food, and, finally, SLEEP.","Carter Gap Shelter

Wingnut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627227,"This was an interesting week that began with us eating a pancake breakfast in the basement of a Baptist Church in Franklin, NC - and ended in a way we never expected.
FoxGirl (FG) and Lola dropped me off at Winding Stair Gap in steady rain about 1100 last Sunday, March 15th.  I followed Skirt up the hill to Siler Bald Shelter (see initial photo for March 15) and joined him and Shady there for lunch.  The shelter is on a long, loopy, STEEP, blue-blaze trail that circumvents and doubles the distance over the more gentle AT white-blazed bald...not my smartest move.
I found myself pressing down hill behind a bearded fellow who turned out to be an incredibly fit 40-yr old Brit called Insomnia.  He started almost a week behind me and has been doing 20 mile-days since day 1; most impressive.  Insomnia and I exchanged stories as we stopped for Trail Magic Cocoa provided by Lucky Moon (see pics #2 and 3 for 15 March) before climbing up, up, up to the tower atop Wayah Bald.  We reached there about 5 PM on a gorgeous evening (see pic #4 for 15 March). After a pause for water and a snack, Insomnia shouldered his pack and headed off for 8 more miles; I never saw him again.
I descended the mile or so to the Wayah Bald Shelter where I set up my tarp and hammock and joined fellow hikers for dinner-time chat at the shelter.  Here I linked up with the crew I would be hiking with for much of the week:  3 fellow hammockers, Owl Cat and her pup PR, Pipes (whom FG had named as she heard his golden tones floating above Winding Stairs), and Griz.  Tenters Northstar and newly-named Hummingbird. And shelter-dwellers, Ms AT and her pal, Puddles, who hiked barefoot in sandals.  Great folks.  We agreed on a 12 mile day the next day into Wesser Bald Shelter.
I rolled out with my alarm the next morning at about 6:30 to thick fog.  Could see about 10 feet. By this time, my morning routine was fairly refined. I was able to dress, stuff and compress my sleeping bag and underquilt, cook and eat breakfast, pack hammock and tarp, and get ready to hike in about an hour and a half.  
So, about 8 AM I headed down the trail to Tellico Gap enroute Wesser Bald.  The thick fog blanketed all of the vistas but at the micro-level offered beautiful mist-covered plants and spider webs (see photos #1 and 2 for 16 March). As I descended I ran into a group of fellows from University of Texas slogging up the hill towards me.  They were not finding the damp, dreary, muddy AT to be the trail they had come East for.  We would see them again.
As I approached the Gap, I noticed a sign for Trail Magic beside the trail.  Sure enough, as I stepped from the woods I met Vietnam Veteran River Squid and his wife with comfy chairs, sodas, cookies, candy, and snacks.  I dropped my pack and exchanged stories with them.  Turns out they regularly provide support to hikers, especially on weekdays.  These wonderful folks are true Angels (see photo #3 for 16 March).
From there it was up and over Wesser Bald - still enshrouded in fog - and down to the shelter.  I was first to arrive at about 2 PM; others rolled in as I set up my tarp and hammock.  By dinner time we had a good 25 folks in and around the shelter...including those folks from UT who had turned around.  We learned that the President had just ordered no gatherings of more than 10 people due to Corona Virus - but we chuckled that we were probably safe from prosecution in our remote hideaway.
That night it rained and rained and rained - through dawn and into the next morning without letting up.
Few things are less enjoyable while on the trail than packing up wet gear - but it can't be avoided.  So in a drenching downpour, we shouldered packs and headed down the steep, rocky, 5 mile trail to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) fighting slippery roots and mud all the way.  By the time we reached NOC I had fallen at least 5 times and was covered in mud. So I headed to the lovely warm laundry room, donned my less-grungy sleeping clothes, and exploded my pack to dry things out as my clothes washed and dried.  FG and Lola, who were camped @ the NOC, found me there and soon we were caught up, clean, dry, and happy.
It was @ NOC that we first began to understand the impact of the virus on the trail.  Realizing that it was St Patty's Day, we had beer with lunch @ the NOC restaurant and were then told that this was the final meal they would serve as they were closing due to the virus.  Almost all the facilities @ NOC were closing down.  Our sad waitress told us she would remain in employee accommodations and hope to get some food from the kitchen but the closure was of indefinite duration.
FG and I briefly stopped by the soon-to-be-closed outfitter, picked up my resupply meals, and began the 7 mile climb to Sassafras Shelter - one of the tougher sections on the AT.  FG and Lola hiked with me for several hours before returning to our base camp @ NOC. I pushed on finally reaching the area around Sassafras Shelter @ dusk.  I was exhausted.  By the time I arrived there were no camping sites left.  Fortunately, hammocks offer great flexibility in choosing ""hang"" sites and while the slope I ended up on was quite steep, I had my best night's sleep on the trail.
We decided on another 12 mile day for the 18th to set the stage for our push into Fontana Dam.  That morning we learned that due to the virus the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) had forbidden hikers who had not started the trail from beginning and counseled those of us on the trail to get off and spend at least a couple of weeks in isolation to ensure we were not carrying.  We also learned that traditional ""Trail Towns"" like Hot Springs, NC were not allowing hikers in as then may be carrying the virus (This was not illogical as we had dined with many folks @ Lazy Hiker Brewery and 76 Outfitter in Franklin, NC and could have contacted the virus there.  Rumor was that at least one fellow hiker behind us was showing symptoms of the virus.)  But as there was nothing we could do, we set out for our morning objective, Stecoah Gap.
Finally, we had a cool, clear gorgeous day and we swung along happily hiking above the clouds (see the 2 pics for 18 March). As we descended into the wayside picnic area at the Gap, we found that a thoughtful day hiker had left us a big box of luscious (and washed!) strawberries and a mound of candy bars - heaven! From there it seemed like a very long stretch into the campsite @ Cody Gap but were were in by 4 PM.  We rushed to set up as a drizzle began but it didn't amount to much and we ate dinner looking forward to taking some time off when we reached the Fontana Lake/Dam complex.  
A spirited young Boy Scout took the pic that accompanies this post as we ate breakfast on 19 March.  This would be a 9 mile day into Fontana Village and the exquisite ""Fontana Hilton"" shelter with running water, showers, solar powered electricity and other amenities.  FG and I would be staying @ a B&B and one of the proprietors offered to meet me where the AT crosses a road near his home and take some of my pack items there for me.  I welcomed this opportunity to ""slack pack"" and cut the weight of my burden in half.  Very nice. We hiked up and over our final hill and down a long reach into the Fontana Dam area.  Our lunch stop was @ a trail crossing near a Marina.  By now it was sunny and well into the 70s so as we waited for a shuttle into Fontana Village, we refreshed with ice-cold beer from the Marina store.  When the shuttle arrived, I said good-bye to my hiking partners and headed to the Fontana Hilton to link up with FG and Lola.  We linked up and enjoyed hiking together the mile + past the shelter to the Visitor Center @ the Dam where FG had parked.
We swung by Fontana Village enroute our B&B and found that the majority of its stores and restaurants were closed.  The only available resupply came from whatever boxes folks had sent to the Fontana Post Office.  And next leg is the Smokies with no resupply available for 70-odd miles.
By this time, I had heard from my Sister - a Doc - and from both my daughters.  Each counseled that the virus was a serious deal and that we should get off trail. FG agreed.
When we arrived @ the B&B I looked in a mirror for the first time in a week or so.  I found that the white portion of my left eye  was pretty well covered in blood.  I assume this was a result of hitting my head when I fell in that shelter back on 13 March or so.  That did it - I agreed to temporarily suspend our hike and head home to NoVA to get checked out.
....I am convinced this is the right thing to do....but it is certainly not the way I had hoped the week would end.","Winding Stair Gap

Bottom line - Fox Girl (FG) and I are at home in VA.  
Reasons: 
1. Advice from FG, my Doctor Sister, my daughters, and our dear hiking friends. 
2. Advice from Appalachian Trail Conservancy and hiking professionals
3. Governmental directed closures of towns, facilities, hiking shelters, stores, etc. along the trail.  
4. Blood in my left eye from hitting my head in Shelter o/a 13 March. (Have now been to ER - all well: blood receding and CAT Scan normal)
Next Step:
Liz is picking up Esme' from MI now.
Plan:
We hope to get back on trail around 1 April assuming virus begins to recede.
We will update then.
