Hello all! Wow, nearly a year has gone by since my last journal post. I had originally planned to do two or more section hikes in 2020 to build upon the section hikes that I did in 2019 but the pandemic has impacted just about every aspect of all of our lives. 
It may not be one of the wisest decisions I have made but I have decided to get at least one section hike completed this year. I simply cannot resist the cool crisp air and color changes of my favorite time of the year to be outdoors!



The plan is for my beautiful wife to drop me off at the PA/MD border (AT Southbound mile marker 1,126.0) around midday on Monday 10/05/20. This is where I terminated my final section hike (Section Hike 3) in 2019. I will be heading south from there with the flexibility to go as far or as long as I like but will most likely only be spending a week or two in the woods. I tend to get a bit homesick beyond that.
My wife and I have done quite a few day hikes and even one recent overnighter this year but I am really excited to stretch the legs out and cover some bigger miles and experience more of the AT.

PA/MD Border 1,125.6 to Ensign Cowell Shelter 1,135.4


Let me start off by saying “I love being outdoors, especially in the mountains, this time of the year”. 


Since I had a relatively short mileage goal for day one I decided to start hiking a bit later in the day. My wife and I drove to Waynesboro, PA and did a little last minute grocery shopping and had a really good lunch at the Red Run Grill. Both my Southern Style Beef BBQ and my wife’s Crabby Fries were delicious. After lunch we drove the two or three remaining miles up PenMar Road to where the AT crosses the road. The border sign is only a couple of hundred feet south of there. My wife joined me for those couple of hundred feet so that we could take a photo or two. We then said our goodbyes and back to the car she went as I started my distance-yet-to-be-determined SOBO Section Hike. 



The afternoon went rather quickly and the forest is beautiful. I only saw 9 other hikers on the trail all afternoon. Four pairs of two and a single. It seems rather overkill to me but a few of those hikers were wearing a mask. I assume that they just put it on briefly as we passed. I simply refuse to wear a mask while I’m hiking! Distancing works for me! I am even going to avoid staying in the shelters on this trip as part of the social distancing strategy. 


After eating supper I walked down to the shelter area to hang my food bag on the bear pole and there were three hikers in the shelter. Of course I had to stop over and say hi. I had a great conversation with those guys. Two of the three were very experienced and knowledgeable hikers and we talked about a vast array of hiker topics. Two of their names I actually recognized from all the hiker stuff I read on the web. Happy and Jukebox. Real cool dudes!


Well, it’s about hiker midnight and I have a big day tomorrow. I want to close by thanking by beautiful wife for getting me to and from the trail and for allowing me to indulge in the outdoors the way I do. I love you babe!

I did not sleep very well last night so rather than laying in my tent and staring at the ceiling I packed up and hit the trail well before daylight. I actually enjoy hiking in the dark once in a while. The early start allowed me to get good miles in and still get to camp pretty early. 


It was another picture perfect day for hiking but I only saw a few other hikers today. One interesting couple that I spoke with for a bit was hiking the Maryland section of the AT (Around 41 miles). What made them interesting was that they were both married but not to each other. They told me that neither her husband nor his wife were interested in hiking so their spouses gave them their permission to multi-day hike together. Hhhmmmm. 



The rocks are taking a toll on my feet again just like they did during my Pennsylvania section hike. I put some Leukotape on the balls of my feet to see if that helps. Tomorrow will be an interesting day.Pretty tired. Hopefully I sleep better tonight.

I slept a lot better last night but still found myself waking up at 3:30 AM, wide awake. So what do I do? I pack up and hit the trail with my headlamp or course! I kinda like getting such an early start so that I can get some decent miles in and then set up camp early and have plenty of time to relax and enjoy the rest of the day at camp. 


It was yet another picture perfect day for hiking today. Not too many other hikers but I did get to meet and talk to a few. Reaching the WV/VA just south of Harpers Ferry was real satisfying. I have now completed 4 of the 15 states that the AT runs through. Maine, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. Whoopee!


Water is particularly hard to find so far with many of the sources dried up. When I do locate water I not only fill up my two water bottles, a 1 liter and a 700 ml, but I also fill up my 1.5 liter bladder. I then have a total of 3.2 liters. That certainly puts more weight on my back but it more than pays for itself in peace-of-mind. 


I gave myself a special treat today. The AT crosses a road, WV Route 9, three miles before the shelter I planned to stop at. My Guthook app told me that there was a Liberty gasoline/convenience store just .3 miles up that road. So I walked there and got myself a chicken salad sub and two bottles of sugary soda. I chugged the Cherry Pepsi on the spot and stuffed the Mountain Dew and the sub in my pack for future indulgence. Real near future!




The trail up until WV Route 9 was still strewn with millions of rocks so my feet did not get much of a break today. I have been trying to manage the blisters but they definitely take some of the enjoyment out of my hike.The last three miles to the shelter were much smoother so hopefully it will stay that way.

With each passing night I sleep better but again found myself waking up around 3:30 AM. So why would I want to deviate from my ritual, especially since I knew I had a big day on tap. My 20+ mile day was to include the infamous “Roller Coaster”. The Roller Coaster is a 13.4 mile ROCKY section of the AT that includes about a dozen significant climbs, and descents. Oh boy, I’m not sorry that is behind me!


It was yet another beautiful autumn day. It seemed that I had the AT all to myself except for an occasional day hiker near the roads. 


Water continued to be a rare commodity today. I always load up with extra when I find some.


My blister management techniques are not working at all. The relentless rocky terrain in the roller coaster section just magnified the situation to the point that I just cannot continue. It is just no fun hiking with two painful feet. So, my Section Hike 4 will be coming to an end much earlier than I had hoped. The love of my life will be picking me up tomorrow at the first road to the south of the shelter that I am staying at tonight. My guide says that it is 3.6 miles away. I’ve got to figure out what I am doing wrong with my footwear selection.

I would have given just about anything last night for a miracle overnight blister cure. The reality is that they were still there waiting for me this morning when I woke up. 
It would have been a little easier to accept if I had been hiking in the rain for days and my feet had been more susceptible to blistering but I had the most beautiful five day stretch of picture perfect autumn days a person could ask for. Why do I have such blister prone feet? Why? Why?


So, it was a bittersweet day today. My Section Hike 4 was coming to an end but I was very excited about getting to see my wife. I had sent her a “Marked Location” tag that I had created with the Maps app on my iPhone which directed her to the exact spot that I would be exiting the woods onto US 50/17. Turns out we timed it perfectly. She had arrived there just a couple of minutes before me. 



The weather forecasters have forecasted significant rainfall for a couple of days beginning on Sunday. The rain is remnants of hurricane Delta which came ashore in Louisiana this morning. I can say that I don’t think that would have been much fun hiking in anyway.
So how does a person suppress disappointment in oneself? By gulping down a Denny’s Gram Slam breakfast meal of course.

Let me start off by saying that I feel very lucky to have such a wonderful and understanding wife that not only accepts the fact that I like to spend time on the trail but also supports me in every way possible!


Today was a picture perfect autumn day in the mountains and the leaves are turning color and are beautiful. There were a few climbs that tested my legs out a bit today but not too bad. The terrain is much smoother and less rocky than what I left behind in PA and MD. 


I am trying out a new brand of trail shoe on this section hike with the hopes that I do not have a repeat of the blister problems I’ve had in the past. Unfortunately only a couple of hours into today’s hike I started to feel a repeat of the blister on the ball of the left foot that took me off the trail on the previous section hike. Tomorrow morning I am going to try a petroleum based cream called Trail Toes to see if that helps. Fingers crossed. 


I want to close by thanking my beautiful wife for getting me to the trail at daylight this morning! I love you babe!

Today was another picture perfect autumn day in the mountains.



The ATC recently published a newsletter where, amongst other topics, they had a paragraph dedicated around increasing awareness and trying to get more diversity on the AT. In that same paragraph the author suggested multiple times that those of us that have the time, can afford the gas to get to and from the trail and can afford the gear are privileged! This threw me for a loop and upset me quite a bit when I first read it. I have my reasons for the way I felt but as I sit out here on the AT on this beautiful autumn evening I suppose that I do feel a bit privileged.My legs were tested again today with multiple significant climbs. What do I expect, I am on the AT after all. The terrain continues to be much smoother and less rocky than what I left behind in PA and MD though. 



The blister on the ball of my left foot continues to aggravate me but it does not seem to be a whole lot worse than yesterday. The Trail Toes may have helped some so I will apply it again tomorrow morning. I now have a blister on the heel of the same foot.I saw several whitetail up close today but they seemed camera shy as they all spooked off the trail as I got my phone out. 



There are quite a few section and day hikers on the AT. It’s the perfect time to get out and enjoy. Oh, and I am now in the Shenandoah National Park.Another big day tomorrow so I’m going to get some well needed rest.

Gravel Springs Hut 1,233.9 to Byrd’s Nest #3 Hut 1,251.4


Yet another picture perfect autumn day in the mountains. Just a little bit on the warm side though. For the first 13 miles I had the trail all to myself. I only started seeing other hikers once I got to the Skyline Drive parking lot near Thornton Gap. There were lots of folks parking there to climb to the Mary’s Rock overlook. It was only about an 1,100 foot climb but it seemed higher since I already had 14 miles on my legs. Took me an hour to climb that booger. 



The blisters did not bother me as much today. I rubbed some more Trail Toes cream on the ball of my left foot and put some Leukotape on the blister on my heel this morning so it seems to have helped.I received some trail magic today. I was talking to a family of four day hikers that stopped at the Byrd’s Nest Shelter for a break and they gave me a spare bottle of water. That little gesture will save me from having to walk to the spring which is about three tenths of a mile downhill from the shelter. I was so appreciative! And then a little later in the day another day hiker handed me another bottle, along with a mile a minute conversation and a confession that he was born again during an Amway convention. Whew...


I don’t mean to be judgmental but why do people buy those noisy air mattresses that wake up the entire neighborhood when you shift around on them. A guy pitched his tent about 20 feet from mine last night and I don’t know what he was doing in there but that loud crackling noise went on for 2 hours, almost non-stop! Then he finished up by playing Amazing Grace and Silent Night on his harmonica! Actually that was sort of neat but it was getting late. Oh boy!

Yet another picture perfect autumn day in the mountains. How did I get so lucky!


My left foot was pretty much the same today! I did a fairly light day today so as not to push my luck. Weird that my right foot has given me no problems at all. 


I passed by Skyland Resort today and it was a hustling mass of humanity. Apparently I am not the only one to think that this is the perfect time to be in the Shenandoah’s. There was an AT detour in that area which was quite confusing. I spent a bit of time trying to figure that one out. 


I was fortunate to get a campsite at Big Meadows and I’m glad the office was able to wrangle me one up. This place is packed also and they were turning people away that did not have reservations. I explained to them that all I needed was a tiny site because all I had was a tiny tent. I think they felt sorry for me. It did cost me $20 though. Plus I spent an additional $3.75 for a 5 minute shower and a good cold Pepsi. I’m not sure which felt better. The only unfortunate part is that my site is at the farthest part of the campground from the AT. About 1/2 mile.

A 5th and final picture perfect autumn day in the mountains. I could not have asked for a more perfect week to be out there! 


Aside from a few day hikers that I saw near popular campsites there weren’t many hikers out today. I saw only one other section hiker. It’s pretty easy to tell a section hiker or thru-hiker from a day hiker. I was the only hiker of any kind to hike the last few mile section of today’s hike. I could tell by the frequency of spider webs across my face that I encountered. 


My wonderful wife and my mother graciously drove the 2 3/4 hours to Swift Run Gap to pick me up. I’m not sure how I would go about doing these hikes if it weren’t for their support. Thank you!
