Trouble,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606115,Never in a million years did I imagine that I would be making early preparations to hike the Appalachian Trail. My first encounter with it was when I was 16 and we spent a weekend in Vermont. The steep uphill climb was enough to overwhelm me--now I'm crazy enough to get ready to undertake to travel over 2000 miles uphill and down. Let the training begin.,,View Entry,"Dec 29, Sat",0
Trouble,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606116,"What sets me apart from the rest of the hiking crowd is that I'm disabled (or was disabled...or am formerly abled...) and for the last ten years, a wheelchair has been a part of my daily life. Diagnosed with MS and having lost my ability to walk due to Transverse Myelitis, no one expected there to be much in regards to recovery after the first years came and went without much improvement. 
Low and behold, in the summer of 2016, there started to be small changes to my sensation and ability to move. Over the last two years, I've been able to progress from having almost no movement in my legs and left arm, to being nearly fully recovered and I plan to be ready to take on the Appalachian Trail in 2020 along with my daughter Jayce (trail name TBD). 
My goals are set, I need only worry about meeting each one in a timely manner. With loads of effort and a little faith, I look forward to making this life-changing journey.",,View Entry,"Dec 29, Sat",0
Trouble,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606117,"The biggest challenge in overcoming a disability is choosing when to make a break from habit and push my comfort levels a little. I still use a wheelchair when I go out and I am able to walk unaided inside my home. My initial goal is to be able to walk a mile with my walker without needing a break and from then, I feel confident enough to rely on hiking poles to help maintain my balance while I transition to walking unaided outside. I'm giving myself to the end of March 2019 to meet this goal. While it may seem like a long time, this is the hardest part of my current recovery. Years of being unable to walk have made my muscles into something that babies would find weak. It's now time to strengthen them. Once I surpass this point, I don't see much difficulty in extending my distance a little every day until (by the time fall rolls around) I should be able to hike about 10 miles. After that comes training on hills and weight on my back. Wish me luck!",,View Entry,"Dec 29, Sat",0
