Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626850,"  Well the dust hasn't really settled from our last hike yet. I am back at work for the summer and heavily into that right now. I will be working night shift again which plays havoc with my sleep schedule. I spite of that I have already started planning for the 2020 section of the AT. I am roughing in a schedule and also making plans to train a lot more for the 2020 section to try to avoid the blisters, knee and heel pain issues from last year.",,View Entry,"May 01, Wed",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626851,"  Summer has come and gone. My season of work will come to a close at the end of this month. My roughed out plan for the AT in 2020 has us backpacking through the Smokies. Neither of us have backpacked in over a dozen years so I spent the summer trying to upgrade our gear - getting some items each time I got a paycheck. :) I think we are where we want to be on that end of things but we haven't tested the new system yet. Steve is not wild about backpacking. He says he is past the point in life of sleeping on the ground. We will have to see how that shakes out. I am starting my plan of walking a lot more. Tucker is going to help with that. Another change I am going to make is to try out trail runners rather than light hikers for trail shoes. I've always hiked in mid length light hikers because I rolled my ankles so much when I was running that I don't really have ligament support there any more. Trail runners don't have ankle support but they are so much lighter. I am also going to go to using 2 hiking poles. Traditionally I haven't hiked with poles. My thoughts are that my legs and ankles will be stronger if I don't rely on poles for support. However, it may be time to rethink that position and go with 2 poles will save wear and tear on my knees. We are coming into winter in Montana which will make for some tougher walking conditions.    ",,View Entry,"Oct 01, Tue",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626852,"I have been walking regularly and am up to around 32 miles a week. Steve and I went to Tucson for a month with Tucker. We hiked and biked every day down there in the mountains around Tucson. That got me some elevation practice without having to deal with snow and ice. I still haven't settled on a pair of trail runners yet. I haven't found a pair I like the feel of yet. We did an overnight on Mount Lemmon. My pack was riding too high, putting the weight on my shoulders. I was able to adjust my suspension system so that the pack rides down on my hips now. That should make a big improvement. The gear overall worked well. The tent I have is too small for 2 people and a dog. Good thing Tucker will stay behind in Montana with an Aunt when we go to North Carolina. :) Steve had an issue with his Thermarest losing all its air during the night so he had a pretty miserable night. I took it and filled a bathtub with water to see if there was a leak but couldn't find one. Not really sure what the issue was there. I had thought maybe one of Tuckers nails punctured it when he went to bed and started digging a nest for himself in the tent. Tucker is pretty funny. He has a set idea of when bedtime is and he wanted in the tent at that time to go to bed. He then rearranges the sleeping bags to make himself a nice comfy place to sleep. Humans have to work around him. It got down to the upper 30s that night which gave me a chance to test my clothes system. I'll make a few changes there but I feel pretty comfortable with what I have. I will be cutting some things out.",,View Entry,"Dec 15, Sun",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626853,"Steve sat down with me and went over the plan. We made reservations and booked our plane trip. I always like it when Steve gets involved. He looks at things with a more critical eye and pays more attention to the details. We finished up the plan but it has already changed. My father has been ill with dementia and requiring 24/7 care from my mother for the past 2 years. He passed away near the end of January. It was tough knowing he will never be there again for me to talk to but he is in a better place now. I thought my Mother was going to run herself into the ground trying to take care of him. Things were a little easier on her once she started getting consistent help with Dad during the day. As to the VA system, I'll just say they don't do enough and the long waits to get services are very real. I was not impressed. Mom is now in a new place in life moving forward without the man she spent the last 57 years with. We invited her to come with us this year and she agreed to help sag us. She is very excited about this trip and is starting to walk now that she has the time as well.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Sat",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626854,"Steve and I are in Baja California for 6 weeks. Steve finally decided to get serious about his training for this trip in December and has been working hard since then. I settled on a pair of trail runners. I am using a pair of La Sportivas. They have a narrow heel which fits my foot anatomy well. They are very comfortable for hiking, even on rocky trails. I am going to try them with a pair of Superfeet to see if they are better with or without the insole. I came out of my work season with a pretty severe case of plantar fasciitis. It had gradually been getting better once I stopped working and is now completely gone. I can hike a 14 mile day with no heel pain. We have bumped our weekly mileage to up above 40 miles per week. The only thing I can see possibly derailing our plans right now is the Corona virus. We are keeping a close eye on that. My husband will turn 70 this year and my Mom is 84. Those are two people that would be better off not catching the virus.",,View Entry,"Mar 10, Tue",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626974,"Corona virus may be creating havoc around the world but here on the Baja, life is business as usual. There are no confirmed cases in the Baja. For Friday the 13th, we started with a short 1.6 mile hike to a microwave tower. It was a nice little up and because it was early in the day and short, Tucker got to come along. After that Steve and I drove out into the desert and decided to try to find a new way to a beach we like on foot. We parked along the Transpenninsular Highway and took off down a dirt road. We followed it for a ways and when it split, we went left. It split again and we went right. We followed it until it dead-ended at a wide spot in the middle of nowhere. There was an arroyo near there that kind of headed the right direction. It was way easier to walk a rocky arroyo than to try to go cross country through impenetrable cactus thickets so we started following arroyos. We would follow one for a ways and then it would peter out so we would move over into another one and follow that. After quite a ways we realized we were paralleling the coast rather than getting closer to it. We found an old pasture that had been cleared of cactus a long time ago so we headed across that toward the coast. We saw two different sets of 2 Mexican cows. The clearing didn't last but we did find a cow trail in the clearing that appeared to be headed toward the coast so we followed that through 4 more makeshift pastures before losing it. A couple of arroyos later and we finally gave up hope of actually making it to the coast.
  At this point, I figured we should cut our losses and try to find our way back to the truck. We found a very old overgrown road that we followed south paralleling the coast. It eventually ran out but then a road headed back west toward our truck. It was overgrown as well. We lost it in an arroyo and then started following that. It finally got us back to our truck. We wound up with a hard 12.5 miles for the day - finishing up with a walk on the beach after getting back to our truck and driving to the beach. 
  I remembered what a friend once told us was the definition of an adventure. If you are in the middle of something and wishing you were home talking about it, then you are having an adventure. This didn't rise to that level but was great fun nevertheless. I love the challenge of finding a way to get from point A to point B without the benefit of a trail and having to use route finding skills. It was a great day and we continue to train for the AT.",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Fri",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626987,Todays hike was to a taller microwave tower followed by relaxation on the beach. I carry a full gallon of water for Tucker. His black solar coat is not made for Mexican heat. He made I all the way up and back though. He is such a trooper! The two guys we started the hike with didn't fare so well. They turned back after half way. I talked with Mom today and she has two friends from her church in Arkansas that will be joining us. That is great as it will give her some quality time with them and also some people to do shorter hikes with. Sounds like our trip is a go barring airline closures.,,View Entry,"Mar 14, Sat",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627176,"Today we went to Punta Arena and camped on the beach to test out our camping system. Things appear to be working well so far. We set up camp and chatted for a little while with Peter and Sandra - the hosts for the beach. They are from British Columbia. Peter invited Steve to play golf in the morning. They have 11 holes laid out in the desert here. You get one club - a 7 iron and play with that and a orange ball. You even putt with your 7 iron. The orange ball is so you can hopefully find it in the cactus. We had Mountain House dinners. Right around twilight we watched 2 frigate birds chasing a seagull. One of the frigate birds swooped in and pecked the sea gull on the butt causing him to squawk and drop down onto the sea. 
   Tucker is loving camping out. We had a small beach fire and then sat around watching the stars come out. The stars are incredible here with zero light pollution. I picked out Orion and his faithful dog, the Pleiades, the Big Dipper and the North Star. We can see one lighthouse from here and 3 other small lights along the Sea of Cortez. We don't hear anything except the sound of an occasional fish flopping in the water. It is comforting to know there are still places like this left in the world.
  Tucker slept outside all night as the tent is too small for the 3 of us. He didn't seem to mind. The only price he paid was getting condensation on his fur which dried quickly in the morning sun. We watched a pink sunrise and then later watched some gulls clamming on the beach. It was low tide and they would swim in the shallow water until they saw a clam below them. They would then tip up like a duck to pick up the clam off the bottom. They would fly up into the air and then drop the clam on the rocks on the beach. If they did that a few times, the shell would crack when it hit the rocks and then they could eat the clam. It was pretty entertaining.",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Sun",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627586,"Well, we came home from Mexico to a land mostly shut down. We have cancelled most of our reservations for the upcoming hike because it isn't going to happen this spring. I still have hopes we can do it this Fall but only time will tell. In the meantime, we continue to hike. Yesterday we did Lion Mountain and today we hiked along the ""Wild Mile"" near Bigfork. Several people were out enjoying an Easter Sunday walk, bike or run - keeping their social distance. Thank God the governor of Montana considers outdoor activities essential. I've seen where other places are trying to limit that. As an alternative plan if the AT doesn't happen this year, I guess I will need to look in my own back yard which would be starting the Continental Divide Trail in sections. It is an easy drive to the Northern terminus for me. So, plan for now, keep training and see what opportunities open up down the line.",,View Entry,"Apr 12, Sun",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627691,"Well I am finally back on a regular hiking schedule. I was in ""letdown mode"" for a while after finding out we wouldn't be able to hike this spring. I am finally coming out of it though and focusing on a possible Fall hike if it works out. We went to the Big Fork Nordic ski Center and did a 4 mile hike there with Tucker. There were several people out walking their dogs and a couple groups of horseback riders enjoying the nice spring day. The temps actually climbed into the 60s. We had to negotiate some blowdowns from an earlier winter storm but all in all it was a fun hike and nice day to be out.",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Sun",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627692,Hiked 6.5 miles yesterday on the Whitefish Trail from the Skyler Lake Trailhead to the Skyler Lake overlook and around. Several mountain bikers as well as hikers were out today. A mom with 6 kids of various sizes was out trying to hike to Beaver Lake. It turned out to be too ambitious a hike for them but the kids were having a great time and no one was complaining. It is great to see kids out enjoying the outdoors rather than playing on their phones or watching tv.,,View Entry,"Apr 21, Tue",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627740,"Today we did an 8.5 mile hike on the Whitefish Trail. Today was the first day of ""shelter at home"" no longer required so lots of people were out and about. Tucker went with us for the hike. The nice thing about Montana is it is pretty dog friendly. It seemed like most everyone out running, walking or biking had a dog with them so Tucker got lots of visits on the trail. The Whitefish Trail is a great trail system that people in Whitefish have worked hard to put together. It is multi use but people are very courteous. I really enjoy living in a place where the majority of people are very active and outdoor oriented. We joke about every other car in the summertime here having either a boat or a bike on it but it isn't far from the truth. We also joke about when you buy a pickup here you need to see what kind of dog comes with it first because almost every pickup seems to have a dog on board. Spring is arriving here with the temp today getting into the 50s. There is no longer snow in the valley although the surrounding mountains are still running 125 percent snow pack. Right now we confine our hiking to lower elevations to avoid the deep snow. It is fun when skiing but not so much when hiking..",,View Entry,"Apr 25, Sat",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627907,"Today Steve, Tucker and I hiked from Beaver Lake Trail up to a high point along the trail and back. It turned out to be around 5.5 miles. We saw a few mountain bikers and hikers but not near the numbers we have seen on other sections of the trail. We also saw a lady with a hound dog walking along the road it was making a ruckus and I'm pretty sure I heard another one off in the woods. I'm not sure if it is still bear hunting season here but that is what came to mind. Flowers are budding out all over. The Indian paint brushes are starting to bloom. Trees are leafing out and it is really green right now. The rivers are up as the snowpack is coming off. Lots of dogs are out enjoying the trails with their owners. We saw one out of control group of mountain bikers hollering and yelling as they came down the trail. It made me wish I had a mask. We got back to the parking lot and they were loading up into a suburban. Three guys and one girl were in the group. It looked like the girl was a guide as she was loading all the bikes. They were parked right next to us and it made me wonder if they weren't from around here. We loaded up quickly and got out of there. We didn't even take time to get Tucker his usual biscuit he gets after finishing a hike, much to his chagrin. All in all it was a fun hike though.",,View Entry,"May 08, Fri",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627908,Today we did 6 miles of hiking on the Whitefish Trail from the Reservoir Trailhead. It is a big mountain biking trail. We were hiking up and had several bikes pass us coming downhill. The Whitefish Trail is a multiuse trail with bikers supposed to yield to hikers but it is easier for us to just get off the trail when we see them coming. Invariably they will say thanks as they pass by. It is a pretty friendly crowd of bikers that use the trails out here. We hiked up to the Valley overlook where we had good views of Whitefish Lake and the town of Whitefish down in the valley. It was cool (56 degrees was the high) and windy today. I was on the verge of being cold most of the day while hiking in shorts and a t-shirt. Tucker sure didn't mind the cool air though. Today we saw a big patch of arrowleaf balsamroot in bloom. Wild strawberries were blooming as well and the huckleberry bushes are leafing out. It was a great way to spend Mother's Day hiking with Steve and Tucker!,,View Entry,"May 10, Sun",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628070,"I did an off trail hike today in the Lubec Hills with friends and Steve and Tucker. It was quite windy, especially since a lot of the hiking was on ridgelines on the east side of the Continental Divide where the wind always seems to blow. There were some patches of snow for Tucker to cool off in. The views and the wildflowers were outstanding. We didn't see much wildlife in the open country we were traversing through but we did see evidence of moose, elk, sheep and a grizzly bear that was doing a lot of digging of roots in the soft soils. We hiked out to an overlook of the south fork of the Two Medicine River drainage before turning around and finding our way back. Our friends Gary and Biddy always bring cookies on the trips we do together so we had cold pizza slices and cookies for lunch at the overlook. Yum! The snow is melting off fast at this elevation - 5000' to 6000'. There is still a lot up higher. I mentioned the wildflowers were great. We saw glacier lilies, anenomies, shooting stars and clumps of flox just to name a few. All in all it was a great day to be outdoors enjoying springlike weather!",,View Entry,"May 16, Sat",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628216,"I am continuing to get mileage in although sometimes it seems that it isn't going to happen this year, especially with the conservancy saying they are still discouraging hiking until a vaccine is in place. We are coming into summer though so maybe with the warmer weather things will slow down. I've heard warmer weather has an effect but some of the hardest hit places are baking right now like Texas and Georgia. So I am continuing to wait and see but moving on with life in Montana in the meantime. We are supposed to reach our first 80 degree day of the year this coming week. I am ready for it after several nights in the 40's and only highs in the 50s and 60s. We hike on Cedar Mountain today - doing some trails we have done before and exploring some new places. The 1.25 inch rain from a couple of days ago left a lot of standing water on the trails and double tracks. A guy running with his dog and a mother with 2 kids and three dogs were the only other people we saw up there on the trails. The weather was a bit breezy and the sun kept playing peekaboo. It was right on the verge between needing a jacket and being fine in a t-shirt. A couple of days ago we hiked on Spencer Mountain - hiking up on the Whitefish Trail and then coming down on a mountain bike trail called Otter Pop. Tucker had to check out one of the jumps. He ran right up on his own before we got there. Fortunately, he just looked around and didn't try to take the leap! I'm also getting some biking in for a change of pace.",,View Entry,"May 24, Sun",0
