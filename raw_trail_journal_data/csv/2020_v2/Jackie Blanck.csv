Jackie Blanck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582326,"The AT. It has been on my mind for so long. A treck that called to me; even before I first experienced a long distance hike.
There have been plenty of short hikes and even an endurance hike (50km straight through, along with the lead up training). But never multiple days carrying all my own gear.
Two years ago I took the first step; complete a multi-day hike, just in case I didn't like thru hiking after all. Just 4 days on the The Great North Walk out of Sydney. I stayed near civilisation ""just in case"" and brought along a buddy who volunteered at the last minute. He didn't make it through the 4 days, but I was hooked! 
Next was the Overland Track - 6 days wilderness hiking. Carrying everything as there are no resupply options. I loved the solitude during the day and the companionship at the shelters at night. The moments of stunning natural beauty. The sounds of the birds and glimpses of wildlife.
There haven't been many opportunities recently, but on a retreat in November I felt that call stronger than ever. Almost a feeling of desperation, then of deep communion with the bush. That was it! I committed to do it! Not to just dream, but to plan. 
2020 is my year!",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Tue",0
Jackie Blanck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582699,"I know it's early days, but I'm already agonising over gear.
When I hiked the Overland Track my base weight was a smidge over 22lb. Starting weight was 31lb 10oz including 6 day's food and 2l water. While the weight was fine for a six day trek, it was clear that losing some weight would make the whole experience more enjoyable and less tiring. Especially on the double down day, exhaustion took over toward the end.
So I've been working on lightening the load.
Pack - switched from my old Kathmandu backpacking pack (as in hitch-hiker backpacking; not thru hiking) to an Osprey Exos 58 - 4lb less
Tent - switched from my son's old high school hiking tent to a Big Agnes Copper Spur - both for weight and for ease of exit and entry. Crawling in/out of the old tent was difficult, I'm not as flexible as I once was. Love the high roof and high door of the Copper Spur, it is so easy for changing and to step in and out while keeping out of the wet and mud. It is a bit tighter with me and the pack though. - 1lb 3oz shaved off (plus some if I ditch some packing)
Water Treatment - have added in a Platypus water filtration system to replace my bladder and provide better options than just the treatment tabs I had before.Electronics - I've also added in a Renogy Solar Panel - at 10oz it has added to the weight. On the OT there was no phone reception at all and there was no-one to contact when I reached the other end; so the phone was switched off and I used my old camera for pics, with the phone as a back-up when the batteries finally gave out. But the AT will be different (feedback appreciated); I figure there will be times when I'll want to call ahead to a hostel or shuttle service for pickup; and it would be good to be able to keep up with the blogging and not have to carry/use a paper notebook then transcribe. And not to need to find a computer to download pics. Phone can double for a camera too, dropping one more item from the pack. The solar panel will be tested out on the next few hikes and we will see if it works ok.
Everything else is pretty much ideal; but I have added some extra layers and pairs of socks. Cold is my worst enemy, as my Raynaud's will cut my circulation at a moments notice. So I want to ensure I have options.
I'm also reconsidering my sleeping kit. There are lighter weight Klymit options out there now; and I think I'll need warmer than my old Kelty 32 bag.
My base weight is down to 18lb 9oz; but there is still work to do.",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Mon",0
Jackie Blanck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585617,"I'll need to learn how to keep a Trail log as I hike. I like the idea of adding to my notepad as I go, then downloading it onto the site when I get reception. Up until now I've avoided doing any more typing than I have to on my phone. But I need to get past that hurdle and go with the flow. 
So it's only two days until I leave work and head to Arizona. Two days!!!!! I'm so excited. I have all the gear I need, but my packing needs some more work. The stuff sacks and dry bags I used in the old pack are a bit too big and unbalanced for the new pack. I'll experiment a little when I reach Tucson and Chris and I check out each other's gear. We will probably duck into an outfitters to get some extra bits and pieces. And we need to get our food as well. 
I'm starting to regret leaving the tent bag behind. Thinking that having it on the outside would be better, and a bag would give my ultralight tent some protection from being scraped on rocks and branches. But we will see. Every hike is a learning experience. 
So, the plan is a weekend in Tucson, then my sweetie and I will be attending a spiritual retreat before heading out on the trail. Four days to hike the Lanphier Canyon - Blue River loop in the Blue Range Primitive Area, Apache & Sitgreaves National Forests near the NM border. A 31 mile, 4947 ft elevation gain loop. 
So excited and really looking forward to trying out some of my new gear.",,View Entry,"Apr 03, Tue",0
Jackie Blanck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587561,"Arrived in Springerville about 2am this morning and checked into a lovely little hotel with the most comfy bed. Missed hotel breakfast so went to eat at a great little cantina Booger Reds. Highly recommended. And overheard talk about the rattlesnake fire northwest of Blue. After a few checks with the fire fighters that dropped in for breakfast and the rangers at Springerville and Alpine we decided to go ahead with the loop. 
A beautiful (but narrow and slippery) drive through the ranges had us arriving at the trailhead about 4pm. A bit of pack reorganisation and we were off. Found a lovely little camp spot 2 miles up the canyon. Now settled in, listening to the creek flowing nearby and ready for a longer day tomorrow. 
So far gear is good. Pack is nicely balanced and a good weight. Good-to-go meals are great (smoked three bean chilli tonight).",,View Entry,"Apr 16, Mon",0
Jackie Blanck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587569,"Emerged from our warm sleeping bags late at our beautiful camp spot. Breakfast by the creek, filtered water and filled all our bottles. broke camp and were underway at 9:45. 
Walking through beautiful forests with all kinds of flowers, plants and trees. Then the uphill started.  Long uphills with occasional flat spots through alpine meadows. 
By lunchtime we were spent. Took a break at the intersection of #52 and #55 trails. Dropped our packs and took a short detour for water as we weren't sure about the reliability of the  next spring. Franz spring was not flowing but there was good water in the cistern. Lucky my sweetheart has long arms to reach down and fill the bladder. Icy cold water too. 
Saw tracks of wolf and bear along #55 trail. As well as elk and deer scat in the higher parts of #52 trail. 
After some tuna and biscuits we felt much better and knocked off a few more miles, including a long scree and rock downhill switchback. Emerged into a wooded pine valley with evidence of fire damage from years ago. Stopped and set up camp at 5pm and now snuggled up in our tent. No water down here but we have enough to last to blue river if the next water source is dry.",,View Entry,"Apr 17, Tue",0
Jackie Blanck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587570,"Today was not a fun day (most of the time)
We broke camp and started out at 9:30. Shortly past our camp site was a mud flat and watering hole that were bone dry. Heaps of animal tracks though. Elk, deer, cattle, horse. 
It wasn't long before we were out of the forests and started the first of many hellish descents. Scree slopes abounded. And if it wasn't scree it was loose rocks. The scariest part was a narrow track above a long drop off. There were several wash outs with a very narrow sloped scree trail. One slip and you're gone. We took those few hundred feet VERY carefully. 
The trail was poorly marked in many places and we had to double back a few times. 
After long slow miles we were running out of water and had to ration. (Thank goodness we took the detour yesterday or we would really have been in trouble). We finally made it to the beautiful Landron spring. it was flowing well over 10 gallons per minute so we filled up everything and drank several litres.
The walk down Landron Canyon was pretty. Then we struck Blue River and, after swapping our boots for sandals (we must have forded the shallow river about eight times), walked about an hour upstream before settling on a grassy spot above the river to camp. 
Met a nice cowboy called Dillon passing our campsite. He was out on his horse with two dogs catching wild cattle. He had a busy day; roping and hobbling 17 head. The first person we had seen since setting out. 
Time to turn in.",,View Entry,"Apr 18, Wed",0
Jackie Blanck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587571,"last night, just after dusk, there were large animal noises outside our tent. Not sure whether they were friend or foe we did not peek out. Morning revealed fresh elk and deer tracks on the river edge right in front of our tent. What a pity we didn't poke our heads out to look. Shortly after breaking camp we ran into a couple of regular Blue Range hikers - Dan and Greg from Michigan. They were heading down river to the HU-Bar Ranch. Normally they don't see anyone on their hikes, but this time they had lost their favorite camp site to another couple, and then noticed our campsite just downstream of their second choice. It was a very busy day. We enjoyed the hike upstream  criss crossing the river and repeatedly seeing fresh elk and deer tracks. And my first ever beaver dam.After about 5 miles we emerged at the end of the approach road at the cowboy camp that Dillon and his mate had established.  We took Dan and Greg's advice to drop our packs (thank goodness) and proceeded to walk the 10 miles back to our car.I had thought this would be a hike along the river, but no --- we were up and down hills hoping for a passing pickup to give us a lift. No luck. There were only five vehicles, all travelling in the opposite direction.  Exhausted we finally arrived at our starting point and drove back to pick up our packs. It was a great shake down hike. Very challenging. Anyone considering this hike must be prepared. We had maps and also used AllTrails to check we were on track. Water is scarce and the terrain is very difficult in many places.",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Thu",0
Jackie Blanck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598656,"After receiving my brand new REI Magma 17 sleeping bag a trial run was inevitable. 
Winter in Australia is short and not very cold, so a planned July trip to Melbourne was an ideal opportunity. Time was short and, although I had completed some research, I felt somewhat under-prepared when heading out on this hike. I had been flip flopping between two trails, a safer alternative west of Melbourne on Beeripmo Circuit, or heading up to Baw Baw.  General opinion was that Baw Baw was a better test for the AT; but while there was plenty of info out there about skiing; there wasn't much about hiking. 
Flying into Melbourne late Wednesday night; Thursday morning was a rush to get last minute items - hire an EPIRB (as I was alone and in unfamiliar alpine territory), fuel, food, a decent beanie (my last beanie purchase had been a fail; constantly slipping up off my ears). Then the drive out to the start, stopping in Erica to pick up the mandatory snow chains. 
""You will need snow shoes."" - what? I had never even seen snow shoes; let alone hiked in them. Dixie never used snow shoes, why would I need them? Deciding that local knowledge was worth something; I hired a pair of Yetis as well.
""Mt Erica camp ground? That's not a good road, the locals use it, but I don't recommend driving up there in your little car."" OK, so my plan to camp at Mt Erica then hike to Mt St Gwinear and back was dashed. How about Mt St Gwinear? ""Oh yes, that road is fine."" ""Is it sealed?"" ""No, it's about 15km once you get off the sealed road.""    Hmmm, the rental car company said ""properly constructed roads"" only. I'm here now, I'll risk it.
""Oh, by the way - the staff at Mt St Gwinear leave about 3:30pm - they probably won't be there when you arrive - the road is narrow, watch out for cars coming down from the car park and make sure you lodge an intent form."" OK - time for me to get moving.
There were a few families still at Mt St Gwinear the kids insisting ""just one more"" toboggan slide. The staff had all left, but the amenities building remained open; so I grabbed my gear and headed over to use the facilities, change into my hiking gear and fill my water bottles. Damn; the staff have turned off the water, I should have filled up in town - here I am at 4:30pm with no plan, no camp site and about 8oz water remaining. I had better get moving to find a spot up the trail and maybe find water before it gets dark.
I take a quick look at the map on my GPS and suddenly realise that the trail to Mt Erica does not leave from this car park; it is 7km back on a side road. A quick look at the map up on the board near the cross-country skiing trail and I decide my best bet is to follow the trail up to Mt Baw Baw ski resort village instead. The trail may not appear on my trail app, but it is pole marked and shouldn't get lost. So I lodge my intent form (shoving it into a small gap in the side of the locked box - hope they find it in the morning) and head off.
Strapping on my snow shoes, I head up the cross'country trail, wondering whether I am doing the right thing. As I trudge up the trail I already feel myself relaxing. I may be worrying about camp sites and water, but this feels right. I keep scanning around for possible camp sites the recommended distance off trail, but there are no obvious opportunities. About 45 minutes up the hill I come across a man out camping with his two young sons, he has stopped right alongside the trail on a nice wide flat spot. Its a good thing he has some local knowledge. There's not much within a 15 minute hike, but there is a small site available off a nearby side trail. I go for it, as it's getting dark. 
I find a ""less than ideal"" spot and try to tramp the snow level in my snowshoes. I put up my tent, but how do I stake it in this snow? My stakes just pull out. I'm tired and it's dark, so I stake one side where the snow is firmer and use my hiking pole on the door flap. That will just have to do. Sitting in the doorway of my tent I melt snow and prepare dinner. I'm a little worried about fuel as people have talked about how much fuel is used melting snow; but with only a few mouthfuls left; there isn't much choice. After dinner I put some hot water into my Nalgene for a hot water bottle and put the remaining slightly cooled water into my smartwater bottle. Being worried about the bottle collapsing as it cools I leave it open and put it in a side pocket of the tent. 
Bed time; the area where I have been sitting has now formed a depression and my tent floor is no longer flat - OK, I'll just fill it with my clothing dry pack. My mat has deflated a bit - OK, now to get myself and everything else off it; gee there's not much room in here; reinflation complete; everything back into place; slide into my sleeping bag with my hot water bottle, water filter bag and electronics. OK - lights out. I'm still sliding into that depression which is now all the way along the side of the tent, so I move things around in the dark, reshuffle the mat to cover things and then; a plasticy popping noise - the water bottle!!!! I sit bolt upright and move as far away from where I think it landed as I could (don't want that sleeping bag getting wet). I had left the lid open and my uncoordinated machinations have ejected the water bottle from the side pocket and (upon relocating my head torch) I discover the entire contents are now in all the indentations of my sleeping mat. Lamenting the waste of water (and fuel) I spend the next 15 minutes mopping up it all up with my camp towel. 
Finally cleaned up I settle in for the night and have a restless sleep. This is definitely NOT a comfortable camp site. 
Next morning I look out upon fresh snow; about 1cm has fallen overnight and it lightly coats my tent and everything around me. It is so pretty with the sun shining on the trees up the hill and the sparkling snow. Breakfast time, and some more snow melting as I have no idea whether there will be water further uptrail. I do consider going back to the car park; but dismiss that idea as I have no idea what time they will turn the water back on. So I head on up the trail.
Snow shoeing; I am now hooked. The countryside was beautiful as I followed the trail. After an hour or two I summitted Mt St Gwinear then continued on toward Mt Baw Baw. After the summit the trail was much less traveled. Lucky someone had passed through on skis several days earlier; I followed the marker poles; but sometimes the next marker was out of sight and the tracks helped to determine direction. The finding of a mountain stream was a blessing and I filtered and filled my bottles. There was no-one else out on trail that day and I enjoyed the peacefulness and solitude. 
Reaching the outer loop trail at Mt Baw Baw I was debating whether to hike the extra couple of km into the village; or to stop at a snow covered picnic table I found alongside the trail. Not wanting to set up camp in the dark I opted to do the early turnaround, lunching at the picnic table, then heading back. On the way back I must have picked up the pace because before I knew it I was back at the summit. It was only 3pm; I would be back at the car park before dark and it was too early to stop.
I slowed down, walked some side trails, and found a beautiful little spot to set up camp. This time I took off the snowshoes and stomped down every square inch of my tent site; I wanted to be sure it was flat this time. With plenty of daylight the tent was set up correctly with nearby fallen branches broken up and driven into the snow as tent stakes. I sat on the snowshoes outside the tent to cook this time and felt much better about my preparation and set up this time. By 5pm I was fed and all camp chores were complete. It was still light but too cold to be inactive; so crawling into the sleeping bag seemed like the logical choice. It was a long night, much more comfortable, but you can only sleep so much. 
Morning revealed another gorgeous sunny day. I packed up slowly, enjoying the quietness and beauty. 
Only 2 hours back to the car park and my adventure was over. Checked in with the rangers (they did get the intention form) and enjoyed a chat, a hot coffee and hot jam donuts while waiting for the sun to melt the ice from my snow shoes.
Many lessons learnt; but I have proven most of my gear and clothing.
Improvements: Zip-loc bags - make sure you have enough; and replace the one in your ""toilet bag"" immediately after you dispose of your waste. I only had two spares, needing one for a leaking oatmeal packet, one for the other half of my dehydrated meal, then discovering I didn't have a waste bag meant some inconvenient reshuffling.
Sitting pad - Sitting on cold, wet or rough surfaces is no fun when preparing meals, etc. I have since bought a Thermarest Z-Seat Pad which should do the trick.
Clothing - my upper body was fine, but the skin on my thighs and buttocks became really cold and took ages to warm up after I was in my seeping bag. Maybe the sit pad will help, but seriously considering whether there are warmer lower undergarment options. I wore the Macpac Prothermals the entire time (under my hiking pants and while sleeping).
Lighter - I have been using the Swedish fire knife. I like the knife for many reasons. It means not having to worry about accidentally leaving a lighter in my pack when checking it on aircraft, or about forgetting to add it to my pack after I get off the flight. The knife is useful as a knife. BUT the flint is nearing the end of it's life (and I'm still not very good with it) - there were a few times I didn't think I would get my stove lit. Considering alternatives.
Tent - The BA Copper Spur UL1 is very tight. I can fit everything in ok; but it is a real pain when I need to top up my sleeping mat. And I'm not sure how it will go when it's really wet. Not touching the walls, not having anything resting on the walls may be hard to avoid. A big investment, so I'll try this in other situations before I make a decision.
Sleeping mat - reinflation is a bitch, and the cold comes through. But that will be the same with any inflatable. The jury is still out, but I'll stick with it for now.",,View Entry,"Jul 14, Sat",0

Jackie Blanck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607777,"My hiking preparations have taken a completely unexpected turn.
I will soon be moving to Oslo (Norway) for a twelve month secondment. This project should finish in time for the planned start of my 2020 thru-hike.
Best of all, I will be able to get in LOTS of hiking and winter training in preparation, and will have the opportunity to test and finalise all my cold weather gear and layering systems (something that has been difficult to do in Australia, as it just doesn't get that cold here).
The trail network immediately around Oslo is amazing (see pic - walking trails in red). Hikes are accessible by public transport and there is an amazing cabin network (most of which are only open in winter). Norway has also formalised Allemannsretten (All man's right) in the Outdoor Recreation Act of 1957 which honours the access and right of passage through uncultivated land, regardless of ownership. This means camping is permitted on any uncultivated land for up to 2 nights, provided it is more than 500ft from a dwelling and that ""due care and consideration is shown"".
I am looking forward to spending many of my weekends hiking, snowshoeing and skiing.
I'll be starting a new journal for all my Norwegian adventures (http://www.trailjournals.com/Ozzie2019NOR/).",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Fri",0
Jackie Blanck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626579,"HIKING PLANS UPDATE
My work in Norway has been changing radically over the last few months. One minute I will be fully occupied for all of 2020; the next minute I'll have months to spare. Two months ago we definitely had testing scheduled for June; now it looks like it may not be until September or later.

So I've announced that I am definitely going to hike the AT!!!!
I may not have time for the entire thru-hike; but my estimates indicate that it is doable. And it is quite possible that testing will be pushed out even further.
My fiancee (newly acqured since my last post) is fully supportive of my hike. 

Start date: late May (exact date to be finalised)
Start location: Harpers Ferry or Duncannon 
I'll be somewhere between the Flip flop festival starters and the bubble. Not ideal, but starting further north gets so much harder. Any suggestions are welcome.

So I'm starting the last minute plans:
- US Visa submitted (interview next week)
- Travel insurance provider locked in (very difficult as an expat)
- Airfares look good (less than USD500 return from Oslo to Washington)
- Ramping up fitness training and more weekend hikes


Looking forward to getting out on the trail.(Photo added from one of my local hikes)",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Wed",0
