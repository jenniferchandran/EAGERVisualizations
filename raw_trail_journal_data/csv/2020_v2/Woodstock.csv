Hello dear reader....
My name is Cecil and I'm preparing to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail starting in April of 2020. 
I've lived most of my life below Interstate 10 and I don't care for cold weather. So, I'm beginning my hike later than normal and I'm starting in the middle of the trail, at Front Royal, Virginia. I'll head north for the next few months until I reach Mt. Katahdin in Baxter State Park, Maine. Hopefully by Aug 1st. I'll then hitch back down to VA and resume hiking southbound to Springer Mountain, Georgia. This approach is called a Flip-Flop and is still considered an official Through Hike. My goals are numerous but one of the most important is finishing in under 6 months. It's said you should plan for 5-6 months, so I'd expect to be done around October 1st. However, life happens, and I'm prepared to push my finish to the end of October. However, regardless of where I'm at, I'm leaving trail to be home by Halloween. Again, I don't like the cold. 
Alas, this year, 2019, has been full of anticipation and preparation. My gear is 99% complete and I'm itching to get on trail. Tomorrow it'll be 2020 and I can officially say: I'm hiking the AT this year!",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Tue",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625541,"It was 20 years ago today...
... I woke up the morning after the dreadful Y2K disaster which was supposed to set modern civilization back to the caveman days. Obviously, however, the computers didn't crash and we all went about our lives. But the year of 1999 was full of doom and gloom for everyone and it was completely depressing. So, when I woke up that New Year's morning in the new millenium, I promised myself since we'd all survived Y2K I was going to do a thru hike. Back then, I had a friend who was preparing for a thru-hike of the PCT, so I credit her for giving me the long hike itch. I was in complete awe of the amount of training and preparation she invested into that endeavor. Dropped out of school, sold her house and possessions, rented a storage unit for the few things she kept, and off she went. Alas, she found love on the trail in Oregon, married, and settled on a farm in the Pacific Northwest. Her story was amazing and still inspires me to this day.
My AT dream lived inside my mind for the next several years. I hiked now and again, camped a lot. But life and career didn't allow for a 6-month absence. That is, until I retired from the military. I served 25+ years and retired in 2012. But I immediately began my second career...stay-at-home-dad. Our son was born the same day I took off the uniform for good. Couldn't have planned it any closer. So, with no break in service, I became a domestic engineer and raised Patrick while mom continued to bring home the bacon. Eventually, the baby became a toddler and then a grew into a little boy who eventually started school. And suddenly, Dad had his days off! And the itch (the dream) bubbled up to the front of my mind, thumping like the beat of Jumanji. 
Then, in the summer of 2017, my wife went off to school to complete an in-residence Master's program, leaving me and Patrick home alone for 10 months. It was halfway through that experience that I decided to set the date for my AT adventure to happen in the year 2020. Patrick would be old enough to understand what I was doing, and to carry his own weight, and help Mom out in my absence. 
After Mom came home in the Spring of 2018, it was time for me to bring my dream into the physical world. And after much deliberation about timing, I settled on a Flip-Flop Thru-Hike beginning in April of 2020. The date for my hike was set! 
My dream materialized on August 17, 2018. That was the day Amazon delivered my first piece of gear...new hiking shoes! As a runner I know the importance of proper footwear, so I started there, at the bottom. All my backpacking gear was 20 years old, so every single item needed updating. Thus, I've spent the last 18 months researching the trail and acquiring gear. 
Today, the first day of 2020, the year I'm to hit the trail, I'm 95% ready. My gear is all set. My trail planning is done. I have a hostel reservation for my start date. As I wait for winter to pass, I have only a few preparations left: build my hiking body as much as Florida will allow, dial in my trail food, and continue to shakedown my gear. My fully loaded pack currently sits at 33 pounds with water and 4 days of food. This includes a couple extra pounds of cold weather clothes. Initially, my goal was to keep my pack under 30 lbs, so I'm hoping to find ways to shed a few pounds before I step off. But I'm also not terribly worried about that. If it happens, great, but it's not necessary. 
Goodbye 2019...

Welcome 2020!

Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625551,"Whelp...after taking the holidays off from training, I jumped back in today. Did an mild 4-mile neighborhood walkabout. I loaded up all my gear, 4 lbs of water, and 8 lbs of food. A FULL PACK WEIGHT of 32 lbs. Oy! It was hard going following the break. My hips didn't like the pressure points. My legs are screaming at me now. And my right little piggy toe got a wicked hot spot. A full day's hike would certainly have resulted in a blister on most of that toe. It wasn't the socks, it was a rub on the side of the toe box. I'll be trying out different shoes next time. I've got some Solomons I want to test. The good news is that my clothing feels perfect. That is to say, my shorts and t-shirt are great. Not wearing much else in 70 degree Florida sunshine. 
I'd never trained with a full pack weight before. I've always left off the food weight and gone about with around 22-24 lbs. So I quickly realized how exceeding 30 lbs is a world of difference. I desperately want to keep my pack under 30#. Considering I'm starting off with a couple pounds of winter clothes and I packed 5-days of food, that's the absolute maximum my pack should ever be. But still, I hope to find some room to shed before I head out. A wise man once said: ""It's easy to fill a pack with 80 lbs of lightweight gear."" The struggle is real. 
So, I added my food bag to my pack and stuck with the advice of putting it on top--easy access throughout the day. However, I immediately realized that 8 solid lbs at head level throws the balance off to a dangerous degree. I could barely turn or shift my weight without being swung about. So, I put the food (my heaviest bag) at the bottom. And that solved the balance issue. But, it puts the good stuff way out of reach AND it gets absolutely crushed under the weight of everything else. So, I'm still stuck experimenting with pack management. Alas, that's why we train, n'est pas? 
Anyway, the attached pic is from a beach visit yesterday (New Year's Day). The sunshine felt good and it's obvious where my mind is...",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Thu",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625631,"Back in high school I chased a girl who happened to run track. And one day she convinced me to have a tryout with the team’s track coach. I was very athletic but running was for, well, I was young and dumb. Anyway, just like in the movie, Grease, I tried out for track & field to impress a girl. And just like Danny, I didn’t have a clue what the hell I was doing. But I was fast and it turns out I could jump like a horse. Thus began my running life. Oh, I never got the girl. But I continued running for the next 35 years, without pause and without injury. That is, until October 6th, 2017. That year I'd entered a 1,000 mile challenge to log all those miles in one calendar year. And I was doing great....But on that fateful October day I was hammering out a mindless 6-mile morning jaunt when I stopped to take a selfie with one mile left. I stopped there to capture mile 800 of the challenge. Certain that I had this challenge in the bag. Alas, after that pic, I sauntered along and about 50 steps later I felt a tap on the back of my lower right leg. It was like someone had slapped me with a cane or a branch had jumped up and hit me on the calf. It didn’t hurt right away but it was quite noticeable. Whelp, a few steps later, the pain set in. And that was that. Turns out, I’d torn my calf muscle. I limped on back home and began the 6-month healing process that is required with this type injury.  
So...Here I was, only months away from turning the big Five-Oh! Thousands of miles on my body. Countless running races accomplished. Never a problem. I figured I’d be back on that galloping horse in giddy up time. Unfortunately, tho, that didn’t happen. For the next 27 months I didn’t run another mile, not another step. My body healed itself up and haired over but my running mojo was dead. However, what did live loud and proud was an endless stream of excuses—one after another. Then, my dream of hiking the AT got going and I began rucking (walking with a weighted pack on). I told myself I didn’t want to start running again so as not to risk injury leading up to the big adventure. But I wasn’t satisfied walking. As a runner, walking is pure hell.
Then, the New Year rolled over. Hell, it’s a whole new DECADE! And there’s no way I’m going another year without running. So, today I ended the 2+ year drought. I spooked that old horse out of the barn today and hopped right up on that mare. She’s old, a little heavier, and a lot slower. But she’s still there for me. I lumbered through 3 ugly miles on an absolutely beautiful day. I dreaded each step but I now savor the result. I won’t call myself a runner again, yet. I still want to avoid injury. So the going will remain slow and easy. I just want to build some strength and stamina; not looking win any races.
So that’s my New Year's resolution. 
I haven’t been a runner for over 2 years now. 
But that changed today, dammit!",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Tue",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625641,"Woodstock, New York, is an iconic location. Such that, I'm determined to visit there during my hike. It's a bit of a hitch from trail, but I'm going!

So...while plotting my rendezvous, I decided to see if there were any other Woodstock towns in the country. I certainly haven't heard of any other than NY. So a quick search revealed there are, in fact, EIGHT towns named Woodstock. Now, you say, that's not noteworthy, right? Well, as it turns out, 5 of them are along the AT. What?? Yah. And each one is quite easily accessible with just a bit of hitching. Furthermore, the 6th town is in north Georgia, just a hair south of the trail's starting point. I know, crazy right? And yet another is in Alabama, just outside of Birmingham. But what does Alabama have to do with the AT???

Well...it comes as a surprise to most people that the original concept of the true southern terminus of the AT by its creator, Benton MacKaye, was to eventually be Birmingham. This is because the Appalachian Mountain Range extends down to central AL. In fact, there exists now a path called The Pinhoti Trail which hopes to one day extend the AT about 350 additional miles to (near abouts) Birmingham. Thus, connecting Springer Mtn, GA to Flagg Mtn, AL. It's a long story, but there has long since been a movement to officially connect the Pinhoti to the AT--relocating the southern terminus to Flagg Mtn. This would make the AT around 2,500 miles long. But since the AT is a Scenic NATIONAL Trail, it's governed by Congress and changing it to such a degree requires legislation. And guess who doesn't want to lose its claim to the ""start"" of the AT? Yah, Georgia doesn't. So...politics. Oh, and your trail purists would have a kanipshin fit. Ironically, since its creation in 1937, the AT has altered 95% of its original path. Yep. That's right. The trail has evolved. Anyway, I digress. 
Thus...SEVEN of the EIGHT towns of Woodstock in this country are in the Appalachian Mountains. All easily within striking distance of an AT thru-hiking, Woodstock-obsessed nutjob. BTW, the eighth town is near Chicago, so that's an outlier. 
If you've bothered to reach this point, thanks for following along. Update to post...I just found out there's a town called Woodstock just 100 miles from Katahdin in CANADA! Well, well, well. It all makes sense now.",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Wed",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625699,"It's hard to believe this picture was taken over 8 yrs ago, BC (Before Child). We spent Thanksgiving in 2011 camping at The Amicalola Falls campground. Yah, it was cold. We joined another couple who were celebrating their wedding anniversary. Obviously some cool outdoorsy peeps who go primitive camping for their special occasion. Anyway, one of the days we humped up to the AT trailhead on top of Springer Mountain. I don't remember the distance from the Lodge to the top but it was a full day's hike up/down again. Gorgeous views tho! Well worth the trip. My wife and I were newlyweds at the time, both active duty military, and our future was wide open. So, dreams of thru hiking the AT were too far off to consider. But I KNEW it would happen eventually. I was at the end of my 25-year career and I was hoping to make some sort of plans. As fate would have it, tho, our son was born the following year and that was that. The dream had to wait. But that was fine. 
Today, tho, my AT thru hike countdown date just hit 99 days remaining. I'm officially down to double digits. It seems surreal when I think about it. Just over a few months off. A few full moons away. I'm trying not to over glamorize the whole thing; trying to keep my feet on the ground. There's a ton of stuff left to tidy up before I launch. 
And then, of course, there's the potential for failure. Yes, I said the ""F"" word. To not hike all 2,200 miles is a failure in my opinion. Nothing against those who have tried. Anyway, I'm also not going to overlook the fact that I statistically have about a 1-in-5 chance of completing the entire trail. And at my age, I'm probably even less likely. So, I'll try to balance reality and fantasy as the countdown continues. It's hard to imagine the anxiety when the calendar turns to April. Those last couple weeks are unimaginable.  
Alas, this morning I woke up with a wicked head/throat situation to commemorate AT-99 day. I feel like absolute crap. So, no training today despite the perfect Florida weather. Good day to stay in and watch the NFL playoff games. 
Good news, tho, I managed a sweet 6-mile walkabout yesterday with my pack at 30 lbs. Everything felt good and I had a wonderful trip. Manged to get some good miles on my Solomon hiking boots. I'm breaking those in for the tougher parts of the trail. I recently read an article about how quickly the trail turns rough above Harper's Ferry, where I'm basically starting. So I'm going to analyze that and see if maybe I should go ahead and start out in the boots. Also, yesterday I received my Hoka Stinson trail shoes. So I'm going to wear those about for a couple days before training in them. My Altra's are a good fit but I don't care for that zero-drop business. So I'm giving the Hoka's a shot this week. I buy all my shoes used either from REI or online personals. Saves a ton of money and they arrive slightly broken in. I don't mind a little trail dust on my ""new"" shoes. 
Alright, my head is fuzzy, I can't speak, and my throat is on fire. So it's self-medication and football time. Hopefully I can stay awake for two straight playoff games...",,View Entry,"Jan 11, Sat",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625737,"Sharing my struggle with footwear...
As a lifelong runner, I pay close attention to my feet and the affect shoes have on my body. It's why I mentioned earlier that my very first gear purchase for this thru hike was a pair of trail shoes. 
I'd done the research on AT footwear and the vast majority consensus was the mighty Altra Lone Peaks (front row, left). I've got probably 50+ regular wear/walking miles on them now but only about 20 backpacking miles. My body (particularly my Achilles tendons) simply do not like zero-drop platforms. I can walk all day in them but put some weight on my back and I'm toast in 2 hrs. So, I tried some heel inserts to fabricate a drop. But that was too wobbly. Alas, my 3.5's are relegated to the back of the closet only to be pulled out for day hikes or trail runs. But no rucking. Fortunately, I got them on a great sale. 
Next, I fell back on my military service where I wore combat boots (front row, center) every day for 25 years. I've even done a trail marathon in combat boots. Yes, they feel magnificent and can handle the weight with no problem. But as they say, one pound on the foot is five pounds on the back. Plus, when wet, they weight about 10 pounds and take forever to dry. Alas, my old trusty boots got the boot.
Then one day, I read the story of Grandma Gatewood and how she thru hiked in Converse Chuck Taylors. Holy crap, was I excited. I've been wearing Chux since looong before they were fashionable (over 40 years now). I wore them because they were cheap and did the job. I actually have 5 pairs of them in various colors. So as a tribute to Emma, I was adamant about doing the entire hike in them. So I replaced the insoles with some custom soles and gave them a whack. I actually put probably 50 miles on them with the backpack. And they felt great. But try as I might, they too are zero drop and my legs just won't take too much pounding like that. Also, the rubber bottoms are simply too slick. 
Next, I reached into my closet and pulled out my tried and true Merrells (back row, left). I've hiked and walked countless miles in these since discovering them 20 years ago, they feel amazing and they last forever. Unfortunately, they also weigh a ton! And weight on the feet matters, so good as they feel, I had to move on. 
So I went back and did some more research. Seems like everyone just loves and gloats over their Solomons. I managed to find a used pair at REI in my size and got them super cheap. And yes, they fit like a glove and hugged my tootsies like nothing else. However, as is the problem with Solomon's, they're too narrow in the forefoot or footbox. My feet are guaranteed to spread out a bit after all those miles and pounds, so with absolutely no room to wiggle, I can't safely depend on these. I'll keep them for a backup though in case I have to send for them. 
My next pair also came cheap from REI used gear. I decided to check out hiking boots. I want a pair for the tough and rocky spots in the northeast, so I went a half size larger (1.5 over my normal size) in Solomon Hiking Boots and was rewarded with a very good feeling trail boot. These will be my go-to for boots. Got lucky on the first try there. 
Finally, I took a chance on a pair of Hoka Stinsons. Hoka fans are very loyal to their brand and say the best things about them. So when a guy offered up a $160 pair of shoes for just $30 in my size, I jumped on them. They arrived this past weekend and I've only worn them a bit. Haven't rucked in them yet. But holy cow, do they feel amazing! The soles are super wide and ultra cushioned. My feet sit snug and I feel like I'm walking on clouds. These babies are certain to be the winner, winner. Can't wait to get some pack-miles on them. 
Whelp...that's my 17-month journey to find the right AT thru hike shoes. Thanks to on-hand inventory and buying used, I'm less than $200 in the bag. Hopefully I can get many miles on the Solomon Boots and Hoka Shoes before starting my hike and jeopardizing my success. The horror stories are enough to make you cry.",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Mon",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625910,"Did my first real full shakedown this holiday weekend. It was only a two-day, one-night affair with 19 miles traveled. Didn’t go anywhere, just walked out the front door to a nearby place and pitched camp then walked back home. Made the first day longer, with 12 miles, and 7 miles the second day. It’s Florida, so the going was sea level, flat, and mostly urban. Not exactly a true comparison to the trail but it’s a start. I chose these particular days because the temps were “cold” for a Floridian. I won’t get into how cold, just that it was not comfortable…at all. 

   So, it was very odd walking out the door with my pack on. This was it, man! Everything I’m to live with for 6 months is on my body. I was anxious and nervous thinking that soon I’ll be doing this for real. And there’s no explaining how much is going thru your head when you walk out the door for a half-year journey with almost nothing. My mind was going over every single piece of gear and clothing. I was certain I was forgetting something. Right? Too much of something? Not enough? Is my food right? Oy! What a mess.    I put my pack on the scale just before stepping out. It weighed right at 25 pounds with water and 2 days food. I couldn’t believe it. I’d gone from 35# down to 30# and now I’m at 25! Naturally, I’ll be a bit heavier pulling out of towns with a 4-5 day food supply, but not by very much and it gets lighter fairly quick. The pack felt like a feather and I was quite pleased. The miles flew by with nary a hitch. Alas, I couldn’t stop myself from wondering…If 25 lbs feels this good, imagine how amazing 20# would feel? Ah, weight loss envy. It’s a mental disease. I’m going to try to contain this urge and go with what I got. Once summer kicks in, I can drop a few pounds easily. 
LESSONS LEARNED: 
1) My Hoka trail shoes are freakin amazing! No hot spots or pain. So glad that search is over. Next over nighter will be in my Salomon boots.2) The shorts, t-shirt, long sleeve base shirt, and hat are perfect. 3) You really don’t eat as much on the go as you think you will. 4) My water system is just right with 2 smart water bottles (700ml) and the Sawyer filter. One bottle is for clean water only. The other is for mixing electrolytes only. That way, only one has sugary residue and smells that the critters like. So it goes in the food bag at night. I also have a CNOC “dirty” water bag for scooping water and filtering into the plastic bottles. I see a lot of ppl screwing the Sawyer directly onto a bottle and pulling off the Sawyer. I don’t like that but maybe it’ll prove more efficient. So my mind’s open. 5) My Marmot tent is da bomb! It sets up smooth and allows dry setup in the rain. I didn’t get rain but steady, solid wind the entire evening and overnight. Not a worry. Plenty of room inside for me and all my gear. Gear-hang points all over the roof. Nice corner pockets for electronics. Two vestibules, which are critical. One for shoes/pack cooking (rain/wind). The other for entry. And if the winds shift, just switch out. 6) My kitchen worked perfectly. The MSR stove, Toaks pot, long-handle spoon are great. I will, however, add a plastic fork for spearing noodles (aka, Ramen). Hard to get those slippery suckers on a spoon.7) My sleep system was adequate. It took about an hour to heat up the bag and tent with my body/breath. It got real cold, real fast once that sun disappeared. If you ain’t fully setup and done with dinner by sundown, it’s not fun doing any of that in the cold and dark. Couldn’t imagine adding rain into that mix! So, pushing your mileage too close to sunset is not advisable. Anyway, I’m using a quilt and it’s fine temperature wise. But I need to get the bungy straps for going around the pad to keep it in place. My Big Agness sleeping pad is huge and heavy but, damn, it’s good sleeping. My inflatable pillow is great because it has a strap for the pad and also has rubber nubs on one side to grip the pad. My pillow doesn’t budge. Because it was cold, I used my puffy jacket for extra loft and warmth. But, I drool. So I won’t be using my puffy as a pillow anymore; unless it’s inside a stuff sack. 8) Due to the cold, I slept in my thermals (called leggings nowadays). I have sleep shorts but I wanted to test the leggings. I actually got too warm with them after a while. But it was nice waking up to the cold with them on. So, to test my convertible hiking pants, I put them on over my leggings and life was great in the early-morning cold. Just enough to stay warm and yet breathable. Oh yah, I had used my wind pants the first day to check them out and they were perfect. But once that wind stopped, they def heat you up. I have the zippered feet, so that helps. Next, I slept in and wore home my mid-layer hoodie. This plus my LS base shirt were just right when you’re moving. But as soon as you stop for a break, it gets cold quick. You don’t realize there’s a slight layer of sweat on your body when you’re working. But it screams out when you stop. Nothing you can do about that. Finally, I tried out my puffy jacket in the early morning while making b’fast and breaking camp. But I quickly got too hot for it once I was active. I never understood how ppl have said they never wore their puffy while hiking (only around camp). But I can relate now. It would have to be in the 20’s for me to hike with a down jacket on. And I’m not expecting much of that nonsense. Oh, my beanie. Yah, it’s a nostalgic fleecy type thing that the military issued me. So I thought it’d be cool to take that. Alas, it don’t cut it. That’ll be getting upgraded before next trip. 9) Pack management! So, I’ve been dividing my crap into nice little bundles and stuff sacking everything. It’s nice knowing that nothing’s going to get wet even in the worst case scenario (water crossing disaster, torrential rain for days, etc.). But it’s a PITA to pack and stuff everything nice and neat in the morning. So, when I started breaking camp, I decided to NOT use a single stuff sack (except electronics and first aid). I opened my pack up and just started jamming everything in there. It was torture because it goes against every bit of my OCD. But I don’t want to leave any stones unturned so I jammed it all in there. Lo and behold, it was a miracle. Truly unbelievable. I had so much extra space after that. I was floored. And sold on the idea. So simple, so quick. And so efficient. Well, now my 55L pack is too big. I never imagined that possible considering the first time I filled it up with 35 lbs. But here it sits fully loaded and doesn’t extend above my lower neckline. Can’t say I’ll get a new, smaller bag. But I’ll give it a couple more shakedowns and make a call. A person can shave an entire pound of weight with a smaller, lighter bag. Just sayin’… 10) Rain gear. Didn’t get to use it. Nor my FAK, fortunately. Oh, and I didn’t use my trowel. I figured people don’t want me digging cat holes in their yard. Other than that, I put everything to the test.    My body held up quite well. No problem setting out for day two after 13 miles the day before. I had a couple hot spots where the pack rubs. I have a broken clavicle, so there’s nothing to be done about that protruding bone which sits directly under my shoulder strap. This may become my Achilles heel. And my right hip was a bit hot. I think I carry my load a bit skewed to keep pressure off my left clavicle. So that’ll have to be monitored. Okay…if you’re still with me this far, congratulations. This does it for my first 100% shakedown. Hoping my next one is a 3-day, 2-nigher over the holiday wknd in February.",,View Entry,"Jan 22, Wed",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626088,"So I'm digging through a closet and I find a stack of old paper maps from way back in the day when we didn't have technology. People carried an Atlas or paper map in their car. Gas stations sold these items on display racks right by the front door. One would pull into a convenience store and actually ask for directions to a place or street. It was ""The good ol' days."" Before we carried computers in our pocket. Anyway, I mentioned in an earlier log that I got the AT itch around 20 years ago. And I saw my first White Blaze in 2004 on a section hike. Well, I found the two maps I used from that visit to Springer Mountain and a bit beyond. They're sturdy and waterproof but lack much detail. The information available 16 years ago was limited to a handful of books and these crude maps. The World Wide Web existed back then but it was still just getting going. 
Preparation in the past was nothing like it is today. Nowadays folks can pretty much hike the whole trail virtually from your computer and never leave the house. In fact, I've been surprised to learn that quite a lot of people follow along with thru hikers on youtube. They pick a suitable person whom they don't know and will likely never meet. Yet, these people have no plans to hike themselves or maybe they can't for whatever reason. They just like being a fly on the wall. Prior to my preparation for this year's Thru, I'd never considered this. In fact, after I got connected with the Web Groups, Blogs, Vlogs, and Youtube channels, I actually got overwhelmed with it all. And I began to feel like I was taking away some of the excitement of what I was going to be doing. There's just so much information out there. I didn't want the trail and its shelters and towns to feel like Deja Vu all the time. So I cut myself off the videos and even stopped reading the books (after about a dozen or so). 
Alas, the countdown to my journey continues. I've got all my gear dialed in and a firm understanding of the trail. Plane ticket to Philly in hand and Greyhound bus ticket to the nearest trail town. I look through these basic maps and can't believe how different my trail preparation has been today compared to way back when. AWOL and Guthook guides are light years ahead of how it used to be. Don't really know if that's a good thing or not though...",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Fri",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626443,"I just spent this past Presidents’ Day wknd in Myakka River S.P. (1.5 hrs south of Tampa, FL), in continuing preparation for my AT Thru Hike this May. I set out for a 35 mile, two night, three day gear shakedown. Wx was going to be hot and dry, so I ditched my winter clothing and some rain gear to lighten the load because there is no reliable water source there this time of year. I was carrying 15 lbs of water to start. 
    Boy, what an adventure. Some of the trail was in thick woods but most of it was in the barren scrub plains surrounded by razor palms and totally exposed to the hot sun. When I did manage to find a water source, I went ahead and tanked up. The brackish water tasted very earthy even after two filterings but if you’ve ever lived with well water, you get used to the color and taste. I had a fun time with one water crossing that was about 20’ across and 4’ deep. Fortunately, just before going in, I noticed a sunken wood footbridge about 12” below the water. And somehow I managed to tiptoe on that narrow, slick boardwalk without falling in. One sure way to die on trail is to let yourself get underwater with 30 lbs of gear strapped to your back. Anyway, it was a good distraction.    A second unexpected adventure was encountering a gigantic hornets nest in the ground right on the trail. The razor palms and scrub were so heavy that there was absolutely no going around this buzzing landmine. And I’ve been attacked by ground hornets before—they chase you for about 100 yards before giving up. Alas, I was in shorts and shirt and with my pack, there would be no outrunning a pissed off collective of stingers. So I pulled out my rain jacket (glad I brought it) and wind pants, donned a buff around my face, put my hat on my head, and curled my bare hands into my sleeves. Of course, it was the hottest part of the day and it took a bit of time to get dressed up and get my pack secured for the sprint. I was sweating bullets! Anyway, I made the mad dash and didn’t get stung or suffer a twisted ankle or knee in the race. But I’m quite certain I set the WR for 100 yd dash with 35 lbs of on your back.    Camping in the evenings was uneventful. I missed my first campsite due to sunset, so I stealth camped. But the second night it was great. Only wildlife I came upon was snakes, buzzards, coons, and boar. But no crocs or large cats.    Got in some great miles and learned a ton about wild Florida life. Okay, so that’s the adventure until next month...",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Wed",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627596,"We've flattened the curve. It's time to crawl out of our caves. This nation must be FREE! Okay, rant over. 
After a week of all the drama online, I stopped visiting the hiking sites. In fact, two of the main sites I tuned into regularly for the past year were shut down by the Mods. People were getting crazy, then the Mods told them to chill, then they shouted back with ""censorship"" crap. And that was that. It was tragic and just too much to process. So I put my pack in a corner and left it alone. And I suspended most thoughts of The Hike while things went crazy across the globe. Alas, the end of the lock down seems near. 
I've successfully maintained my sanity while remaining socially distant and virus-free (at least I think so). Time to refocus on something positive. My planned start date of 5 May was all but abandoned a month ago. But that may actually be a perfect goal. I've still got a reservation at Amicalola for 4 May. My pack is still ready to go. My life wasn't affected much by the economic impact of the situation. So it seems like I'm back on track. Which puts my takeoff date a mere TWENTY DAYS from now! Less than 3 weeks!! It's a remarkable slap across the face to wake up this morning having to prepare again for this adventure--after basically giving up on the hike altogether for this year. 
Georgia did not shut down its state parks, so beginning the trail is no problem. Yes, the AT starts in national forest, but GA don't care what people do in the woods. And yes, the ATC has technically ""closed"" the AT but that's just for the lawyers. Okay, they may not issue me a registration tag, oh well. Anyway, as I see it, it'll take about a week or so to get into N Carolina where the trail bisects the Nantahala National Forest, eventually hitting the bottom of The Great Smoky Mountain National Park (which is completely closed as I write this). So, if I set out 5 May, I'll hit SC roughly 12 May. That's a month from right now. So I'm banking on things to be returning to normal by then. Even so, most of the SC trail is quite remote. I don't see much reason to be wasting resources by rounding up law-breaking thru-hikers a month from now. Anyway, if all goes well, it'll take another week or so to reach The Smokys. So that puts me there toward the end of May. I'm fairly certain things will be cleared up by then. But as a backup plan, I can shuttle around The Smoky's and come back to it in the end or even bang it out next spring. As long as I get the whole trail done in a 365 day period, technically it's still a thru hike. 
The entire northeast is pretty much off limits at the moment. So I'm rolling the dice hoping that as I wander north things will slowly open up ahead of me. I'm not planning to hit the top half of the trail until Mid-July. So, hopefully life will be back to normal by then. And if it isn't and I have to cut my hike short, it won't kill me. It'll be difficult but I can come back next year and knock out the rest. It won't earn Thru-Hike status, but I'll have done the whole thing. And maybe if I have to come back I'll bang out the remaining miles and then go ahead and finish off the rest. Maybe do it SOBO so it doesn't seem redundant. 
This weekend I'm going to shake off the cobwebs and tackle a trail in western Georgia called the Pine Mountain Trail in the FD Roosevelt State Park. GA state parks are all open! The trail is in a nicely wooded area spanning about 15 miles between two small towns nd it has about 40 miles of trails. I've got a campsite reserved for the whole week. I gotta drive 7 hours to get there but it'll be nice being on the road and out of the house. Technically I may be breaking the law because my county is currently on a mandatory ""Safer At Home"" order. Whatever the hell that means. Also, we started just last night a mandatory 9:00 pm curfew in my city. Nobody knows why. Evidently the virus is nocturnal. Ugh, not even gonna rant again. Anyway, I'm fleeing this Sunday. The current stay home order is in effect until 29 April. So I'm hoping to come home to some loosened restrictions and maybe go to the beach again before heading for the AT on 4 May. Sheesh...20 days. That's crazy talk!
Anyway, this is where I sit today, the day before what would have been Tax Day tomorrow (it's moved to 15 July this year). Gotta have a plan otherwise it's anarchy.",,View Entry,"Apr 14, Tue",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627799,"DROP BOX Hiker term for a package of food that you mail or have someone mail to a place near or on the trail ahead of your pace. There's a handful of places on the trial where this is convenient and many prior thru hikers have a good consensus about where a drop box should be sent. For example, The Smoky Mountain section is about 75 miles with only one option for a resupply in town but it's a huge pain to get off trail into Gatlinburg and back again. Also, it's basically a lost day, expensive, and can be unreliable in bad weather. Another place is The 100 Mile Wilderness in Maine. Resupply in there is possible but most people prefer to go thru that with a week's worth of food. The problem is, the towns at the beginning of these stretches don't have decent trail hiking food supplies. Or you have to shuttle a long way to get to a big box store, etc. So it's wise to send a drop box to certain spots. 
Now, if you have someone at home to gather and ship these boxes for you along the way, that's nice. But if you don't, then you have to do all the shopping and boxing and labeling ahead of time and hope a friend can be counted on to drop the right box at the post office at the right date. It's not rocket science but where you'll be at what time can be hard to calculate. So it's a moving target. That said, all the stuff you put in these boxes must also be able nonperishable. So the mailed resupply boxes aren't 100% complete. If you want fruits, veggies, chocolate, etc., then you still have to get that along the way. Same goes for fuel. Can't ship gas.
These days, the world is still mostly shut down and people are still paranoid about catching a bug. So I'm going to add a few extra drops to the beginning of my hike. This way I can avoid a couple town visits early on. I'm banking on the world crawling out of its shell very soon and if I can keep on the down-low over the next month, then my chances of being harassed by the panic-stricken fear mongers will be reduced. And I won't have to worry about where my next meal is coming from if my planned resupply store is closed or picked clean. 
So, this week has been shopping and preparing my drop boxes. The US Post Office has flat-rate shipping boxes that most hikers use. You pick your location and mail it ahead. The post office will hold it for up to a month, so getting it mailed early is important. The worst thing is getting to a town and having to wait a day or more for your package to arrive. Also, post office hours are not very long, so you have to get off trail and get a ride to town before it closes. Or, if you stay the night waiting on your box to arrive the next day, then you have to wait until they open. For this reason, it's often best to mail the box to a Hostel that's on trail. Most Hostels are very accommodating with thru-hiker mail support. 
I filled up a Wally world shopping cart with ungodly quantities of the breakfast, lunch and dinner packages of stuff that only needs hot water to cook. For my drop boxes, I'm relying mostly on dehydrated ""hiker"" meal packs as dinner entrees. They're a bit costly but there are some niche brands that make really tasty stuff. Naturally, there's a bunch of 22¢ ramen bombs in there too. Tons of various snack bars and about 10 lbs of my private recipe for homemade trail mix. Lunch will consist mainly of tuna or chicken packs rolled into tortillas. It's kinda scary that flour tortillas are good for 4+ months. Breakfast will rotate between oatmeal and cereal bars and of course pop tarts. 
But it's not all bad. Hikers require a lot of calories. But most of the snack bars are semi-healthy. I figure I'll buy all the sugar snacks at convenient stores along the route. No need shipping that stuff. Each box has Nuun tablets for electrolytes and multi-vitamins and a small roll of TP. One box at mile 600 has new shoes. Another has a lightweight down blanket to swap out my sleeping bag in the summer months after the Rocky's. 
So that's it for meal planning! 
Which means......
I AM 100% READY TO WALK OUT THE DOOR

Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627815,"It's GO time, folks....I'm leaving for the trail today. This very day. In a couple hours. It's really happening!
Yesterday was my last day at home and I was a mental and emotional wreck. It was very difficult to think straight and finish up all the last minute details and saying goodbye to friends. The original plan was to have a farewell sendoff this weekend. Alas, that can't happen during these times of trouble. 

Patrick here is my 7-yo little man and I could tell he was stressed too. But he hung in there. He slept next to me last night. Poor kid couldn't go to sleep though. He was up past midnight. There's just no way to adequately say goodbye. And it's hard to explain why I'm leaving him to go do nothing. I retired the day he was born and have been with him 24/7 his entire life. We've never been apart for more than a few days. Our separation will be the most difficult part of this journey for me. But, I waited to do this until he had gotten old enough to cope and to help mom around the house. As with all things in life, we'll have good days and bad. I'm terrible at talking on the phone, so I'll have to step up that game. And I hope my youtube channel is successful in keeping us together along the way. 
I'm fortunate to live just under 500 miles from the trail's southern start. I can make the drive in a day with no problem. Which is what today will be spent doing. I'm renting a car for the one-way trip to a town near Amicalola Falls State Park, where the beginning is. I'll stay in a hotel tonight, drop the car in the morning, and uber from there to the trail head. If all goes as planned, and I summit Katahdin in Maine at the end, I'll hop a flight from Bangor back down to my home town of Tampa sometime before Halloween. I suspect that'll be an emotional day as well. In the meantime there are those pesky 5,000,000 steps in between. The one piece of advise that will be my mantra shall be, ""Never quit on a bad day."" Less than 20% of those who attempt an AT thru hike succeed. Many quit. And they all have their reasons. Many try again the next year or even the next. I've read over a dozen books written by those who succeeded and those who haven't. We'll just have to see how my body and my mind handles it. 
Anyway, there's still lots to do and here comes the sun. So I'll enjoy the creature comforts of home one more morning (hot shower, fresh coffee, loved ones around me). But the minutes are ticking away. 
It's time to go...",,View Entry,"May 03, Sun",0
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627837,"This is it! 
Woke up this morning in a hotel in Dawsonville, GA. Got an Uber to Amicalola Falls and hit the Approach trail at 10:00. Walked every one of those stairs. Took a side step to see The Lodge. Then continued on up...and up...and up. 
Not gonna lie, it was tough and difficult. But I arrived at the official southern terminus of the AT at 4:00. Took my pictures. Signed the logbook. Then stepped past the FIRST white blaze. It's about 100 yards to Springer Shelter from there. So, I'm officially ON TRAIL!
I setup my tent then had conversation with the two other occupants. Mr. Brent from TX is an older fella who resembles Santa Clause. And no-name kid is from Michigan. Brent is a hammock swinger and Kid was fine by himself in the shelter. I chose a flat spot on the highest point I could find. 
After supper and cleanup, I moseyed to my tent about 7:30. Got situated. Phoned home. And started some video editing for my Youtube channel. Turned in at 9:00. 
It was a picture perfect day to hike 9 miles. I had the time of my life. Every step was magical. I'm so glad to be finally on my way. 
Alas, at the stroke of midnight, the rain started dropping. Then it dumped. Then the winds came. Then the lightning. Then the thunder. Then the lightning with the thunder. It was a brutal storm that ripped and howled. Lightning was constant and thunder was deafening. My little tent was put to the test! But I had setup high and dry and staked her proper. After 4 solid hours of storming, everything held up fine. Didn't get much sleep tho. 
So this has been Day One. 9 miles hiked but only 0.2 logged on trail. Tomorrow I break camp and start heading to Maine via The Appalachian Trail. 
PS...Yes, officially the trail is still closed but that's a bunch of horse shit. Not gonna go there.","Amicalola Falls
",Springer Mountain,"May 04, Mon",8.80
Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627843,"I can't believe i'm saying this but last night I slept on the Appalachian Trail. It wasn't an easy night as the sky opened up with wicked storms from midnight to 3. So i lost a lot of sleep. I slept in late tho. Got packed and fed and on the trail at 9:30. At the intersection I looked both ways along the trail. To the left was the way I'd come and all the comforts of home, I could easily turn that way and get back to life. To the right was my new life, the reason I was here. I stopped and pondered, literally at a crossroad. Do I really want to do this? I wasn't expecting that reaction. But the doubt soon passed and I was on my way north. The weather was perfect and my spirits were high. Afterall, this was the true Day One of the journey. Everything else was just in preparation for this moment.
Anyway, descending Springer was tough. The angle was steep and the rocks were plentiful and slippery. I had my nose to the ground that first mile. No damn way was I going out on the first mile! Once I got down, the going was much nicer and the sun started to pop out. I soon foud myself in a lush forest with soft dirt under my soles. The going was nice and I came upon a shelter a few miles later. Very nice place right on a large creek. I stopped for a snack and signed the logbook. Then set out for some incredible trail. The green tunnel did not disappoint. At around mile 5 or so I took a jaunt to Long Creek falls and lingered there a bit. Soaked my weary feet in the cold water. Bathed a bit. Took some great pix. Left feeling clean and refreshed. 
Storms were predicted to move in late this afternoon, so I decided to skip lunch and cut my day short at just 8 miles at Hawk Mtn Shelter. Alas, skipping lunch was not wise. Around 2:00 I started to crash and I had to ascend Hawk Mtn. It was a rough last 1.5 and a lesson learned. Don't skip lunch, especially when breakfast was a pop tart. Anyway, I cruised in ahead of the rain and quickly setup camp in the shelter rather than tent. The place is all mine, so I decided to give shelter life a try. As such, I sit by myself with a full stomach and time to rest up. 
It's full on storming again right now. The lightning is popping down all around me. I'm so glad to be high and dry. Tomorrow, however, is supposed to be another great hiking day. 
It's only two days into trail but I can already see patterns developing, rhythyms. I can tell the secret to success will be going with the flow of how your body is responding to the conditions and terrain. My mind is still abuzz from the sheer magnitude of what I'm doing, so I don't have feelings of lonliness or boredom. At least not yet, I'm sure that'll come. Right now I'm completely focused on the body. I need to listen for the signs of over use and exhaustion. Both of which are hard to recover from once it's too late. I had significant muscle cramps last night in the tent. It was hot on the hike and the climb was tough, so my legs were smoked. And I paid for it after I'd stopped moving. I was worried I'd be stiff and sore today but fortunately I woke up feeling good. A result of the exhausted leg muscles was lactic acid buildup. I had to urinate four times in the night as my body was excreting the toxins. Today I made a point to drink often and add in electrolytes. And tonight, I'm sitting here feeling great. I have no signs of cramps and I don't feel sore. My trail legs are slowly coming along. 
My first resupply is coming up at Neel Gap, in 22 miles. I'd really like to do a pair of 11 mile days to get there. That's asking a lot but with today's long rest and an early start tomorrow, I may be able to stretch out 11. It won't be a big deal if I don't. I can do a couple 9's and roll into Neel early in the day instead of getting in late and tired after an 11 mile day. My food is good enough to support either plan. 
Well, that's it for the official Day-1. It's still very much not real. I'm still in the mindset that this'll be over soon, like any other vacation or trip. At some point, my mind has to accept that this is my life now. I'm actually living in the woods. There's nothing else. I suppose it'll become necessary to detach almost completely from my former life and focus on this new one...","Springer Mountain

A lot of hostels offer this. They hold your gear while you hike with just a day pack and drop your gear off with you at an intersection at the end of your hiking day. So you hike all day long with just water and snacks. Or in my case, you check in to the hostel for a night or two and you juat leave your gear in your room while you day hike. They drop you at trail in the morning and pick you up at night when you're done. For you, it's an all day hike. For them it's a few miles drive, as their business is generally in the middle of the hiking sections. 
Anyway, I'm in an incredible private room in this wonderful Hike Inn. The owner is doing my laundry. Me and 5 fellow thru hikers got shuttled to town for Resup and dinner takeout.

Made it to the ONE THOUSAND MILES marker! It's actually unbelievably surreal to see that number. I was so happy I threw up my tent right there.","Manassaa Gap

So I had a good hiking day, even in the heat. Alas, today waz back to the old grind and much less motivating. So I cut it short at the amazing Blackburn PATC centet. Gorgeous woodland campground but hiker hut is closed. Still got to tent there. Water, electricity, and s shower! Moxie made me her special Bluberry Milkshake and I damn near died it was so good after a hard, hot day. Later, she brought me dinner leftovers too! Good thing cuz I was too tired and hot to cook. Fell asleep reading...","Tentsite M. 1000.8

Wandered up to Harpers Ferry. Crossed the long and high bridge over the Shenandoah river. Sun was brutal. Then skirted town on trail. Passed the amazing church. Then stopped into a pub for some grub. That was pretty damn cool. After lunch, I headed out of town and over the newly opened bridge over the Potomac and into Maryland. Just like that...another state! 
Trail follows the river for 3 miles then heads up onto the mountain ridge. Ever northward.It was so hot at night that I slept on top of the shelter picnic table!!","Blackburn PATC

I'm afraid of another 6 weeks of this ahead. Anyway, MD put up a shower building and tiny campsite area just for hikers. Crazy! So that was nice. Dahlgren Hiker Park. 
So...the original Washington Monument is on this section of trail. And I took my son Patrick on a day hike here last week during our vacay. Alas, it was extremely emotional for me to rewalk those miles without him. 
Anyway...climbed a decent mountain, finally, and ended up at an amazing viewpoint called Annapolis Rocks. It had a campground too so I stayed there. It's so hot that I slept on the ground, on my sleeping pad. Cowboy style!","Ed Garvey Shelter

Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629464,"Short day cuz of weather. Wicked cell moved in and I got to see a 1-in-a-Zillion sight!! A huge-ass, full-grown tree fell over....directly across the trail....30 feet in front of me! Like, if I hadn't heard the crunching and stopped to look up, I'd be dead right now! No exaggeration. No joke. Real deal. If I'd had earbuds in with music jamming, I'd actually be dead. That was crazy. 
Anyway, I hopped over the carcass, took a picture, and scooted into Pen Mar Park. It's a city park, so no camping. But I wasn't doing anymore hiking in that weather. Sat out the storm there. Ordered pizza from a local joint! Score. Then unlawfully slept in the pavillion at the park. Got to charge my phone too!","Annapolis Rocks Campground

Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629465,"Big 20-mile day in slightly better temperature. Set an alarm to get out of that city park before it opened. Less than a mile later I was at The MASON-DIXON LINE!! That's right...into Pennsylvania I went. How sweet that felt. Picked wild berries the whole way too. 
After that, tho, it waz a long boring day. No offense to PA, but the hiking is so easy that the miles go slow. And the heat makes it dreary.
Anyway, storms rolled in so I hitched a ride a mile off trail to South Mountain Tavern. Spent two hours there eating and drinking beer. Then headed back out. 
Walked thru Caledonia State Park. Wow! Amazing place. Would live to revisit that place. 
Then climbed up a respectable mountain and ended up in paradise!!!!!!! The Quarry Gap shelter can only be understood by going there. It's a professional Hollywood film setting on a mountain top. Even Walt Disney himself would sleep at this fantasy park. I was so happy I stayed there. Without question, greatest shelter on the first half of the AT!!!!!!","Pen Mar Park

PA hiking is easy and enjoyable, just like MD was. But the heat catches up to you. Alas...today is HALFWAY there day! I hit the marker at noon. Shot a video and sent it out on FB. The moment waz very special...1096.5 miles into the woods I have meandered. Crazy. Ending at Ironmasters Mansion was a very nice treat, too. What a magnificient structure and incredible hiker luxury. The grille next door was a saving grace too. I didn't try the 1/2 Gallon ice cream challenge tho. Wasn't happening. But what an amazing day with the greatest start & ending of the entire trail.","Quarry Gap Shelter

Woodstock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629516,"Staying in Ironmasters Mansion is an amazing experience! And touring the ATC Museum is out of this world. It's a small place but they have great artifacts from days gone by on the AT. I really enjoyed seeing the exhibits of actual trail experiences. And they have the actual Katahdin sign that was taken down in 2010. Having experienced such tradition and seeing those who worked so hard to get thru the AT in years past, I was totally reinspired and remotivated. Putting that AT museum in the middle was very smart. Anyway, today was a completely boring trek into Boiling Springs. Leaving the state park where the Ironmasters is turned out to be the best part of the day. Tonight I checked into Lisa's Hostel. She runs a 5-bunk deal in an actual shed in her backyard. It's a ridiculous setup and it was excruciatingly hot. I would have been so much happier in my tent on the trail. Huge mistake.","Ironmasters Mansion Hostel

And Maine is the worst of them. I got a shuttle out of Boiling Springs into Harrisburg and stayed at a HIlton downtown today. Made my plans for getting to Maine. I have a flight tomorrow to Bangor and a bus to the town near The Appalachian Trail Lodge (hostel) that'll be picking me up and taking care of me for my summit. I'll travel all day tomorrow (Sunday) and take a zero Monday to prepare. Then, I have reservations for both Tuesday and Wednesday nights at Katahdin Stream. Weather on Tuesday is looking rough, so I'll zero then if needed. Wednesday looks good for right now. Anyway, things are going to be weird traveling on a plane for the first time during all this nonsense. Not to mention being around so many people all day. Looking forward to getting thru that. Very excited to be getting out of this miserable heat! I had Joanie ship my cold gear up there. That'll be critical.","Boiling Springs, PA
