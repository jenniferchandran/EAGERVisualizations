Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/455835,"Hello fellow hikers. I thought I would go ahead and start this journal now, even though it will be at least 6 years before I hike. Why did I decide to hike the AT? Well, let's see, I love the mountains and I love to hike. When I retire, I plan to not only hike the AT, but also the PCT and CDT. Maybe I will attempt the GDT one day as well. I may even hike Alaska! All I know is I plan to spend my retirement forever hiking.
I started my ""training"" in August 2013 and am up to 14 miles once or twice every weekend with a 27 pound pack. I live in north FL so it's near impossible to find any kind of hills to climb, but I hike on the most ""mountainous"" trail we have, Torreya State Park. I know, not really what I will be hiking on the AT, but hey, it's a start! 
I'm also slowly buying my hiking gear, although most of it will have to be replaced by the time I hit the AT as it is to heavy, but it's great to use for training. Most of my weight right now is from water and I've been adding my scuba weights to the pack as well. I'm hoping to hike the first 100 miles or so of the AT with a friend this fall. If we're compatible hikers, we may thru-hike together. 
I believe I have to have 3 entries before this will show up in the journals. I will try to enter periodically, but not too often as in 6 years I could really have a huge number of Prep entries!
I would love advice from all you vets, so please feel free to send me emails through the guestbook. Also, please excuse any spelling/grammar errors!

Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471961,"I'm still working on increasing weight and mileage for my week long ""training"" hike in October. It's so terribly hot and humid that I just can't seem to hit my goal of 20 miles. The longest so far is 18.64 miles with 30.6 pounds in my pack. Training is actually the easy part of all this for me as I've alway been athletic. The part that worries me most is the planning stage (that's why I've started so many years in advance). I've never been very good at planning and organizing events and I would call this a MAJOR life event. I guess I'm going to have to buy some literature for the planning stage. I've been reading journals and just don't see how all the hikers manage to have their packages timed so well to reach the post office just when they reach the town. I do realize they have trail support. I think that is another worry for me. I may not have trail support on my hike so I may not be able to ship supplies, except for maybe a bounce box. Another thing that makes planning challenging for me is the fact that I don't want to have to be on a time schedule or a mileage schedule. I want to be able to hike as many, or as few, miles each day as I feel like. I will be out there for enjoyment and oneness with nature, not to break a speed or time record. I don't care if it takes me 6 months or more. I do realize there is a time restraint on reaching Mt. Katahdin, but I don't think that will be a problem. If anyone has advice (or a detailed plan from their hike -- LOL) feel free to share. I'm also curious about the safety of the trail for a woman alone. I've even been considering bring a pooch with me for companionship and security (So I'm paranoid, what can I say?). This is all for now. Hopefully I will be making another entry before my training hike!",,Preparation,"Aug 28, Thu",0
Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/473831,"I thought I would tell you about my physical challenges now because I hope I won't be mentioning them at all in the future. I hate to whine and to me complaining about them or trying to use them as an excuse is whining. So I will put them here, and in the future, if anyone feels like I'm whining, please feel free to let me know :-) 
Okay, I'm 50 right now (in 2014) and my body has had a rough time of it. I have had 3 back surgeries and have been told I need another, which I refuse to have. I have arthritis in my back as well as in my knees and my feet don't work like they should. Due to these and other problems (that won't affect my hiking, so I won't mention them), I have about 7 different type of medications I take daily. The only one that concerns me with my hiking is the muscle relaxer. I've been trying to find out if they inhibit muscle strengthening and I've had one doctor tell me yes and one tell me no. So if any of you medical people out there have any research you would like to share, please feel free.
Okay, that's all I'm saying about that! Now on to more important things. I finally made 20 miles last weekend, with a 31 pound pack. I was exhausted! I don't see how all you hikers make 20+ days, day after day. I know you build into it, but still! I congratulate all of you! The thing is, my 20 miles are still not going to prepare me enough for hiking in the mountains. I may be doing the miles, but I'm weak on the hills and I can't seem to get any better. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, unless it's because I can only hike on the weekends. The way I am right now, I will be lucky to hike 5 miles a day in the mountains! Anyone have any ideas or suggestions? I certainly pray that after 6 years of training, I will manage more than that once I start my thru hike.
This entry is number three so I should now be seen by all you wonderful hikers! So send me info, advise, encouragement, or whatever you feel while help me on my way! Oh yeah, I want to thank all the hikers that keep up their journals while they are thru hiking. I can imagine how difficult that it is to spend time writing after a long day on the trail. I am grateful to you all!",,More History,"Sep 12, Fri",0
Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476957,"Well, I'm heading to Atlanta tomorrow to meet up with my hiking buddy to hike the beginning of the AT for 8 days and 7 nights. This hike is to get my feet wet and to see if my friend and I are compatible hikers. I firmly believe in 'Hike your own hike' and if I am going to have a hiking buddy on my thru-hikes, we have to be compatible in most ways. We are starting at Springer Mountain and we hope to get up Blood Mountain then turn around and head back. Retracing our hike is not our first choice, but we can't find any friends that can drop us off and pick us up so we have to hike back to the vehicle.I'm having a hard time whittling my pack contents down to an acceptable weight. I was hoping for 30 lbs with food and water, but I'll be lucky if it's 40 lbs! Part of the problem is that we are having to take 8 days of food as we will not be going into any towns. At 2 lbs a day (which is what I read you should have), that's 16 lbs right there! My pack is not a lightweight at 6 lbs empty (is great for training though!). It's an expedition style pack and I've trimmed some things off of it to lessen some of the weight, but not really a significant amount. I don't have really lightweight items either as it is going to be 5 years before I actually start my thru hike and I don't want to buy the high end stuff now as there will undoubtedly be massive improvements and changes in 5 years. So the dilemma is where to cut the weight. I might be able to cut some water weight when we find out what the water situation is like. But I'm not sure what else. I will go through my pack again tonight and see what I can do. I hope to journal on paper while I'm gone and add entries when I get back, so I will let everyone know how it went.",,First Pre-Hike,"Oct 23, Thu",0
Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477881,"I forgot to take my little notebook, so I didn't get to journal on trail. But even if I had, I probably would not have been too good at keeping it as I was so busy talking Firewolf's ear off! We didn't hike as far as I had hoped and we were only out 6 days. I had originally told Firewolf 7 days and then somehow managed to lengthen it to 8 in my head...go figure! I also originally wanted to do 100 miles total this hike; that would have been about 12.5 miles a day for 8 days. But I decided that since we had to turn around and hike back half way (we couldn't find anyone to pick us up at our proposed exit point), this was our first time and it was only going to be 7 days, we could hike to Blood Mt and back, which with the Approach Trail, it would have only been 75.6 miles. No problem, I hike 21.5 in one day every weekend. Well, I failed to take into consideration that Firewolf didn't have time to train like I did. Just goes to show that plans are not concrete and you have to be flexible. Well, we got to Amicalola Falls and registered at the visitor's center (saftety reasons). We had to park on the side of the road because the hiker's parking lot was full (you not only have to pay to get into the park, but also for the parking). We didn't get started actually hiking until around noon.Both Heather and I had about 38 lbs in our packs, including water and food. I started out strong and fresh up the Approach Trail. Poor Firewolf, even before we got to the stairs to the top of the falls, she was falling behind. She not only didn't train, but she also has exercise induced asthma and she likes to stop and look around a lot. We slowly made our way up the stairs stopping numerous times for Firewolf to catch her breath. Boy, was it ever busy! Of course it was a Saturday on a beautiful autumn day, but I did have a passing thought of just how much weight those metal stairs could hold! We finally made it to the top and stopped for a breather and a snack. The weather was so gorgeous and the leaves were beginning to turn nicely.Most of the hike on the first day was uphill, so we only made it to the top of the ridge before Nimble Gap. It was getting dark so we stealth camped right before you start descending into Nimble Gap. There are a couple of really nice campsites there (we cooked in one and slept in the other one across the trail). We got our tent and hammock (I have a tent, Firewolf has a hammock) set up, the bear rope hung, the firewood collected and the fire started all before dark. I thought we did pretty good getting all that done in the short time we had before dark, but we did have to eat in the dark.Firewolf is great at starting and maintaining fires, so that was her job and my job was to collect the firewood and handle the bear bag hanging. Most of the wood is small branches as the 'fireplace' size wood is either extremely rare or non-existent. Even if I would have had an axe or hatchet, it just wasn't available (I'm not cutting down trees. It's illegal and besides, green wood just doesn't burn unless your fire is really, really hot.)We had a dry camp and were low on water. We would have been fine water-wise if we could have made it to Black Creek Shelter a mile or so farther, but we left too late and hiked to slow. We did have enough water to have dehydrated dinners, but not enough for coffee or hot cocoa that night or in the morning. We had enough firewood to sit around the fire, stay warm and chat (yes, I was still running my mouth! LOL). When we finally retired, we were getting chilled as there was a decent wind and we had to let the fire burn out.",,Day 1 - First Pre-Hike,"Oct 25, Sat",5.50
Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477883,"Before I start this day, please accept my apologies for the paragraphs combining themselves. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I'm going to try text format instead of HTML on this entry and see if it works.We both stayed warm through our first night on trail, although I didn't sleep well and Firewolf said she didn't either. Between not being able to stretch and move in my mummy sleeping bag, the strange noises and just the new experience, I must have awoke 15 or more times. I did sleep long enough to have a very vivid drea about a bear which gave me my official trail name. So I am no longer Crazy Cat Lady (sorry kids), but am Ghost Bear. I'll tell the dream/story of my naming later in this journal.I woke up around 7:20 (my new stopwatch/alarm didn't go off at 7 so I must have not set it right). Even though we got up early, we didn't get on the trail until about 11:00, which is fine, I realized we weren't going to make it to Blood Mt, so we might as well relax, take our time and thoroughly enjoy the nature around us.We had enough water to get to the next creek and performed our first water collection/purification ritual. I have a prefilter and a Steripen UV purifier. It worked great and the mountain water tastes so good! Firewolf collected the water and pre-filtered it and then I purified it and poured it into each container. Firewolf also had a bottle that had it's own purification system in it.We enjoyed the hike and made it to the top of Springer Mt. and got pics taken with the plaque. I didn't see the boots that everyone takes pictures of and don't know were the box was that has the log book in it to you sign. That's okay, hopefully I will learn where it is and get to sign it the next time I hike up to the top of Springer.We made it to Stover Creek Shelter by about 5:30. Nothing dramatic happened, we had plenty of water and enjoyed our surroundings and each others company. At the shelter, Firewolf made a fire with a lot of small limbs, twigs and leaves. The area around the shelter is pretty picked over for firewood so we only had enough wood for the evening fire, but no morning fire (no coffee again in the morning). I helped Firewolf eat mor of her food to make her pack lighter. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't complaining about the weight, but insisted on lightening the load. Of course I love to eat, so I didn't turn down the hot meal! We settled down for the night around 9:00. Nobody else showed up at the shelter, shich was fine with me, but Firewolf really enjoys being around other people.",,Day 2 - First Pre-Hike,"Oct 26, Sun",0
Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477884,"(I figured out how to make paragraphs)Monday morning we still didn't get on the trail until 11:00. I even got up at 7:00 (I didn't wake Firewolf until 7:30) and started packing stuff up and getting ready. I guess I'm slow in the morning and like to sit around and drink coffee (which I didn't have this morning). My excuse is that my back meds have to kick in before I can hike LOL. I'm not sre what Firewolf's excuse is though! We topped off our water on the way out of the shelter area (the creek noted at the shelter was dried up). Stover Creek crosses the trail before and after the shelter.We made it to Hawk Mountain Shelter by 4:30 or so, so I think we were getting alittle quicker, but not by much :-). We found plenty of wood at this shelter as I was able to search farther than most of the previous hikers wanted to. There was one guy there that kept to himself. He looked like he had been there for a day or more. Later on the trail I heard that he was a ""resident"" at that shelter. We tried to get him to talk, but he wasn't interested in company. We stayed up a little later than the night before and we had collected enough wood to have some for in the morning.",,Day 3 - First Pre-Hike,"Oct 27, Mon",0
Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477885,"I slept better Monday night, but still woke up several times. My air pad is constructed in such a way that it warms and holds body heat, so I laid on it and opened my mummy sleeping bag, using it like a blanket. I was able to stretch out more and therefore was a lot more comfortable. I do know I need to get an air pillow! The pillow I made from my extra clothes was lumpy and hard.Our resident wouldn't even say a word to Firewolf Tuesday morning when she went past the shelter on the way to the privy. Maybe he didn't hear her? I made sure he heard me speak as I went by before we left that morning (we left around 10:45) and he did answer me. I guess I just have a big mouth! LOL I did learn that you don't pee in privies, you do that in the woods. Privies are strickly for pooing.We headed back to Springer Mt as we didn't want to hike for 3 hours and then turn around and retrace our steps, not with our packs (Firewolf calls them rucksacks) anyway. We didn't feel comfortable leaving our stuff and slackpacking as we had originally planned, so we just started back the way we came.We made it back to Stover Creek Shelter and had company Tuesday night. We mad a joint effort to find firewood and between 3 of us, were able to find quite a bit. We sat around the campfire eating and picking the brain of Wild Turkey, a section hiker that has been doing 300 mile sections the last few years. It was great talking to him and learning some tricks and tips. A couple showed up early before we got the fire going (the man helped with the firewood collection) and a father and son (Thor) thru-hiking duo came in later that evening. Wild Turkey gave Firewolf a hot cocoa mix (to add to the pile she already had) and he gave me a couple of Starbuck's instant coffee packs (yummy!) I saved my coffee packs for the next time I got coffee.Everyone was already in their bags by the time Firewolf and I went to bed.",,Day 4 - First Pre-Hike,"Oct 28, Tue",0
Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477920,"Wednesday morning as we were getting up, it started to rain, which got us (or at least me) breaking down our stuff before it got wet. Everyone but the couple had left by that time and I got to talking to them and somehow forgot to pack up my tent stakes. About the time they left Laser showed up (another Section Hiker), and we got more hiking tips while we waited for the rain to stop. We were in any hurry as we were now a day ahead of schedule for our return.Laser left before we did and the rain stopped around 11:00 (go figure!), so we headed out. We collected water on the way out of the shelter area, making it to Black Creek Shelter on the Approach Trail by 2:45. It was foggy the whole day and started to drizzle the last mile or so before the shelter; shortly after arriving at the shelter it started to rain for real. We decided to spend the night there instead of at the campsite we stayed at on our first night out. The wind started to pick up so we pitched my tent inside the shelter. It was after 4:00 and nobody had showed up since we got there. I figured the tent would offer us additional protection from the wind and cold. Shortly after we completed the tent set-up and started eating a cold supper (we couldn't make a fire as everything was wet and the wind kept getting stronger), a hiker arrived. We never got his name, but he was our trail angel for the trip. He had a stove and made us hot water for coffee (me) and hot cocoa (Firewolf). I shared the Starbucks coffe I got from Wild Turkey with him.We went to bed really early (before dark) just so we could be warm. The man pitched his tent at a campsite, even though we moved everything to give him plenty of room (over half the shelter). He was an older man, so maybe he felt it inappropriate to sleep in the shelter with two women, who can say, but I worried about him staying warm the whole night as I was freezing!",,Day 5 - First Prehike,"Oct 29, Wed",0
Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478083,"Firewolf and I get along great and I think she and I will go on plenty of adventures in the future, but I'm not sure we will be doing thru hikes together. She doesn't want to average more than 6 - 7 miles a day, so she can relax and explore. I don't have a problem with either of those. In fact, I love doing that, but trying to thru hike the AT with that mileage is impossible (if I'm wrong, please correct me!) If you hike 6 days a week for 6 months, you would have to average 14 -15 miles per day. There is a time limit due to winter weather. Now hiking that low mileage for section hiking would be fine, but that's not what I want to do. I'm really quite disappointed because in almost every other way we are compatible hiking buddies.I guess everyone's reasons and expectations are different, but daily average mileage is a tremendous requirement on a thru hike, in my opinion. The other difference we have is human contact. She seemed disappointed that there weren't more people to interact with when camping, whereas I would have been fine with not seeing a soul the whole time we were on trail.She admitted that she's not sure that the whole carrying everthing on your back is her thing and I'm pretty sure she didn't enjoy herself nearly as much as I did. I will give her some time, then talk to her about the whole idea, how she feels about it and if she got out of the hike what she had anticipated. Some thoughts on equipment (please share your thoughts and opinions) - I really liked my pack (Lowe Alpine), even though it weighs about 6 lbs empty. I like the shorter, wider pack instead of the taller, narrower ones. I do with it had external pockets though. My tent (Ozark from Walmart) worked very well. I like the room I have in the two man tent. I was able to keep my and Firewolf's packs in it at night and still had plenty of room. It weighs around 3 lbs, which I think is pretty good for its brand and size. I do need to waterproof it and shomehow make a bigger raincover, but I really like the shower floor design.I loved the airpad and the 3/4 length worked well until it got cold. But I think that would be solved by getting a warmer sleeping bag. I may consider getting a full length pad.My sleeping bag (also Ozark from Walmart) worked great until it got down in the high 30s, low 40's with a wind. The rating of 32 deg was false. I wonder how warm it would be if I combined two sleeping bags. It would provide versatility when weather changes and I could always sleep on top of one if I didn't need to use both. Of course there is the weight and space issue that would need to be considered. I don't like the mummy design, as I don't have room to stretchout, but it worked well as a blanket when combined with the airpad - until it got cold of course.The Steripen UV purifier and pre-filter was an easy efficient system. No problems at all with it. I will need to find a larger wide-mouth drinking bottle though, as the wide-mouth is needed for the Steripen.I will definitely need to get a stove to use when you can't build a fire, and a lighter weight butane lighter. I need a good, bright head lamp and I think I would like one that clips onto your cap. The solar panel and battery takes forever to charge, maybe I need to try on of the cook pot or hand crank chargers. I definitely need some type of water proofing on my boots and better insoles (a lot better!). I will buy more Darn Tough socks and sock liners and the convertible pants were awesome! I need to rethink the rain gear and warm jacket and I need a knit hat as well as my sun visor. The two-piece thermal underwear worked well for sleeping and I could also use it under my clothes. But the shoes I used for camp shoes sucked. I need lighter weight and slip-on. I definitely need to try a SheWee! and bring more toilet paper!A little more variety in food would be nice. Maybe cut out the banana chips and peanut butter and add dehydrated foods as well as granola-type bars. The MioFit worked great for the water. I atel all the candy, but didn't touch the gum.The only other thing I didn't use was my repair kit (which is good), but I still need it, as well as an emergency blanket; maybe hand warmers for my feet? I have poor circulation and swore my feet had frost bite that last night (even though I know they didn't)There are many things to consider and either replace, tweek, add or delete. But that was one of the main reasons I did this hike.Which brings us to how I felt about the whole experience. I loved it! The last day was bittersweet. I didn't want to return to civilization, although I did look forward to the AYCE chinese buffet!   I can't wait to do another pre-hike and everyday my retirement and thru-hike get closer!I would like anyone who can give me pointers to sign and comment in my guest book. I will respond.",,Conclusion/Afterthoughts on First Pre-Hike,"Nov 13, Thu",0
Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478948,"Merry Christmas everyone! I hope your Christmas is full of family, friends and backpacking! I have a question for all you hikers out there. Where can I find a Mole Skin that will stay on when you sweat? The brands I have tried all come off as soon as I start sweating. I use it on my lower spine area to cover an area from surgery and bars that protrudes and the backpack and pants rub on it. Right now, I have been having to use a hand towel half tucked into my pants and draped over to protect the area because I can't find anything that will stick! Help!

Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483596,"Hello everyone! Thank you to those who have signed my guestbook. Sweet and Sour, I will respond. I haven't been on as I got myself a second job as part as my prep for my hike. How is a 2nd job prep you ask? Because I'm trying to pay off credit card and mortgage before it's time to thru-hike. When I retire, I won't have the means to pay that and hike. Unfortunately, this cuts into my training time. I was hiking 22 miles with 37 lbs every Saturday and am now doing 17 - 18 every other weekend, still with 37 lbs. I also walk 5 miles a day Tues thru Friday. Hopefully, I will stay in shape. I really don't have to get where I'm hiking 20+ miles because my plans are to hike the AT in six months; 6 days a week, at least 15 miles a day. This will give me plenty of time to complete the trail. I do need to decide when I want to start. I would like to avoid the cold as much as possible, only because winter gear adds weight. Im thinking mid to late March. Can anyone give me ideas one the weather before that time? I think it snows quite a bit. Any later than that and I probably wouldn't make it to Kathadin in time, not at the speed I want to go.I will find a journal to follow this year and see how the weather, water, etc is, although I know it changes from year to year. It still give info to add to the previous years' info. Anyone know of a good and informative journal?Thanks again for all you who have been checking out my journal!!",,Kink in Training,"Mar 13, Fri",0
Ghost Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515295,"Haven't entered in a while, as I'm working 7 days a week. I am down to one hike ever 6 weeks or so. It's a necessary setback so I can accomplish the things I wrote of in a previous entry. It sucks but in the long run it will allow me to fulfil my retirement dream - Triple crown and spend my retirement hiking! I do have news of my upcoming 6 day hike on the AT this October. We (FireWolf and I) are going to start as close as possible to where we left off last year. I believe we will be starting at HighTower Gap. We will once again have to hike 3 days north and then turn around and hike back to FireWolf's truck. A hiker on one of my FB groups said if we do this for the whole trail, we will finish a Nobo and Sobo hike in the same week! I wonder if anyone has ever done this? LOLAnyway, I will let you all know how we do. I have a couple of item changes since last year. I changed cell phone carriers, bought a new backpack (lighter), a new tent (same weight), and a new sleeping bag (different style), as well as a different charger pak as my solar charger didn't work too well under the canopy of trees. I'm still going with the no cooking food except for instant coffee (gotta have that joe first thing in the morning!), which I can drink cold if need be. FireWolf does have a pot that we can heat water up in. We will only be sleeping at a shelter area twice this year as we are slow hikers and won't be able to hike from shelter to shelter and the shelters are farther apart for this hike.I will make an entry shortly after I get back. I know the weather has been bad lately up there and I'm hoping we will not have to reschedule.",,Another Short Hike on the AT,"Oct 06, Tue",0
