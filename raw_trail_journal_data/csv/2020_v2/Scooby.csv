Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611820,After reading a bunch of journals from people who have started this year I have decided to move my start date up by 2 weeks to possibly avoid the spring bubble. Hopefully I can stay ahead of the big crowds and have places to tent or shelter. Sounds like they can get pretty full during the spring rush.,,View Entry,"Apr 28, Sun",0
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625432,It's been a while since I have been on here but I'm back. Finally got out on the trail today and I felt all of it. Typical AT of climbing up the side of the mountain then back down. I did t do too bad having not been out there in a while.Made it to the shelter and turned around and headed back. I was hoping to see a southbounder or even a section hiker but didn't see a soul.Once spring gets here that will change. So with this hike I am now at 99.5 of the AT hiked. Still planning on my thru hike comming up soon so at least I have seen some of the trail. So not a bad day of 7.4 miles..keep on hiking,,Spring Mtn shelter,"Dec 26, Thu",3.80
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625577,When I think of the most taken pics on the AT the biggest one is Mount Katadin's sign. Many people break down when they see this because they have fulfilled a dream. Next pic I believe would be Macafee Knob. Then I feel that the Amicalola Falls Arch has to be up in the top 5. So here I am. My goal is to just check things out and see where it all begins. Today's huge hike was climbing up the 600 plus stairs to the top of the falls. It's only 1.25 miles to reach the top but now that is out of the way. Still have 7.25 miles to reach the start of the AT. Not sure on when I return here in March if I will finish the approach trail or just start at the AT. Weather will play a big part because you have to drive up a dirt service road to get to the parking area which is at the top of Springer. Guess I will find out in 10 weeks. Can't believe it's that close. Hope everyone out there has a happy new year,,Amicalola Falls,"Dec 31, Tue",2.20
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625578,Since I was so close to Neels Gap I just had to come check the place out. The tree with all the hiking boots hanging from them was so awesome. The hike today was up the side of blood mountain. It was 2.3 miles of continuous climbing. As you got towards the top the views became breath taken. You can even see the sky scrapers from Atlanta. The trail was really busy today due to it is New Years Day. What a way to spend it too. Got to blood mountain shelter and turned around and went back down. Went to check out the outfitters and it is really equipped with anything a hiker will need. Very nice place. I talked with the guy behind the counter about the trail that I just hiked and he told me that I went up the harder side of the mountain. I didn't think that it was that bad at all. So northbounders the south side of Blood mountain is the easier side. Also the whole area is bear canister only so keep that in mind when hiking up and over the mountain. I ant wait until I get to hike through here as a thru hiker..until the next hike.....,,Needs Gap,"Jan 01, Wed",2.30
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626340,This is everything that I am planning on taking for my hike. I am thinking is all of this going to fit. So I grabbed my 48 liter backpack and started to pack. After leaving out one pair of clothes and having 4 days of food I got everything to go in with a little bit of room left. I definitely don't want a bigger pack because I would just load it down with items I don't really need. So I know as soon as the weather warms up some of my winter gear will be heading home.. The weight still feels good though. Will find Out how much it isnext weekend. Three weeks to go and I will be making my way towards north Georgia. Happy hiking. Scooby,,View Entry,"Feb 21, Fri",0
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626542,My weight without food or water came to 22 pounds exactly. That is having all my winter and summer gear packed. So I will get to shed some of the weight as it warms up. I will keep my puffy and one set of base layers for those surprising cold nights. I loaded up my pack with four days of food a two liters of water and now I am up to 32 pounds. Definitely will eat my heavy food first. Less than two weeks the adventure starts. Hope to see y'all on the trail.,,View Entry,"Mar 02, Mon",0
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628193,"Since it has been a while and as you can tell I didn't get to start my thru hike this year. So I am doing the next best thing and still getting out and hitting the AT.
Today I was able to hike from Dennis Cove Rd to route 321 at Watauga Lake in Hampton,Tenn. 
The trail for the first mile is flat and then you drop 300 steps down to Laural Falls. With the recent rains the falls were flowing fast. The trail head had a sign at the start said that the trail was flooded out but it wasn't at this time so you don't have to take the upper side trail. After hiking next to the stream for a few tenths the trail starts a nice long climb of 1800 feet. Didn't have a lot of great views today with all the leaves on the trees. As I was hiking down the other side of the mountain you did get to see Watagua Lake from about 3 miles out. The trail goes right to the beach which is pretty cool. That's it for today. Hope to see some of y'all on the trail.As of today I have hiked a total of 120 miles of the AT. Can't wait to do more","Dennis Cove Rd

Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629894,What a great day to get out and hit the trail. Been a while since I have added anything to my journal. The hike wasn't too bad. A lot more downs than up. Only saw one water source today. Since we haven't had a good days of rain the small creeks are drying up. That's not helping me with my over nighters I want to do. Just know that I am ready for 2021 to get here so I can hit the trail and get my they hike underway. I now have around 140 miles of the trail complete. I plan on rehiking these sections. For now great training. Happy hiking,"Clingsmandoom

Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631282,Went out and did an easy hike this time. A huge 5.6 miles round trip not including the half mile of hiking up to the trail at Clingsman Dome. The hike consisted of a 1200 foot decent to the shelter. On the way down I ran into a dad and daughter hiking north. The daughter was around 6 years old and having an awesome time. Dad said that they did an over nighter at Siler Bald shelter. So she hiking in 4.8 miles to the shelter. Very impressive. Great to see people like that out on the trail. Ran into several 2 group hikers doing half of the smokies. Hope they don't get too wet in the next few days. Hiked back up the hill and done for another day. Waiting on March to get here. Happy hiking and see ya on the trail.,"Clingsman Dome

Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631436,"As you can see it was a short day today. My goal was to hike to mountaineer shelter to finish up a section. So round trip it will be a 3.4 mile day. 
As soon as I got on the trail I ran into three guys doing a section hike of around 40 miles. I came across them wearing shorts and t-shirts. I was chilled just looking at them since it was only 41 out. Said my good lucks to them and started down the hill. About a half mile in ran into four women in their 60's out doing a section hike as well. Didn't catch how far they were going. Then half a mile later there was six more people with full packs. It is so cool to see so many people out on the trail. 
Made it to the shelter and headed back. Uneventful day and not much to see either. The trail is getting a few leaves on it which hides the roots and rocks so you need to watch your step. In a few more weeks it will be more on the trail. Planning another hike tomorrow so hope to go farther. Total AT hiked is now up to 144.8. Weeks are counting down to next year.",,Mountaineer shelter,"Oct 17, Sat",1.70
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631458,Today's theme was to double to miles from yesterday and I succeed in that. It was nice just to be able to get on the trail two days in a row. Started this day on the far side of Hotsprings and walked through town. Definite a busy town cause it took me a while just to find a place to park. Walked through town and as soon as you get into the woods you immediately start to climb. The climb lasted about a mile and a half before leveling off. Ran into a couple who were out for a three day hike and they told us that they had brought a bottle of wine with them. That's a lot of extra weight. I like my water.The last 6/10 to the shelter was downhill. Small shelter that sleeps about five and has a pipe spring just before you get to the shelter. After taking about a 10 minute break we started back towards Hot Springs.over in all a fairly easy day. Saw a few section hikers but not as many as yesterday. Temps climbed up into the 60's so a perfect day to hike. Total trail miles to date 148.2,,Deer Park Mountain shelter,"Oct 18, Sun",3.40
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631580,"Planned for a short day but ended up hiking a little more than planned. Parked at Tanyard Gap just north of Hot Springs and hit the trail. The trail climbs up around two and a half miles to get to the side trail to the tower. At first I didn't even know there was a fire tower ahead until a family that I was passing asked if I was hiking to it. I passed it up and figured I would stop on the way back.
Hiking down the other side of the hill I ran into a couple of guys heading south with full packs. They were thru hikers that are doing a flip flop. They don't have a lot of miles left. Good for them. It's always cool to talk to those out here to see who is section hiking or thru hiking.
As I am hiking on in my on little world I cross a dirt road. I am thinking that I'm getting close to my turn around point. I check gut hooks and it tells me I still got .2 tenths to go. I come across the same dirt road just a little bit down the trail and think this isn't it so I keep going. After about ten minutes I check gut hooks and it now says that I am .4 tenths past the road. So I turn around. That's an extra .8 tenths of a mile unplanned. Glad it's a training hike but that's the way things go out here. It's a steep climb heading south from there. Glad it doesn't last long. Got back to the trail head for the tower and climbed up that trail for .15 tenths. Good views but another .3 added to the miles. There was a good spring just north of the turn off for the tower trail and also there are two more in between Tanyard Gap trail head and the tower if anyone needs that info. Until the next hike.....",,Hurricane Gap,"Oct 24, Sat",3.40
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631583,Today was a day for the views. Started off by leaving Hotsprings and walking across the French Broad River. The trail gets to follow the river for about an half of a mile then it turns up. Great climbing for just over a mile. The views got better and better the higher you went up. Lovers Leap had one the best views looking back at Hotsprings. When you got to the top of the hill you are walking on a ridge that has views of mountains on both sides. What also helps is that the trees have most of their leaves gone now so you get more of a view. Excellent day of hiking and can't wait to get out here again. Up to 157.3 total AT miles hiked so far. A long way to go still.,,Tanyard Gap,"Oct 25, Sun",5.70
