RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626933,"Never expected to be in Georgia today.  My train reservation was all set for departure on March 26 but in light of all the craziness going on right now, I decided on Thursday to leave as soon as possible.  Just got off the 26 hour train ride, found my shuttle ride and finished breakfast.  Can't wait to set off.",,View Entry,"Mar 14, Sat",0
RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626952,"Made it to the top of Springer (3782 feet) by 3 pm.  No sense taking photos here - freezing rain, fog, wind with a little hail.  The good news is that the rain stopped once I was a mile downhill.  Ran into a trail runner who told me there were two hikers in self quarantine at Black Gap Shelter.  The runner thought they maybe just wanted the shelter to themselves.  Who knows?????  Headed to Stover Creek Shelter tonight.  Slept very little on the train last night.","Amicalola Falls

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626989,"The good news is that the rain stopped about an hour ago.  The bad news is over with - It rained yesterday, all of last night and all morning.  Everything I own is either wet or damp.  The trail is a quagmire.  I was hoping for a better start, but that's the way it goes. Got a fairly good 12 hour night's sleep, just getting a little wet.  Now I'm at the top of Sassafras Mountain, elevation 3347'.  Hope to get to Justus Creek tonight. ","Stover Creek Shelter

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627019,"It hasn't stopped raining since I starting walking this morning.  It's a steady cold drizzle in the clouds.  Slid in the mud and just kept on sliding until I came to a gentle landing. Didn't get hurt, but am totally covered in mud.  Staying at a hostel tonight where it's warm and dry. They're going to do my laundry here at the hostel plus provide dinner, breakfast and showers and coffee all the time.  Hope my clothes don't ruin their machine!  Feel great - the knees are holding up just fine.","Justus Creek

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627047,Fourth day of strait rain.  Finally quit pouring about 2:30 this afternoon.  I'm a muddy mess again. Headed back to where I spent the night last night so that I could climb Blood Mountain (4457') with a small pack.  Left everything but food back at the hostel. Haven't taken any scenery pictures yet because of the fog. Feel good!,"Suches, Georgia
