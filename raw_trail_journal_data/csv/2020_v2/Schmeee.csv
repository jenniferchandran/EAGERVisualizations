Last night the owner had his brother from Atlanta come up and bring pulled Pork, beans, slaw and peach cobbler from his Atlanta restaurant Tipsy Pig BBQ. It was fantastic. Woke up to pouring rain but had to head out. Shuttle to Neel gap at 9:30!and then a wet morning of hiking. Clears nicely by 1pm and a 7 hour 11.5 mile hike left me at Low Gap Shelter. Sleep here tonight and then at it again. Weather tomorrow is forecast heavy rain again so probably will have a short day. Excuse the typos but too tired to go fix them all!!Hope all is well with everyone.

Schmeee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626655,"Schmee againI didn’t do a journal entry yesterday because I didn’t have service last night. My plan was to leave BlueMountain shelter early and get to deep gap shelter which is about a 15 mile hike. My plan was to stop at Tray mountain shelter for lunch. The weather was absolutely Horrible. Cold rain, fog and wind made this a very difficult hike. When I got to tray Mtn  shelter for lunch I decided after lunch that I would just stay at Trey Mountain shelter. There was one spot left in the shelter and I grabbed it. I set up my sleeping bag got in to warm-up and fell asleep. This is an about 1 o’clock in the afternoon. When I woke up around three the weather had started to break. Eventually I decided to set up my tent and leave the shelter. Shelter living is just a little too close for me. I grabbed a nice spot with a beautiful view which is the picture I think you see with this journal entry. Everything was fine until about 11 PM. My sleeping pad deflated which leaves me on the ground with no insulation. It’s very cold. The wind also picked up to around 40 miles an hour. All in all I had a pretty good night sleep even though the temperatures were well below freezing. On Friday I hiked  from Tray Mountain all the way to Dicks Creek, 11 1/2 miles. At Dick‘s Creek I was met by good friend Curtis Walker who pick me up and took me to his cabin in Clayton. Wayne Tidwell from nearby big canoe also came up to join us. After A nice bourbon we headed into town for me to buy a new sleeping pad a new water filter and re-supply my pantry. Had a nice dinner in town and now back at the cabin getting ready for tomorrow’s hike. I should be in North Carolina sometime Sunday with my next big stop being Franklin North Carolina sometime mid next week.I love all the comments, even the wise cracks (you know who you are) so keep them coming.","Blue mtn sheltet

Schmeee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626690,"schmee again!Before I tell you about today I have a couple of thank you. First thanks to Bill at Outside 76 in Clayton GA. They are an excellent outfitter and Bill is a real Deal as far as through hikers.  Discounts, showers, shuttles, gear and hotel deals are all possible. Skip Hiawassee and head to Clayton!!!Also a big shout out to my buddies Curtis and Wayne. Curtis made me breakfast this morning and we drive back to Dicks Gap around 10. They even hiked the first 100 yards with me. They will tell you it was the first mile but decide for yourself. I did have a great night last night at Curtis’s place even though I was beat.  now on today. I had only planned to go 4 miles to the first shelter but today was beautiful. I adjusted to take advantage of the great weather and ended up at ably Gap NC. Yes as the picture shows I walked right across that Ga/NC line! Big accomplishment as I now have 1 state out of the way. Very proud to have crossed this milestone. If the weather stays good and I get a good night sleep I might have another good day tomorrow. schmee out.","Dicks Creek Gap

Schmeee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626726,Schmee againPhoto wouldn’t upload so you’ll have to use your imagination. A very cold night last night and my new sleeping pad didn’t do much to keep the cold ground off my body. Woke up numerous times trying to find ways to stay warm. Got up with the dune and started today’s trek. Other than being WAY up high with some fantastic views today was just a nprety good hike. One very steep ascent that really wore me out. tomorrow I hope to pull a 16 miler to get me close to Franklin NC. I want to take a zero day in Franklin on Wednesday so need to be there Tuesday evening. Rain coming again so I  want to try to stay warm and dry as much as possible. schmee out!,"Bly Gap NC

Schmeee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626773,"today was my longest hike yet. 16+ miles and about 8.5 hours. I set out just after 7am after a nice breakfast of grits and hot coco. Had some beautiful scenery from very high up. You know you are up high when all the mountains you are looking at are below!!! The weather was pretty good so I hiked in a variety of short sleeve,long sleeves and just hukibg pants. Interesting how the weather changes at almost every turn in the mountains. You can go from a sunny warm climate to a bone chilling, cloudy and windy climate in about 100 yards. The mountains are always changing!!Got to my shelter and the herd is thinning. Only about 8 people at the site tonight. I actually tried to set up my tent but couldn’t find a level spot so I opted for the shelter. It was a 12 man shelter and by 5:00pm there were only 4 people in it so I grad a spot on the upper level (yes this was a double decker shelter)and setup my bed. Still having trouble with Mitch sleep pad but as the overnight temperature was only going down to low 40s I tihought this would be a pretty good night. Made my spaghetti mre dinner and went to be around 7. Could not get connections to internet. Inly woke up about 3 times thru  the night for reinflating my  sleeping pad and deflating my bladder. Always a cold event to deflate the bladder!Overall a pretty good day. Schmee out","Standing Indian shelter

woke up today to rain. I knew I was heading in to Franklin and in Franklin I would have a nice cozy hostel to stay at the next 2 nights. I also was pleasantly surprised about 3 miles into the hike this morning  when some trail angels (students from Sam Houston University in Texas on spring break) graciously offered me “trail magic”. No this is not some 1970’s drug (but that might have been ok) but some pretty fresh egg McMuffins! It is amazing  to see the support of perfect strangers in the middle of nowhere offering food, a warm van and a nice conversation!  Rock on Sam Houston!!!! A pretty quick 4 hour 7.2 mile hike in the rain was fine until I slipped in the mud the last 100 yards. Painful and a pretty good size contusion on my left thigh but mostly just pissed off as I had stayed pretty clean for the rest of the trip. Anyway my shuttle driver was at the crossing waiting for me and took me right to the “ Cheeka and Sunset” hostel in Franklin. Got a shower, some lunch and now I’m going to work on my sleeping pad. Should have nice zero day tomorrow. keep those comments coming!!! They really help, even the sarcastic one!
So for a little feedback from me, yes Lesley the puzzle has been a big hit as we all sit around each evening and reconstruct the trail. And for all you over/under gamblers, I hope you unders are feeling the pressure. Schmeeee is still going strong!!!!

So today is a zero day. No hiking. A day to organize, relax, regroup and work on my sleeping pad. Guess what, I found the freeking leak. A very tiny pinhole. I put an adhesive patch on it but the guy at the outfitter said I should do a bonded repair so he gave me some special sauce to use with a patch. I’ll know in about 3 more hours if it works. The adhesive patch did work but I wanted to be as safe with this repair as possible. 
The picture is a couple of buddies I’ve hiked with and will possibly continue with. Joehikes is the older guy and Seeker the younger. In case you are not sure who I am, I’m the very old guy on the right!!!Another good thing that happened today was at breakfast. The hostel had a little game where the person that guessed a number between 1-100 closest to the number on an envelope would get the contents of the envelope. I guessed 22, my birthday and that was exactly the number. Winner winner! In the envelope was a free night stay here donated by a friendly New Zealander that had met the hostel owners so my first night here was FREE. Schmeeee likes freee!
Planning to get to the NOC Friday evening for another resupply and then on to Fontana Dam, the last stop before entering the Smokie Mountains!
All is well and I hope all is well with you all in Corona-Ville.
Miss everyone, please keep the cards and letters coming!!!

the day started great. A nice breakfast is French toast casserole, sausage, fruit and sweet buns. Chica and Sunsets hostel is one of the finest and they are both fantastic people. After breakfast Sunsets took us back to Winding Stair Gap. At drop off the weather was perfect for hiking but as I climbed the mountain to Wayah Bald the rain started. I used my fancy hiking umbrella I had purchased a few days earlier and it made the hike very nice. The umbrella handle was held in place by me chest strap and the umbrella covered my hard as well as my pack. I was able to avoid my rain gear completely and hiked in shorts and a tee shirt. 
Other than covering another 16 miles in about 8.5 hours the day was uneventful. Couldn’t take any pictures because I was mostly in fog all day.
Campsite is crowded tonight as about 16 peeps here. Best news......... I’m writing this latlying on my sleeping pad and it appears to be fixed.  Amazing that such a simple thing can make such a big difference in how I feel. Let’s hope it holds all night. 
Tomorrow I’ll be heading to the NOC ( Nantahalla Outdoor Center) and purchase my Smokie Nountain pass. 
I hope this message finds everyone happy and healthy as I hear things are getting really serious out there.

Day 15 in the books! Friday the 13th and so far no bad luck. Hiked 11.7 miles of extremely difficult mostly downhill in about 6.5 hours. 
Last night was great inside the tent. My sleeping pad held air all night and my tent didn’t leak. Outside the wind gusted up to 40mph and the rain was heavy. 
I started my  hike today in a steady rain but by 11am I shed the rain gear and went back to shorts and tee shirt and my umbrella! This umbrella is great. The rain finally stopped about 12:30 and the rest of the day has been nice. The picture is a panoramic shot from  the top of the ridge the trail follows. A lot of the trail at any of the peaks is literally about 2 feet wide. The left drops off steeply to the left and the right drops of the same and you are just straddling the ridge. Tonight I am at a bunk room (18 beds)at the NOC and just finished a nice juicy Burger for dinner. I restocked food for 3 days which is when I hope to be in Fontana Dam. Thanks to everyone for reading and commenting. I love hearing from you and will try to reply to everyone. You have to put your email in for me to reply.

Well today was a good day. Started off around 8am and had a 6.2 mile long 3400 foot ascent right out of the gate. It wasn’t too bad but but one thing I’ve learned and that is the downhill is far harder than the uphill. The body takes a pounding when you have multiple 2.5 foot drops that you have to hit just right or you jolt everything on your body. Needless to say I miss a lot of them!!!
The daily totals were 11.6 miles taking 7 hours. 
The picture is another pano from 5062 elevation at Cheah Bald. Not sure if the picture does the view justice but it was pretty cool!
Weather today was great for hiking. Cool and overcast. Tonight more rain expected but tomorrow late morning I hear it may clear up. 
Since the rest of the world is shut down and everyone has time on their hands I sure do think you can all step up your writing game! I mean really with all the sarcastic friends I have i am sure there is more material you can come up with. Some of you are doing ok so I won’t mention names but others ?. 
I know I usually limit conversations to 2 minutes but I will make exceptions because I know you all have to be more bored than me. At least I can get out of the house (tent)and take a walk. 
Ok enough humor from me. Hiker midnight now so I’m going to bed

Rainy night last night but not too windy. Started today’s hike planning to go 12 miles. When I got to the first crossroad I decided I wanted to eat some hot food so I hitched a ride into Robbinsville. It was a 7 miles ride. Took a while for a person to stop but on car #30 a nice little old ladie picked me up. She invited me to go to church with her but I told her I was afraid if the Corona virus and would pass. She dropped me off at McDonalds and I quickly devoured 2 egg McMuffin and hash browns. I actually ate them faster than they prepared them! 
The ride back to the trail was much better. 1st car picked me up. From there it was straight up Jacobs ladder. Probably the steepest longest section I’ve done. It kicked my butt. 
Put some videos on the site today so check them out. 
The day needed well with a nice Ramen Bomb. A ramen Bomb is a combination of ramen noodles and mashed potatoes. 810 calories. Tomorrow I head to Fontana Dam. A short 7 miler!!","Cody gap

So I started right at dawn this morning. No rain last night but just as I was packing up a light drizzle started. Just enough to get my tent a little damp before I packed !! Also the really bad news is looks like my leak in the pad is Back??. when I woke up it felt a little low and since then I have confirmed the patch came off. Anyway I do have some very good Tenacious tape and have put some on so hopefully it will hold. Won’t know until tomorrow night. Pretty easy hike today with only 7 miles and not to much up and down. And to finish off a great day there was some trail magic at the shelter. A woman from GA had a small grill and was grill hotdogs, chips, beer and soft drinks. I won’t go into how many of each I had but let me just say could be the best hot dogs I’ve ever had. Now I know with all the corona virus fears one might say you should not be eating food from strangers but man this is far away from everything and the virus can’t even find this place (I hope). 
Well I had to go into Fontana Lake village to resupply. The village originated back in the 40’s when the Government decided to build the Fontana Dam to generate power to make Aluminum. The village housed the workers who were building the dam. Quite a dam and lake and now village. I’m staying in the village tonight and will hit the trail tomorrow. Smokie mountains start tomorrow!!!!

Having trouble uploading video so I’ll have to do it when I have some WiFi available. 
Anyway Day 20 i entered the Smokies. Raining like crazy as I crossed over the Fontana Dam. It was very cool walking over this dam as the lower side was some 400 feet below. I have a great vuseo that I will post of me dropping My Smokie mountain pass in the box at the trailhead. Stay tuned for that.
The rain did stop about 1 hour into the hike and the rest of the day was hiker nice. 
And guess what? I called Nemo, the sleeping pad mfg and they are sending me a new pad. I will pick it up in Gatlinburgh in Friday. Talk about a company that takes care of customers!!! Also a shout out to the NOC Gatlinburgh. That are officially closed but they are staffing for through hikers only. They realize that this dirty stinking community of crazy people walking around in the woods for who knows why really depend on these few businesses that support the community. They will allow 1 person at a time to come into the store and get what they need so I am happy I can pick up my pad. That’s Bill Morris at NOC and Ollie at Nemo!
So I’m hiking now with Joehikes. He is a great guy and he is cataloging his trip on YouTube. Check out his clips at joehikes.com. 
Today we did 15.1 miles in about 7.5 hours. I think I have my trail legs now and   Mileage may start to go up a little depending on terrain. kast night I stayed in the Fontana Lake Village. As I was getting ready this morning the power went out. The whole place was dark. No emergency lights in this place so the entire area was Black. A very eerie feeling with all the other stuff going on. wirst part was the big breakfast I was planning on having was off the table. Restaurant closed so I just bought a honey bun in the gift shop (oh yeah they had emergency power for the cash register ) and waited for the shuttle to the trail. min my tent now so ready for a good night sleep.

A short 5 mile day to Newfound Gap. This is the location to hit to get into Gatlinburgh. 
It is with a very mixed emotion that I am pulling off the trail today and returning home. The ATC is asking ALL hikers to suspend their hikes until the COVID19 has been better contained. Some of my hiking pals are continuing and others are going home so it is a mixed bag but for me I think I am making the right decision. I will return and I am very happy and proud that I have completed 215 miles!  Not easy but I have learned so much and am anxious to get back. Inviting all of you to come along for any/all of my next section so let me know who’s in!!!
I am writing this from home tonight so all is well and looking forward to sleeping in my own bed.
