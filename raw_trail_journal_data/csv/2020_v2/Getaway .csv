Getaway ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624964,"Ok. So three entries in trail journals and some pictures loaded to see if I could get this simple task of getting a journal started off the ground.I discovered the Appalachian trail in the early 90's when a younger brother abandoned his normal life and hiked the upper half of the trail, Harper's Ferry to Katahdin. Back then he used the official guide, no AWOL guide available then, and a compass. Pretty sure he would have used technology if it had been available but also pretty sure he preferred to do it the way he did, no cell phone and no guthook.",,View Entry,"Nov 18, Mon",0
Getaway ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624970,"Did my first hike dedicated to train for my 2020 AT thru hike. Walked a total of seven miles out and back next to the Colorado river in Grand Junction Colorado. The weather was typically beautiful, 60 degrees Fahrenheit, sunny,Â  no wind or precipitation. Tomorrow could be typically beautiful with snow, blowing snow and freezing temps. But today was easy hiking with a 20# backpack, my REI 40 liter, not the pack I intend to carry on my thru hike.",,View Entry,"Nov 19, Tue",0
Getaway ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626919,Decided not to redo miles. That officially makes me a section hiker this year just like last year and the year before. Got to a little beyond Damascus in 2016 and to Erwin in 2017 on a redo attempt. Last year and 2018 hiked north of Harper's ferry so I'm filling in the gaps now.,"Damascus
