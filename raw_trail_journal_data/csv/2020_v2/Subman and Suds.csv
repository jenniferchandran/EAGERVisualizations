We are fortunate to live near the Southern Terminus, Springer Mountain, and Enjoy hiking the Appalachian Trail. We hiked NoBo 2016 after Subman inticed Me with trail stories from his 2003 thru hike. We married on Springer Mountain in March of 2017. After having nueromas removed in both my feet and gaining back the weight I had lost in 2016, I am excited for another opportunity to Thru Hike again with my best friend.",,View Entry,"Dec 19, Thu",0
Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625349,I have told my employer that Feb. 13th will be my last day. Subman is retired so....I have taken a couple of 5 day weekends during Jan. We can start knocking out the Trail after Jan 1st. We will do 3-5 day stints until taxes and my work obligations are complete. We have been doing a few shakedown hikes and feel that our gear is updated and we are ready to start off slowly doing around 10 miles a day.,,View Entry,"Dec 20, Fri",0
Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625350,"As a nod of Respect to the early AT travelers we have decided to start from Mt. Oglethorpe. Mt Oglethorpe was the original southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. We plan to start at the top of Monument RD, the summit of Mt. Oglethorpe, and road walk as close as possible to the original trail. The roads have moved and the trail has grown over, crossing private property that owners don't wish you to trespass on. We have found a 1942 map and have driven and walked the area of the old AT. some of the old Timers are still around and you can pick up tidbits of information that helped put the pieces together. It has been fun discovering a part of AT history right out our back door.",,View Entry,"Dec 20, Fri",0

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625466,In 2016 I cried and pushed through a lot of pain to complete my thru hike. I thought it was Plantar Fasciitis but  it took doctors 2 years to diagnose mortons neuromas in both feet. Finally I had my surgery in April 2019. I am finally hiking again! But alas I regained the 55 pounds I lost in 2016. So lucky me I get to attempt another thru hike. Starting at the original Southern Terminus of Mt Olgethorpe! I am over the moon for a once in a lifetime opportunity to happen again. This next time it is a hike for health with my husband Subman. I never felt more confident or more strong then when I finished my thru. I have told my employer of my plans and Feb. 13th is my last day.  I am a Medical Laboratory Technologist and plan to travel tech after my hike. Its a leap of faith -Suds,,View Entry,"Dec 28, Sat",0
Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625499,"We are ready to go!!  I work the next 4 nights and Friday after work we will pick up our tags at the Park and start knocking it out. This past weekend we hit the trail hard. Friday after 2 hours sleep we climbed Blood Mountain and took the freedom trail to loop around to the parking area for around 6 miles. It was a climb, but more importantly for me, rocky. My feet did well so I gained a lot of confidence that my surgery has taken care of the major pain. Sub did great, but was tired when we were done. We recommitted ourselves to listening to our bodies and starting off slow in the beginning. It is hard to keep that perspective when we can remember how we hiked 4 years ago.  Sunday We hiked 6 miles on the Pinhoti trail, at Dennis Mill trailhead. It is a very good training hike with a lot of elevation to build strength and confidence. On the way back down the trail I stumbled off a rock at a water crossing, Stepping into the water actually brought back good memories of water crossings in the past, and the ability to shake it off. Thankfully it was not that cold and my foot was not really that wet. A big topic of conversation for Sub and I while hiking this weekend was what to do with our dog, Pepper. Pepper is our baby and it was very important that we found the best fit for her. Our dog is 12 years old, and the older she gets the more attached she is to us. We are fortunate that we have very supportive family and friends and Subman's Niece, Alicia has offered to take Pepper. So Pepper will be taking a trip to New York when we hit the trail full time in Feb. Pepper will enjoy the Hugs of Grayson and Georgia, Alicia's Children and we are happy knowing she will be loved. Dealing with Pets is a big deal and so important to feeling free to hike with no worries. That being Said this weekend, Doggie care has been an issue so we may end up day hiking the Mt. Olgethorpe and Approach trail sections as day hikes with full packs. Whatever it takes after the first of the year we are going North!",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Mon",0
Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625536,"This will be the last of our pre-hike entries. We plan to hike Friday the 3rd of Jan. after getting our Thru-Hiker Tags at the park.  We wanted to take this opportunity to wish everybody a healthy and blessed  New Year, We are excited to be able to Hike and appreciate the prayers and encouragement from all of you.  Hope you enjoy our journey!",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Wed",0
Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625581,"I worked midnight shift and got home at 8 am this morning. After looking at the radar and thinking we may get less wet if we started this morning then later this afternoon, We went to Amicalola and registered and got our tags. Subman is number 11 and I'm number 12. We then drove the 13.8 miles to the summit of Mt Olglethorpe. There is a old CCC type cabin with a survey marker stamped with the number 1 and Mt Olglethorpe. We are thinking this was the 1st survey marker for the trail laid in 1930. after a few pictures we started down Monument Rd. The road was foggy and we were sprinkled with light showers and tree rain. Starting our Thru-Hike Our Spirits were High, half the battle is making it to the trail and making a thru hike happen. We are so lucky to live nearby,  After a quick 5 miles we arrived at our car  that we had placed on Route 136. We picked up the car on the Summit and drove back to the park to leave the car overnight for tomorrows hike. Home now with our dog Pepper and resting up for our walk from Rt 136 to the park tomorrow, about 8.5 miles","Mt Olglethorpe

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625603,"Today we started at The intersection of Route 136 and Monument road. We have 8.8 miles to go today to get to the Park. The weather is good 47*, but a little windy creating  some spitting flurries. I have a wool hat that I like to wear, the kind that goes over your ears and down your cheeks with the dangling braids. I tied a knot in the braids and it easily slips off and on like a hood and I use this to regulate my body temperature while hiking. I also wear this wool hat at night when camping in the cold weather. It is made by Everest Designs, Subman has a beanie cap made by Everest designs also.  Today Subman had on his Frogg Togg jacket and used his hood when the wind kicked up, But still wore his red shorts. I hiked in my polar fleece all day and was comfortable. I need to toughen up my feet, the day of road walking earned me three blisters. I had put duct tape on my hot spots but I think I waited to long. After 5 miles we turned onto Faucetts Lake road which was beautiful, a lake surrounded by Beautiful homes.  Towards the end of the road, before turning onto Route 52, we stop and ate wraps for a quick lunch. The shoulder on RT 52 concerned me when we scoped out the hike but turned out to be sufficiently off the road. We turned at the roundabout and had 2 miles to go to Amicalola. It was cool entering the park hiking, and Subman was happy he finally got to Hike from Mt Oglethorpe to the park. We hiked up to the arch and will begin there tomorrow. We have completed the approach trail to the approach trail!After completing todays hike we took the outback up to Springer Parking lot on forest road 42. we plan to end there tomorrow. Our hike is already forming a plan of it's own. Since we had doggie care issues this weekend, there was no camping.  Flexibility is key during a thru hike and it has already proven to be true. Just dont let the little stuff end your hike. I will not be entering miles other then stating them in the title until we leave Springer Mtn. The Southern Terminus of the Trail. This way it will correspond with the AT guide miles.","Rt 136 and Monument Road

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625614,"We were at the Arch behind the Visitor Center  at 830 am. It took us almost 6 hours to reach Springer Mtn. It was a beautiful walk but Strenuous. It was 33 degrees when we took off and there was ice on the wood portions of the steps. We steadily climbed the stairs and enjoy the  Amicalola waterfall that runs right next to the steps. At the top of the Falls we had our first trail magic, 2  bottles of water! Someone knew hikers don't carry heavy water up steep climbs. That was very Thoughtful. We continued on up the trail and found it had scattered snow from the previous night. The Sun was out Bright for us but the wind was very cold. we adjusted our layers and put on chapstick to avoid windburn. Coming up Frosty Mountain is very hard, it is a steep long climb and we rewarded ourselves with a wrap sandwich at the top. following Frosty there is a steep long downhill to NimbleWill Gap erasing the climb we did coming up Frosty! Such is the Character of the Appalachian Trail. We meet a few Hikers from the Hike Inn and Day hiking The Approach Trail, I envied them their light packs. Along the way, climbing higher to Springer, There was Rim Ice everywhere. Rim Ice has always intrigued me it is almost magical how the icy threads rise out of the ground. We finally made it to Springer Summit and  there about 5 people there asking Us about Thru Hikes and what it all entails. I love Springer, It is where Subman and I exchanged our wedding Vows under the twisted Oak. There are a lot of happy memories here for me. We started Our 2016 Thu-hike here. Coming down Springer and officially on the Appalachian Trail we saw several people walking up from FS road 42. There were Icicles hanging off the rocks it was beautiful. I have put some pictures in the gallery of it. We ended our day at Forest Service Road 42 parking lot and came home tonight. I will be working the next four nights and we plan to get back out Hiking on Friday!","Arch

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625622,"Subman Had an Eye Appointment today so we spent the day on errands and housekeeping items. I filled out a request for replacement Oboz Sawtooth Low Shoes. I am wearing a size 9 right now and the toe box is smaller than what I need. I have worn Oboz sawtooth hiking shoes before. I like them, and they are good support shoe for Plantar Faciaitis, and very durable. Oboz is a great company. While on my 2016 Thru hike I was fitted in Hot Springs with Obozs, while trying to help some foot problems, and by Erwin I could tell they were to small. I contacted them and they sent me another pair of Obozs a size up free. I am Hoping I will get the same great response this time. I will keep you all posted. The other item I needed to tend to was a summons for jury duty I received in the mail Friday. They tell me I have to explain it to the Judge on Jan 27th, Hope he is a hiker!","Forest Service Road 42

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625634,"So Today I heard from Oboz. Apparently a thru hiker gets two replacements free during their thru Hike. I just needed to send them a picture of me starting the trail in my Obozs. In my case I also sent them a link to my Journal. Almost immediately they replied with an E-mail saying that they would send me a size 9.5 and use it as one of my free pair of shoes on my thru hike. Problem solved, and Thank you for the awesome customer service Oboz! Another incident I have been Managing, I apparently did something to my right knee and Monday it was swollen and painful on weightbearing. I iced it all day Monday and I have a Cho-Pat Knee brace that I wore at work last night. I work in an ER and the Doc confirmed ice, wrap it and take inflammatory Meds. I am using a Meloxicam Rx that I have, it is basically Aleve on steriods. Tonight the swelling is going down and it only hurts when kneeling on it. Im carrying a lot of extra body weight and Im sure that is not helping. I weighed in at 215lbs on starting day. I will continue to use the brace and take anti-inflammatory meds the next couple of days. Friday we plan to go from FS42 to Hightower Gap and access the knee for the next days mileage.  I was pretty alarmed to have the swollen knee on Monday since I really didn't remember hurting it. Of course the worse fears go through my mind, but for the grace of God a single injury can kill your hike and we just got started. I highly recommend Cho-Pat knee braces. I carry one and Subman carries one. they are easy to put on and support your knees on long downhills. we both used them on our 2016 hike. So for now looking forward to new Oboz Shoes and Hiking after work Friday Morning!","Home

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625672,"When we came home Sunday we unpacked our Backpacks and aired out our Down items to keep the loft that makes them retain their ability to keep us warm. Tonight we are packing our packs and getting ready to head out Tomorrow morning when I get off work. The plan is to go to Hightower Gap From FS 42. We have to come home after hiking because of our dog Pepper this weekend, but next week our 5 days out is covered so we have that to look forward to. At this point we are just winging it trying to get the miles in to get to the Smokies by the middle of Feb., for when we hit the trail full time. It seems as though this hike has been everything but what we had planned. Sometimes it is frustrating other times I look at things as it is fortunate it happened, Truthfully the 4 day break probably was just what my knee needed to recuperate. So tonight I hope all is calm in the ER so I can be a trooper tomorrow. I just want to get out there and Hike.","Home

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625683,"I got off work at 8am and followed Subman to Hightower Gap. We left our car and drove together to FS42 to begin our hike. It was 48* and heavily overcast, perfect hiking weather. As we made our way towards Stover Creek Shelter there was plenty of water and a couple of foot bridges to cross. The water was moving swiftly all along the trail and the color changed from winter brown to Rhododendron green, the Rhoddies were so plentiful lining the creek banks I bet the blossoms are amazing in the Spring. The Trail followed the river down into Three Forks. Which had one car parked in the area. This trailhead is very popular since it is only one mile to Long Creek Falls. Subman took me to Long Creek Falls on our first walk together it will always be a special place to me. The Falls is beautiful and worth the short blue blaze in to see it. We climbed up past the Falls to Hickory Flats where there is a Cemetery with a pavilion with picnic tables and an outbuilding that has pit toilets. this is a great place to stay especially if its bad weather. Just North of Hickory Flatts there is a stealth campsite. Subman and I stayed at that campsite last December. While camping there We heard Helicopters landing in a nearby meadow at around 10pm. It was very surreal, and a reminder that the Army Rangers play near the AT in this area. We continued on and come across a huge pair of boots hanging in a small tree near the trail. they were so large Sub and I each took one to carry out. I had just dressed 2 more blisters so I was not happy to increase my load. We went on to pass the Hawk Mountain Campground. I remember hiking here and seeing a Army Ranger carrying a 4x4 across his shoulders to help build tent sites for this campground. I heard that they also carried in the Bear Boxes to the Shelters. So a very big Thank You to them! We went past Hawk Mtn. Shelter and had just a half mile to go to Hightower Gap. While Hiking, our good friend Marsha (Grambo) called and she can take Pepper tomorrow! Pepper Adores Grambo and we feel very good about leaving her there. Grambo was our Support person in 2016 and was kind enough to watch pepper for the duration of our thru hike. A favor we will never forget! That means we get to camp tomorrow night. So we are very Excited about that.  We reached our car and went back to get the other car at FS42. I was beat. When we got home my new Oboz were delivered, so I will try them out tomorrow.","Forest Service Road 42

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625703,"today we took off from Hightower gap. We checked the radar and knew the major thunderstorms didnt start until 7pm. At 830am It was raining pretty good but temps were good at 57°. We put on our Frogg Togg Jackets which did an excellent job cutting the blustry wind gusts. At the end of the day we were going to be wet. We climbed out of Hightower gap and at the bottom of horse gap, we were looking at Sassafras Mtn. Subman said when you think you're on the top, you're not! I did my best saber (trekking pole) rattling shouting lets kick Sassafras' A**. I may have had the wind taken from my sails about halfway to the top. Slowly but surely one step at a time. We made it. Coming down to Cooper gap we run into a rotund hiker called Wildcard. He is wearing a trash bag for rain gear and had no pack. He stated he got a ride to what he thought was Springer Parking Lot. But in reality was Cooper Gap. Wildcard said his ride told him this was Springer. So he went 2 miles north of the gap? Ditched his pack ?  And turned south to when we ran into him. We advised him to get his pack and go to Gooch Shelter to seek shelter for the incoming weather. I hope he is well tonight. We went on to Justice Creek there was a beautiful Mountain Laurel forest surrounding the river. The crossing rocks were covered from all the rain but no problems, the trail was so wet our shoes were soaked, so we walked on through. Shortly after crossing Justice Creek we pass 4 oriental day hikers they had come from Gooch Gap, after talking a while we went on towards Gooch Mtn Shelter. We passed it planning to head to Woody gap as quickly as possible. We had already stopped and had a peanut butter wrap just before the shelter. The next 4.5 miles after crossing Gooch gap we ran into some major wind with a rain and snow mix. The wind was blowing pretty solid and we were happy to arrive at Woody Gap around 3pm. We put dry clothes on in the restrooms and sat in our car. We had parked it at Woody the day before. We checked the radar and several tornado watches had been issued. We decided to go to Seasons Inn  in Blairsville for the night. When the storm hit we were happy with our decision.","Hightower Gap

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625730,"It was so calm at Woody Gap this Morning, a full moon over the trees with a clear sky. We Left Woody Gap 745am and it was 47* and clear out. A very different story than the day before. The trail was nice and we had a  climb up to Preachers Rock and we were rewarded with a fantastic view. The sun was rising and you could see forever with pockets of fog hidden in the valleys. There was another young couple taking in the sunrise and Subman reminded them to be careful a lot of folks choose to get married here. We continued to go over Cedar Mountain and the views continued to not disappoint, the Sun threw starburst through the trees and it was a wonderful morning. I had not been through this section since my 2016 thru and I had forgotten how nice the trail was. we worked our way down Cedar Mountain and four trail runners passed us by heading to Blood Mountain. Having them pass us by it reminded me why we were hiking, to regain our strength and a healthy weight while having a blast. Not to mention how much clarity for your mind comes from being out here. After crossing Lance Creek we began our climb towards blood mountain with a gain of about 1500 feet over 5 miles. we would climb then level out then climbed some more. Four miles past Lance creek we come to Woods Hole Shelter. We did not go in and Subman said he had stayed there in 2003. We got water at the Slaughter creek trail spring, There a group of Ten Hikers traveling with an Alanta Hiking group meet up with us and continued up to the summit, We finished getting our water and followed them to the top. Right before  reaching the summit, we ran into a hiker I was hoping to meet, Anubis. He is a SOBO Hiking Thru and hopefully will be A Thru-Hiker by Monday. His Appendics had burst in Erwin and after surgery instead of going home he got back on the trail. He fought his way back to health and cleaned out his budget getting to Springer. We told Him about the free showers and shelter behind the visitors center and he could wait there for his friend to come Thursday to pick him up. I found his spirit very inspiring. At the summit we had a snack and took pictures. Blood Mountain was a very busy place. Following the blazes down to the rocky decent it was muddy and water flowed freely on the trail. The rocks were slippery and huge and we were tired, but excited to almost be at Neel Gap, we had reached our goal for this three day outing. At Neel Gap we had called Donald At Further Shuttle to take us back to our car at Woody Gap. Mary was at Mountain Crossings waiting for us and gave us a free shuttle! great trail magic! Now it is time to head home, Subman got Pepper from Our Friend Grambo. I Thank her so much for always being there for us. Pepper will go back to stay with her in a couple days so we can go back out for five days. We really enjoy hearing the encouraging words from our quest book, although we may not answer all individually we love hearing from you and it helps. Great to hear from those that followed us in 2016, we remember you, and you helped us to make it thru!","Woody gap

It is a pretty good climb up coming out of Mt crossing  and with four hours sleep, my batteries were running low, but we made it to the trail and hoping to get to Dicks Creek Gap this weekend. Im so happy because we are in our tent and listening to the tree rain as it splatters above is. We use a zpak duplex and we both have western mountaineering terralite sleeping bags it is very cozy. We each had a wrap for dinner. We were set up by 630 and in the tent for hiker midnight. Now I have to listen to Subman say what time is sunrise?. We should just night hike.

It was coming down pretty good and lots of wind. We got on the trail at 715am and it was still drizzling rain and very foggy the temps were great and would have been a nice day had the wind chill been better.  As we were coming down from Wolf Laurel Top there was spitting snow and lots of wind. We put on our frogg togg jackets and I put on my wool hat and broke out the ski mittens. That was the trail until Hogpen gap when the Sun popped out and the wind died down. We were sheltered from the wind and we could see out into the mountains. A beautiful day. Subman wanted to camp at chattahoochee gap because it is sheltered from the wind so today we did a respectable 12 miles. We had a mountainhouse dinner and shared a mudslide to warm us up. Now we are tucked into our sleeping bags and nice and toasty. It is supposed to get cold tonight so we are also using our down quilted liners.,"Wolf laurel Top

After looking at the weather and seeing that Saturday was supposed to be in the 40*s  and rain, We decided that we needed to get as far as we could towards Dicks Creek Gap. We were hoping for at least past Tray Mountain. We took off from Chattahoochee Gap before sunrise. Submans' headlamp broke so he was using it gingerly until the sun came up. We were treated to a beautiful Sunrise. We went on a couple  of Miles and went into Blue Mountain Shelter, Subman Made me another cup of coffee. The shelter was spotless and so was the Privy. The Maintainers had just been there and it was evident where they had worked on the trail. A big Thank You to All those Maintainers who put in countless hours for our enjoyment. We continued on up Blue Mountain  Before heading straight down into Unicoi Gap. a thousand feet in one mile decent, In the process of coming down I took my first Spill. I went Snap Crackle Pop. But in the end everything was in its place. crossing the road  We started the 1000 ft ascent Of Rocky Mountain only to descend into Indian Grave Gap, coming into the gap there is a beautiful staircase that Im sure is one of the finest on the AT. We crossed the cheese Factory campsite and headed up the long climb to Tray Mountain. We stop at Tray Mountain and Had a Hot Mountain House Lunch of Lasagna and Sub threw in some dried vegetables that Wrong Way had given him. It tasted so good. Now that we had powered up we wanted to push on to see how far we could get We made it into Sassafras Gap at around 5pm and We were tired. We Had heard that is was supposed to be 30* in Hiawassee so it would be even colder in the mountains.

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625847,"We had a little over six miles to get into Dicks Creek Gap. It was supposed to be in the 40s and raining after 10am , those are dangerous conditions,so we wanted to get in before the rain started. We took off just before sunrise. We first came down into Addis Gap and depending what side of the mountain we were on it was a very cold wind. We had a lot of layers on along with our mittens on. It was a drizzly fog that created ice on our packs and our drinking water to freeze. We next climbed Submans Nemesis Kelly Knob, My saber rattling was weak this morning, but up we went ever so slowly. I went to one tree and stopped and then to another tree and so on until we finally reached the summit. We went down past Deep Gap shelter and continued up to the vista. We were out of the wind so we took a moment to eat a bar and drink some ice water. We now had a little energy to make the next 3 miles into Dicks Creek. It was a gentle descent along Laurel Tunnels and even a little waterfall tucked into the Rhododendrons. We had made it right before the rain started to fall. The Southern Ruck was this weekend at Vogel State Park. We stopped in to Say Hello to Tramily and Saw SmokeStack and Mother Nature, Odie, BearCharmer, Purple, Judy Lightheart, Sunset,even Braces with BandAides was there.

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625904,Yesterday I went to the courthouse in the hopes of getting a deferment for my Jury Duty next Monday the 27th. As luck would have it The Clerk that I spoke with Knew what a Thru Hike was and loved the Appalachian Trail. They gave me a deferment and told me to check in when I got back. That was a big relief. Now we have options for this weekend we are trying to settle the dog sitting and I am trying to work my schedule so we have enough time to get to Franklin. The devil is in the details so we are hoping for the best. If we can go out this weekend we can make it to Fontana by my quit date of Feb. 13th. This would give us a free schedule to watch the weather before going into the Smokies. Subman is an excellent planner and is great about planning not only the imminent trip but also what advantages can be gain by hiking to certain trailheads. This is a nice talent to have when it comes to resupplies and hitting certain landmarks along the trail. So here is hoping we go out Friday! Going North!,"Home

This is where we hit a Blizzard in 2016 and it was a big mental game for me we pushed on past the high wind with a chilling element that took your breathe over Courthouse Bald. As we went up you could see how the wind plastered even the weed stalks with snow and ice. It was a solid climb  and we continued on to Muskrat Creek Shelter where we stop to to have sandwiches it was so cold we didn't stay long and were on our way. We continued on for 4 more miles in these frozen conditions until we came to our planned stop for the night Deep Gap. It was supposed to be 25* in Haiwassee tonight so we planned for 20*. We were settled in our tent and ready for the evening When Subman said his back was cold.  I mentioned I had an Emergency Blanket in my pack and we put it under his mattress. This seemed to help a lot and we stayed toasty warm the rest of the evening. we were glad we had our quilted down inserts to put in our 25* WM sleeping bags. we were in our Duplex Zpaks Tent and had it battened down tight.","Plum Orchard

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625974,"This was a big Physical day but also a Big Mental Day for me. In 2016 we hit a Blizzard at Standing Indian It was crazy cold out and I was freaking out and non Functional. Poor Subman got our water and cooked in frigid temps. I was convinced that my hike was a charity Mission and I was done. Moon Beam was there and gave me the pep talk I needed about I walked every step there and I deserved to be there. It was so cold I was quitting I was calling Grambo and the next way out I was gone. Thankfully my Trail Family convinced me We could do this and With the help of our Trail Angel Trail Chef I stayed on Trail and finished my Thru hike. Today was so different going over Standing Indian. It was cold around 25* with wind chill, but I had learned a lot since 2016 we had the right gear and I knew how to use it. I had my t-shirt, polar fleece, and frogg togg jacket with a buff and my wool hat. My bottoms were shorts with Frogg Togg pants on top and I was warm. The Frogg Toggs do a great job of cutting the wind. Keep in mind these are the Frogg Toggs that are heavier weight than the ones at wal-mart these are found at Bass Pro type stores and cost about 30$ each piece. It was cold but our SApirits were High today, it was the first day out that we actually had a view. You could see forever as we went past Standing Indian and headed down to Carter Gap Shelter. Subman had made a Chili Mountainhouse for us and the hot lunch did Us good we had four more miles to our planned stop Bettys Gap. For some reason Carter Gap Shelter had a lot of trash everywhere it was to much to pack out. we continued on to Bettys Creek Gap and we set up our tent among the Rhododendrons and around 9pm a small group came in to make camp. we had encountered about 5 hikers making the rock Gap to Deep Gap loop and hiking the trail down to Standing Indian Campground. As we set up camp we were hoping for a warmer night than the night at Deep Gap but it was supposed to rain so we will see.","Deep gap

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625975,We were on the trail by 830am and today's nemesis was Albert Mountain. within 2.5 miles. There was a little snow flakes but the weather was good. We Hit the climb to Albert Mountain and some how I had forgotten how straight up the climb to the rock scrabbles were. slow but sure we made our way up and we were blessed with no ice or snow sticking to the rocks. Subman loves this stuff  and he scrabbled right up. I cautiously followed him slowly. There was no view at the top  but we snapped a few 100 mile pics and continued down to glassmine Gap. It started to snow and it was quietly beautiful as we meandered down to Rock Gap passing Rock Gap Shelter. In 2016 there was a storm and A blowdown hit the front of the Rock Gap Shelter. the group of three Hikers in the shelter that night became the Near Miss group. there were a lot of blow downs today as we continued up winding stair after Wallace Gap there were several blow Downs that you had to go around and one that I had to crawl under on my hands and knees. It is early in the season and hopefully our wonderful maintainers have a chance to get out there before the bubble hits.  As we came into winding Stair Bushy and Sparks  two Hikers we met in 2017 had recently moved to Franklin. They made the generous offer to shuttle us back to our car at Dicks Creek Gap. We got to their car and they greeted us with Hot Chocolate sandwiches and chips and anything else you could think of. It was great to see them again and the trip back to Dicks Creek Gap was to short to catch up on all the news. we will have to get together after this hike but it was great to see them again and we were certainly blessed to have them help us today! we are home and enjoyed a relaxing hot tub for our sore muscles and plan to get back out Wednesday with our friend Compass who plans to join us for a hike!,"Bettys Creek Gap

She had three days off and wanted to stomp some dirt with us. Sub and I had dinner at the Riverside Restaurant while waiting for Compass. We left Compass' car at the NOC and brought her home with us.

Subman and Compass were to Pick me up from work and Take our dog Pepper, to Grambos house. My boss called and said there was a Semi overturned on her way to work she was running late. So Sub dropped off Pepper and came back to get me. We were off. Just outside of Ellijay Subman realizes he forgot his Frogg Togg Jacket, A must have in this weather. We turned around and made the trip back home to get it. After retrieving Subs Jacket we make the 2 hour trip to Winding Stair. After Arriving at Winding Stair Gap, Compass reaches in the back seat and her face drops, She had left her Hiking Shoes in my car back at the Ellijay ER parking lot. She wants to go to Outdoor 76 and get a new pair so she can hike. They didnt have her shoes but, I began to tell them about my blister and arch issues and they Hooked me up with a new Soloman Odyssey triple crown shoe with a large toe box and I could get my custom Orthotics in them. They felt great! But, Compass still needed Hiking shoes. So off we go to NOC, she thinks she has a pair in her car. After getting to NOC she finds she doesnt have any in her car, so she runs over to the NOC outfitter and they hook her up with the latest and greatest Altras. Now we are set and head back to Winding Stair Gap. By this time it is 3pm and I had been up 36 hours. We planned a short 6 mile trek into the Wayah Crest Picnic Area. We climbed for 4.5 miles to 5000ft to get to Siler Bald. There was snow as we got to Snowbird and Panther Gap The Sun never hits this side of the mountain. I love Siler Bald it is where my First night on the AT was spent on a freezing March Night. It is getting Late so we pass the opportunity to climb the bald. If you get a chance I highly suggest it. You can see 360* from the top and Sunrise is phenomenal. We continue for another mile and get to the Wayah Crest Picnic area. this is an excellent spot for a late out from Franklin NC. It was level and had picnic tables to use. I was exhausted and we quickly got camp set up and I went straight to bed.

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626029,"We got a lazy start to our day and left camp at 830am. It was a cold night but, a comfortable 34* day for hiking. We started off in our cold weather clothes and soon began shedding them as we climbed up to Wayah Bald Tower. There were trash cans and restrooms and we each walked up to the tower at our own pace. We took in the  View and I went up into the tower. This was the first time I had been at Wayah Bald since the fires. The scorched trees covered such a large area. I went down from the tower and we all had a sandwich. We packed up and continued down to the Wayah Bald Shelter. We stopped in and used the privy. We passed burning town Gap, which looks like a popular meeting place that some could drive in to camp. We climbed up 4900 ft to Cold Springs Shelter. There is always snow and Ice here. The shelter was built in the 1930's by the CCC. Compass stops to have some trail mix and Sub and I continue on to our goal of Tellico Gap. About 2 miles from the gap we filled our water bottles for camp. The Big Branch campsite we were going to use was very muddy, but Subman thought there may be one at Tellico gap, So we passed it up. Tellico Gap did not offer any tent sites so we began to climb thinking there was a site up the trail. It was a sidetrail around the mountain so no level camping until we were almost to the top of Wesser Bald. While standing at the Wesser Bald Tower the decision was made to go to the Wesser Bald Shelter. It was Getting dark so we all got our Headlamps out to night hike into the shelter. It was a long day and we had already hiked 14miles with fully loaded water uphill at the end of the day. We finally made it to the shelter fixed a hot dinner and got into bed. we were all bushed.","Wayah Crest Picnic area

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626030,"This morning Compass mentions she thought a deer came into the shelter last  night. I also had heard something during the night go by the tent. Yesterday we had seen adult Deer prints in the snow followed by the tiniest baby hoof prints perhaps it was the same deer. We were on the trail by 730am and today we had a steep down into NOC. For the first mile we had a phenomenal ridge walk that was as wide as the path and pretty much nothing else. It was a little rocky and scattered with some branches from the harsh winter. It was precarious but nothing like the Jump off point Which took a sharp turn down large boulders to begin the steep 4 miles down. I slipped on a wet root and went down. Nothing to do but brush it off and go on. I was so sore from the miles yesterday Doubt and disappointment began to seep in as I slowly brought up the rear of our group. Subman was very patient and always waits for me, I was creating an anxiety in my head of how long would his patience last. My feet were doing better with my new shoes, but I tweaked my knee coming down the trail and now another issue has presented itself, I was getting frustrated. I told Subman about my fears and he quietly reassured me he would wait and to remember why I was out here. Things would get easier the more we hiked and got stronger. I cant believe how much my body had changed in the 4 short years since I last hiked. I have a lot of work to do. Subman and I walked the last quarter mile together into NOC. we meet Compass at the Riverside Restaurant and had a hot lunch. Compass took us back to Winding Stair Gap to our car. A mouse had been inside with little pieces of litter around so the saga continues.... We will be off trail for over a week now so Subman can take Pepper to New York to stay with His Niece Alisha and her children. He will stay a few days to get Pepper acclimated to being there. After Sub flies home, we have an appointment to get our taxes done, then we will be free after the 13th of Feb. my last day of employment.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Leaving my job was the hardest decision I had to make for hiking the trail. Everybody is staying connected by Facebook and they have a trail map hanging in the Lab to follow along. Their support will be very encouraging along our hike. Subman will pick me up after work in the Morning and we will get back on trail at the NOC. we are hoping to make it to Stecoah gap, then on to Fontana Dam. Shortly after we discussed our plans the Phone rings and Butter, a Hiking friend that Subman met on the Benton MacKaye trail, was checking in to see what our plans were. after a brief discussion Butter offers to take us up to the Smokies on Monday! Now there has been more than a few times on trail that Devine intervention has happened, We were just getting ready to call the shuttle driver. In Franklin NC, Sparks and Bushy stepped right in to help us get back to Dicks Creek, we didn't even know they were in Franklin, NC.  Karma is real and the Trail Angels are really amazing people. All of our Adulting is done taxes, work, etc. Pepper is staying in a more familiar place, Subman decided to Take her to Florida, so she could be with Submans Sister, Kathy, Jim and their dog Dixie. Pepper  has visited there often with us so we thought she may adjust there better .

I slept in the car on the way there for about an hour. We hit the trail at 950am and for the the first seven miles it is straight up! We passed a memorial dedicated to Wade Sutton, A ranger who died suppressing a wildfire. We didnt have any coins to leave so I left my blue ladybug rock that I had found coming into NOC.   We passed 2 sobos one speeding past and the other stopping to talk a bit, Sidewinder from New Jersey was enjoying his Hike and took a lot of blue blazes. We continued to climb even more up past the JumpUp where you can take in a view of the whole Natahala Gorge.  We had a sandwich here and enjoyed the view. We past Sassafras Shelter and continued to climb one foot in front of the other. I used the tree game a lot today. Just make it to a tree that I picked out, then you get ten breaths of rest. That ten Breaths goes fast when you are sucking wind from going uphill! And we continue to go up a 800ft in one mile on the climb to Cheoah Blad. We had a beautiful day for views And you could see forever. Subman called Stecoah Wolfcreek Hostel and talked to Lonnie, He secured a bed for us in the Hostel, So we needed to get to Stecoah Gap. We had 5 more miles to go down into Stecoah Gap. We were trying  to get into a hostel since the temps were supposed to be in the single digits with the wind chill. After Climbing all day I was losing steam fast. I had been up over 24 hours and five miles doesnt sound like much but I was near exhaustion. there were blowdowns that I could hardly get my legs to reach over, My hips hurt from all the climbing and I had a knee acting up. I was a hot mess. All of these issue are from overuse and overweight. As soon as I drop some of this weight a lot of my aches and pains will not be an issue. So I am a work in progress. We continue to slowly come into Stecoah Gap. I am so slow and Subman is so so patient. He brings me his headlamp and puts it on my head and slowly walks me out to the gap with kindness and encouraging words he gets  us down the stairs to the gap. Lonnie, from the hostel, is waiting there for us and pulls his truck over to the stairs to shed more light for us. We thank him for his patience and continue back to his hostel. It is Perfect, a home for Hikers, the whole house, Kitchen, a clean bath, and queen beds in all the rooms. When we go in Quicksand is there, A hiker that Subman Knew and had Hiked a little with. we exchanged hellos and caught up on each others hikes. Quicksand is flip flopping and will end his hike when he reaches Daleville, VA.  Shadow was there and Helping Lonnie with running the hostel, a very pleasant fellow. Sub and I retire to our room very Soon after arriving. He makes the Bed up and I get in the shower, The hot water felt wonderful on my aching body, I come back to our room and Subman had made me a Beef Stroganoff Mountainhouse, My favorite. I didnt have much of an appetite but I ate half of it. I curled up in Bed and Subman took care of everything else, I was dead to the world.","NOC

We also got a breakfast sandwich to pack out. Lonnie the Hostel owner took us back to Stecoah Gap. It was cold so I had my frogg togg pants on and three layers. within 1 mile we were climbing Jacobs ladder {800ft within a mile}, so we warmed up pretty quickly. My knee was bothering me so I stopped and applied KT tape. The tape has helped a lot with overuse injuries. We passed Brown Fork Gap shelter but did not go in. After Jacobs Ladder we had several rollers and ridges to climb. A couple of the rollers had steep rocky descents that I took very slowly. The clear skies gave us beautiful views along the ridges. five miles in we descend into Hogback Gap . The sign for the gap looked like it was being eaten by the tree, there is a picture of it in the gallery. After a little climb we descended even further down to Cable Gap Shelter. We stopped for lunch and had our breakfast sandwiches. There were 5 young Section Hikers there doing a section from Stecoah to Fontana. Shortly after Subman and I arrived Quicksand came in and we all talked a bit before the young Hikers took off and  Subman and I followed shortly thereafter. Quicksand said he was going to stealth somewhere before Fontana to time out meeting his wife in Newfound Gap. We had a climb out of the Shelter but it was the last major climb for the day and it was nice trail. I was feeling pretty good in comparison to yesterday. We worked our way down to the Fontana Marina at HWY 28 and had two more miles to go until the Visitor Center. At the marina there is a memorial from BamaHikers wife asking hikers to help take pebbles to complete BamaHikers quest. Both Subman and I took a pebble to carry to Katahdin. The last 2 miles I was energized and the views along the coast of the dam was breathtaking. soon we popped out to the Fontana Hilton. There was a full house at the shelter tonight including our 5 young hikers we saw previously. We said our greetings and continued to walk to the dam Visitors center where our Shuttle back to NOC was waiting for us. We got our car at NOC and came home.

Continuing on we come to the park entry and deposited our permits before Beginning our 2000ft climb to Shuckstack Fire Tower. We stopped at a rock scrabble and ate a quick sandwich. Just before reaching the summit of Shuckstack. We will need the energy to climb to Mollies Ridge Shelter which is Another 800ft higher. We got to Mollies Ridge at 215pm and ate a snack. We felt good so we decided to head to the next shelter, Russell Field. The shelter was a mere 3 miles away but had a 1 mile climb to it at the end of the day. Subman and I fist bump at the shelter.

At first it was light showers off and on by the time we hit Rocky top(4miles) it was a steady downpour. After crossing over Thunderhead mountain we went down into Starky Gap and crossed a 300ft roller to sugar tree gap. We were soaked and cold and thought a warm lunch would help so we stopped in Derrick knob shelter. It seems like you have to climb up to all the shelters which is very hard when your tired and need a rest. Subman made beef stroganoff, my favorite , trying to entice me to eat. I was able to eat a cup of the noodles and that was it,  we continued on with rollers with the steepest one being cold Spring knob. After decending the knob we began our climb into Silers bald shelter. We were soaked and spread out our dripping clothes since we were alone in the shelter.

It was getting hard to function without nutrition. I was managing sucking on lifesavers so that is what I made it into NewFound Gap on. After Clingmans there is a long downhill and 2 climbs with Mt Collins being the bigger of the 2. There was still Mingus ridge 1.5 miles after that. At this point I was digging deep to get over Mingus Ridge. We had a trail angel Barbara Allen waiting for us at New Found Gap. She met me on the trail and we walked out together. Barbara lives in Knoxville and drove 2 hours to be there for us. She also helped 2 hikers before us get into Gatlinburg. This was greatly appreciated with the impending snow and cold temps coming. We went to dinner at the Smokey Mtn. Brewery then she took us to the Lodge of Legends hostel. It is a beautiful home on the outskirts of Gatlinburg.

The podiatrist suggested I ditch the custom orthotics and go with power step inserts. I have been using them while home and I believe they will work for me. We plan to return to New Found Gap on Thursday. The thought behind our date to return is that there has been 8+ inches of fresh snow with freezing and melting causing ice. We are hoping the next couple days of rain will help melt the snow and ice. The hard part of the park is done and truthfully it about did me in. I feel confident going into the North side of the park and that helps to calm the nerves a bit. We will not have to push 15 miles over huge climbs to get to our shelter.

I could not make myself wake up since my biological clock is a 6am riser at the very least. Sub laid back down and we napped a little longer. We left camp at 830 to a straight climb up to Max Patch. It was a beautiful day, the sun was shinning and we made a hot lunch, sat and soaked it up. We continued along after passing Roaring Fork shelter, Subman slips on a log step and goes down hard, thats his 3rd fall for the AT. He just shook it off. About 2 miles out from Lemon Gap. 2 southbound hikers said there was Trail Magic at Lemon Gap. We put a Spring in our step hoping to catch it. About 1 mile out I fell. Hit my knee but brushed it off. We are now 3 to 3 for AT falls. We made it to lemon Gap and ""Just Dave"" had great trail magic. I loved that there was a wash hands station. While there I noticed a huge goose egg on my knee. Just Dave gave me some ice and we sat by his fire and chatted. He is a ROTC teacher and hikes in the summer months doing long lashes. He plans to finish his AT hike this year. We thanked him for the trail magic and began the long climb up Walnut Mountain at the top the sun was warm and a clearing that we could sit and soak it up. There was a signal so I could post my trail journal. While I did that Subman set up our tent and started dinner. I went way down a hill to get our water. We are set for the night. Last night there was a bright full moon and an owl that hooted loudly. We have been so fortunate with the beautiful weather and easy trail.","Brown Gap

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626762,"I woke to a whisper saying ""I will make you the best coffee you ever tasted"" Subman was trying to entice me awake. It was 630am and I tried to tell him that was like 530am before daylight savings time. Slowly I got myself to wake up and have a cup of coffee and begin the day. We left camp at 730am and the sunrise was coming up over Bluff Mountain, the mornings are beautiful on the trail, birds singing, I heard an owl hooting his morning greeting. The moon has been so full and bright the last 2 nights you didnt even need a headlamp.We had 13 miles to Hot Springs, warm food,  hot showers, clean clothes, town was calling. We both love Hot Springs and we were looking forward to getting there. We started off climbing Bluff Mountain, a 1000ft climb over 2 miles. The 4 mile downhill was mild  and the weather was great, we got to Garenflo Gap and stopped for a break. Shortly after leaving Garenflo Gap we came upon Squire who was hiking with his children, Eli, Who took the trail name Ghost from Subman, and his daughter Willow, both under the age of 12. We passed Deer Park Mountain Shelter which meant we had 3 miles to Hot Springs. 1 mile to Hot Springs we met a thru-hiker (2000) named Shepard, he was dayhiking and carrying a few extra Sodas for hikers that he passed. We arrived in Hot springs around 3pm and tented at Laughing Heart Hostel. Tie and Solo have done wonders with the hostel and it has everything you need. We immediately start knocking out town chores, showers, laundry, resupply lists, then walk to town for dinner by 6pm. We enjoyed dinner at the Spring Creek Tavern and returned to the hostel for hiker midnight. The moon is bright and full again tonight.","Walnut mountain shelter

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626780,"we are tenting at Laughing heart and taking a zero day. We got up early and had breakfast at the smokey mountain diner and went to Bluff Mountain outfitters for a few items then to the dollar store for resupply. We got a bottle of wine and some cheese and crackers. We enjoyed these while sitting in rocking chairs on the patio visiting with Fresh Ground, Skip snd Twinkle Toes. Solo and Tie are awesome hosts and add a lot of personality to the laughing heart. We are fed and rested and will head out for Erwin, TN tomorrow.","Hot Springs

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626821,"We took off from Laughing Heart Hostel at 630am and went to the Smokey Mountain Diner for breakfast. We crossed through town and the Trail took us on the North bank of the French Broad River. We climed Lovers Leap and had views of Hot Springs, Lovers Leap is a pretty rocky and steep climb (over 1000ft), but it was early and we were strong. It was another beautiful day! I had a little anxiety leaving town, you catch up on the news while in town and I quess the conclusion is its a great year to be hiking. We pass a pond that had mist sweeping over it and frogs filling the air with their song, it felt like spring. We crossed over US70 on a overpass and I watched as cars zoomed by even waving at them like a child. We had a 1300ft climb up Rich mountain, almost to the top we meet a local Father Daughter who were out for a four day section. They talked about the fire tower on top of the mountain and convinced Sub he should take the side trail to see it. It was another 0.2 climb up, he dropped his pack with me and I got us water while he went up. Heights are not my thing, but Subman loves them. Subman said it was newer tower built mostly of metal,  even the floor was metal grating, and he said you could see Hot Springs below. We crossed several Forest service roads and saw 2 grave markers that were relatively new from the 1990s. We climb up to Spring Mountain Shelter and it was around 3pm. Green Spork with his beautiful Huskey/malamute Dog Dakota was there along with his travel campanions, Cakes and Boots. We had a hot meal of Knorr broccoli and cheese beefed up with ramen noodles and peanut M&Ms for dessert. I was finally getting my appetite back. While we were eating, the Australian team Skip and Twinkle Toes arrived. Everyone here had been at Laughing Heart Hostel last night. Subman and I decide to push on a couple of miles to Deep Gap. The Spring there was dry but I followed the dry creek bed to a very nice stream although it was twice as far away from our site and down a steep gully. Subman had set up our tent while I was gone. We had a snack and was settled in our tent by 7pm, there had been quite a bit of climbing today we were tired but hiked strong, i think we are getting into our hiker groove.","Hot springs

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626905,"We started out with headlamps at 7am from Deep Gap, the moon was still out with the sun rising in the east. We went about a mile and saw a man walking up the trail. It was Fresh Ground taking a walk! He had parked his Leap Frog cafe at Allen Gap. That meant an awesome breakfast to fuel us up. We needed it, we had a 2500ft climb for the next 5 miles. After climbing we wound our way up to Firescald Knob. A one and a half mile boulder scramble that followed a ridge with open ridgeline with views  of Big Bald and surround mountains and valleys. There was some technical areas and it took quite a while for us to work our way through it. We had almost 2 miles before the shelter. I was thankful for the nice trail after all the rocks and roots today. Jerry Cabin shelter is small and a group of 3 men were settled in there was also 3 ladies who came up a side trail to spend the night on the AT. Skip and Twinkle Toes are also here tonight tenting nearby.","Deep Gap

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626906,"We had a bad Thunderstorm last night, lightening and high winds,with rain. We were fine in our tent and most of the rain had subsided as we left camp at 715am. I wore my poncho since there was still scattered rain and tree rain. We climbed 700 ft up Big Butt Mountain. On the summit there were two rocks with a split down the center. I supposed that was the mountains namesake. We ran into a Rock scramble. Although it was wet, it was much smaller than the 1.5 mile scramble at Firescald. Subman said he felt off today, a little worn out. My legs were a little rubbery from the rock scrambles. We continued down a 3 mile 1300ft descent to flint gap. It was .3 miles up to the Flint Mountain shelter. While we stopped ito the shelter for a break Skip and Twinkle Toes passed by, we waved a greeting and Skip filled me in on the weather forcast. After our break we continued on to Devil Fork Gap where Fresh Ground was cooking cheeseburgers for everyone. Rocky from the class of 2013 was visiting Fresh Ground as he feed Subman and I along with Skip and Twinkle Toes. We were fueled up So we were ready for the 2000ft climb up to lick rock. As we climbed there was a waterfall that we crossed several times. After coming over Lick Rock summit we went down 1 mile to Big Flat Campsite. Subman said we are stopping here, he was tired. We quickly set up camp and since we ate at the leap Frog Cafe we didnt cook tonight. Fresh Ground really helped us out on our way to Erwin!","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626941,"Today we left before dawn walking by headlamp for the first 2 miles. After 3 miles we passed HogPen Shelter, the sign said we had 2.4 miles to Sam's Gap. We were exhausted last night after just 13 miles. We were worn out, there has been a lot of climbing this section. After discussing our options, Subman and I decided on going to Uncle Johnny's for a zero to rest up. We will return to Sam's Gap Monday and continue to Erwin. We found Fresh Ground at Sams Gap and after he fed the hikers he was going to Erwin for a day off. We appreciated the ride to Uncle Johnnys from Fresh Ground. The Leap Frog Cafe is always a welcome sight! For now we are looking forward to the rest.
Note to Brenda: I could not respond to you without a valid email but I wanted to say thank you for sharing the wonderful memory of Stronghold. Many prayers and love to you and all of Strongholds family. Stronghold is the type of hiker that makes the the AT community as wonderful as it is. ATStrong ?❤","Big Flat Campground

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627010,"Today Subman and I are getting a rental car to come home. We will end our hike. We are well, but we are worn out. we are slow and the bubble will catch up soon.  The virus situation causes me anxiety about hostel closures and resupply issues, although we have had no problems yet, hostel and parks have started closing. We are at a good exit point to leave the trail. We have chosen to go home before it becomes a hard to handle situation. We have enjoyed our hike together and will always return to the AT. Thank you for following along and all your kindness and support.","Uncle johnnys
