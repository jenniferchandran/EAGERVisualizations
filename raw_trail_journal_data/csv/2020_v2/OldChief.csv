OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626454,"Took off today to gather up some gear in the little town of Wellsboro, Pennsylvania called Wild Asaph Outfitters. The nearest REI is more than 2 hours away and I like to support local businesses if I can. You know, the Mom and Pop shops! With my  Osprey Levity 45L back pack in tow, Jenny waited on me. She is so knowledgeable. Guess what! She hiked the AT twenty years ago! I was able to pick out my tent and she showed me how to set it up. I chose a Marmot  1 person tent. Next was the sleeping bag. Boy what a feat that was! Glad I crawled in that tent with it. The bag I chose was not comfortable and was a right hand zip. I definetly need a left hand zip and even though I'm a short little guy, these shoulders are not met for this bag! So I guess I will be going to an REI to find a bag that is a better fit fir me. Still was able to get my titanium 20oz cup/pot, a spork, rain gear, water container, 2 different sizes of nylon cord and my new best friends, my hiking boots!  I chose the Oboz Firebrand ll with inserts and am in the process of breaking them in for the trail.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Sat",0

My Mother in law snuck off to my AT gear and supply room to check things out.  She was surprised on the few things I was taking with me (I'm going ultra light). She held and pondered each item and was impressed how little things weighed.  So I think I have my Mother in laws approval. No Mom, I am not fitting you in the pack or carrying you 2,200 miles! My retirement party is this Friday.  We are cooking 3 prime ribs, smoking 2 briskets, roasted potatoes, my wife's amazing bake beans and my sister is making my Moms home made dinner rolls (RIP Mom, I know you'll be on the trail with me).",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Wed",0

Many memories of the fun and work we had . My job as a technician was to take care of problems from stray voltage , theft of service, energy audits ,generators, geothermal, collections, electric safety displays for the public and yes even carry tools for a lineman across a creek to a pole during storms . If you had a problem then that became my problem. My retirement party was awesome yesterday with my coworkers and family sharing stories and laughs . We cooked 3 prime ribs and 2 smoked brisket. We topped off our meal with yummy cake .
See you folks on the trail",,View Entry,"Feb 29, Sat",0
OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626522,"My manhood was called out last night by my nephew to camp out with him at 19 degrees and 30 mph winds . I did exactly that to test my gear . I set a tarp on top of 12 inches of snow and set up my one person marmot tent . We had to pile snow on the edge of the tarp to keep it from flying away . I added a Eddie Bauer pad and then my 20 degree field and stream sleeping bag . I had to jump in the tent to keep it on the ground and I pointed my feet towards the wind !
Wow it was fun , the wind howled across the field and the temps dropped to 13 degrees . My tent did not let any wind in except when the direction changed towards the flap . I was snug as a bug and woke about 8:00 am . I didn’t want to go inside but my bladder said to go . Lol",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Sun",0

My objective last night was to get my new sleeping bag and pad from the flagship REI store in DC before they closed . Wow , what a store with all the latest gadgets and outdoor gear for fun .

OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626914,"When my son eldest son, Scott left the trail after my first day and night, I thought my orientation was done. Little did I know it was just beginning.  What a few days it has been since I last posted. Matter of fact, my previous entry was just a ""hey I'm alive and I'll catch up with you later when I figure out how to manage all this!"" 
I started out of Gooch Gap on Tuesday and it was about 13 miles to Blood Mountain with a lot of rain. I was almost to the top of the mountain and had been hiking with two college kids. It was getting dark. I didn't see a shelter anywhere so I started to set up my tent as the guys hiked off trail to their car.  One of the boys hollered that the shelter was about 100 yards on up the trail. Boy I was happy to get in that dry shelter.  I placed my bear vaul, with the food in it, outside of the shelter. My headlamp batteries were now dead and no extras in my pack. I found my bag and pad and settled in for what I was hoping as a good nights sleep. Well I barely slept all night long, I swore I kept hearing bears!
I woke up Wednesday morning with a plan for a 2 mile hike to Neels Gap. Well that plan shattered as I somehow wandered off course and down a rocky slope.  Watching my foot placement and what seemed like a trail I found myself at the bottom of a rivine. This was not the trail. Realizing, none to soon,  I was off course I turned back to climb up (way up) the mountain.  I had to claw at the rocks to get back to the top. Exhausted and hungry I walked the 2 miles to Neels Gap which turned out to be 8 miles out of my way. 
Dragging into Neels Gap I was happy to find three guys I have hiked with (George, Al and Parker) who were all willing to share the cost of a cabin. It was warm , dry and they washed and dried our dirty laundry.  We stayed in Raccoon Cabin and I quickly realized it had a stove!  After we hung out our stuff to dry we grabbed a ride to town to a Wal-Mart. I bought steaks, sausage, eggs and English muffins. No trail food tonight! Back at the cabin I made steaks and our bellies were full. Parker is an Englishman with the most awesome beard and mustache ever.  He reminds me of a Captain off an old ship. He now calls me Old Chef instead of Old Chief. 
The morning brought us drier weather to start and with sausage, egg and muffin breakfast sandwiches in our bellies we headed for Low Gap.
This would be a 11 mile hike with rain on the horizon, again.
I am much more rested today. I met an AT trail celebrity today. PAPPY! He thru hiked the AT a few years ago. He is 89 years old!  I told him I was glad to meet a celebrity like him.  His reply, ""awe- don't give me a big head!""
Visiting with him was a real boost. I had read about him and some of his adventures. This motivated me to move on.
There are a variety of people on the trail but It seems everyone has the same goal.
To escape from the busy life of today and to get to Katahdin.
I have talked to many who worked in Information Technology and they just need to get away. Ironic to me to go from technology to the natural life of the trail. 
Even though it is hard I am finding it does require some level of organization (don't laugh) and the weather can not be planned.  This is the best decision I have ever made.","Gooch Gap, Blood Mountain

OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626915,"Started my day with cold brew coffee and the last hiker to leave camp for the trail. Bob the Builder is one of the hikers who was staying behind taking a Zero Day to give his knee a rest. I gave him my number and told him to call if he needed anything. 
As I passed the shelter to get my water I saw a bag of trash tied up sitting there. Ugh. Can't leave that here. After I gathered my gear I dragged the extra 3 lb bag of trash with me. I heard there may be ""trail magic"" (people who come and volunteer to give some comfort and support on the trail such as hotdogs, hot cocoa, etc) tomorrow on the trail and I hope they will take this trash with them.
Today was only 7.1 miles.  That's 7.1 tough, rocky and on a rock ledge miles! With my past experience wandering off the trail I checked frequently for the white lines to be sure this was a trail. As I carefully placed each foot I thought I must have part billy goat in me only to laugh and hear my wife say I was more like a jackass. 
The number of hikers are dwindling. We had a steady average of about 40 people to start and are now down to about 18-20 people.   
I did catch back up with Al, Parker and K-bar the firestarter at camp. There are also two young Swiss ladies here tonight. Ironically I made dinner and also had a block if Swiss cheese which I did offer to them. They said, ""Yahhh.""
It is not raining tonight so I made a laundry line and hung my tent and other stuff to dry. I will camp in the shelter tonight.","Low Gap

OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627042,"got to dicks gap yesterday after spending a awesome night at deep gap shelter . I met southpaw who has thru hiked the trail twice and has a great base knowledge of hiking and shares his stories of past hiking experiences. We are Sharing a room at the budget motel in Hiawassie. I went and resupplied and did laundry while trying to charge my electronics.
I checked my weight on a scale in the motel office and I went from 222 to 212 . My legs have been sore but each day seems to be a little better. I find it’s easier to go up hill then down on my joints . The cardio is improving but I’m still slow . I always try to refill my smart water bottles when I get down to 1/2 full. It’s funny about my thirst because while drinking the cold spring water it taste like a sweet water and I feel satisfied with enough energy to keep going. 
We’re catching the 11:00 am shuttle to dicks gap and will hike to plum orchard gap shelter for the night . Take care","Deep Gap Shelter

OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627060,"After the nice shower and good nights rest at Budget Motel I rushed to catch the shuttle to Dicks Gap. I was a hot mess trying to get myself together and fight the rain (again) to get out of that van! Was happy to start off with some trail magic where a kind lady was making egg, bacon and toast sandwiches. That turned my day around. As I said good bye to Georgia and crossed into North Carolina I have to say I don't wish to see Georgia again.  The people were great and so kind, the mountains and ALL THAT RAIN was horrible.  Today was the best view I have had since I started. The view is breath taking as I head toward the Smokey Mountains in the future. The attached picture is of the purest, sweetest water I had ever tasted. 
My pack is a little heavy because I stocked up on food in town but I am warm, happy and ready to forge on. 
Talk to you soon,","Dicks Gap
",Muskrat Shelter,"Mar 17, Tue",11.80
OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627100,"Got a good start this morning on the trail leaving Muskrat Shelter with no rain, yeah! By 1-2:00 the rain started in and didn't stop all day. As I drudged on I finally stopped at the top of a very large mountain at 5000 feet in what seemed to be the continued foggy atmosphere of days pass. I looked around and to my amazement I was so high up I was in the clouds. How surreal to be up there. I enjoyed the water and rested in the rain until the air became cold enough I had to keep moving.  By 5:00 I had made it to Carter Gap. I made a pot of jambalaya and filled my belly full. Full belly, warm sack and now dry in my tent, I am heading to bed. 
Oh and cornavirus precautions? Everyone elbow bumps instead of hand shakes and self isolated in my tent with good hand washing. Stay safe everyone.","Muskrat Shelter

OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627147,"Wet night but good spirits this morning with birds singing me my favorite songs and a nice looking day coming along. With a hot cup of coffee !
I'm leaving Carter gap and heading to Rock gap shelter which is mile 105.6 . That's 12.8 miles . I need to hang my stuff tonight to dry it out . Parker , the English lad set his tent up near me because I avoid the dead trees that can fall in high winds . I noticed a lot of burnt trees along the way yesterday as past forest fires were here . Later I heard they do control burns out here too.
 I heard two different grouse drumming yesterday.
Trash duty is still a priority. One of the biggest things I see left out here on the ground are those plastic flossing things. Why people don't pick up after themselves I do not know.(My wife willbe peoud of me picking up things after myself AND others!  I even found a cell phone. A few miles later I found ""Thornbush"" a fellow hiker who was very happy I found his phone. 
Be sure to check out my photos for some awesome views.","Carter Gap
",Rock Gap,"Mar 19, Thu",12.10
OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627210,"The morning started out dry and I was ready to head out. Got a good start and about 11 am the rain started and by noon I was wet, cold and exhausted. These mountains are tough.  I decided to get into the next shelter (Siler) and get dried out. I hung my stuff to dry and had 3 others join me in the afternoon, ""Tree"" is hiking with her dentist, Bruce aling with Holly from Maine. Small talk, dry shelter and a good night sleep was in order for all of us.
The next morning it quit raining.  I was heavy on my food supply and Holly had been eating cold meals for the past 2 weeks.  I made a big batch of oatmeal with granola in it and shared it with the group. 
Bruce was having issues with his pole collapsing and I had some duct tape in my pack. I was able to fix his poles and we all got on our way.
Some of the ""kids"" had to leave to go home with thr pandemic. ""Can man"" was from the Netherlands. He had a full can of fuel and offered it up to me before he departed.  I've met some great people on the trail.

",Aquone Cabins Hostel,"Mar 21, Sat",6
OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627230,"I started the day off well rested and ready to go. It was only because I had the best night rest, dry gear and clean laundry!  I feel bad for the fellow hiker Ann (can't remember her trail name) who fell off the trail and sprained her ankle. The German lad helped her up and I had an ace wrap in my pack so we wrapped her up and helped her along the trail. We asked where she was heading and she told us of this hostel.  When I got there I asked if they had an extra room and they did. Aquone Cabins is such a cozy and relaxing place. The people were great!  All our gear was out on the porch and nothing was allowed inside with the worry of coronavirus. We also had to wipe and disinfect all of our electronics and they disposed if the garbage I had collected up!  With pancakes topped with bananas and 5 cups of the best coffee I've had in days I hit  the trail early.
So facing your fears. Two things I am not fond of is heights and snakes and I encountered and tolerated both today.  I climbed a firetower to the top with ease and not even a jitter. My wife asked how I got to the top of a firetower when I can't climb a ladder. I'm pretty sure it's these trails! At points today the trail was as wide as my shoulders with straight down both sides of me. Ine wrong move or slip and your gone! I couldn't turn around so no place to go but straight ahead. Then I found myself heading down the trail and it was so steep and rocky I had to slide down on my butt. (The Duluth trading pants I have are REALLY holding up to this trail, top notch). No man would build a trail this narrow, they have to be the original made by the Native American Indians. This trail is NOT for the faint at heart!
Now...about that snake. I really didn't think I would see snakes this early. I guess that's what thinking did for me! He didn't look poisonous, you know like an alligator looking head on it ( my perspective) so I moved on, quickly! I will say I could feel the Tri-County guys lurking around a tree laughing at me with this snake. Matter of fact they probably paid someone to plave them all the way to Katahdin!  By the way guys- these Trekking poles are awesome! 
Trekking on!","Aquone Cabins Hostel

OldChief,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627263,"Awoke this morning to the heavy down pour of rain and lightening. (The lightening seems a little closer way up here ?). I decided it would be a good zero day to hunker down and stay put.  By mid morning the rain let up and subsided where my comrades and I decided to hike while the sky was dry. Soon we were at the Nantahala Outdoor Center in Wesser, NC. The center was closed as was most of the town. The outpost storewas open with limited supplies. They let us charge our phones and electronic devices. One of my fellow hikers had been fighting a leak in his tent.  He had called the company to tell them and you will not believe it!  The owner drove up here in his Mercedes Benz and replaced his tent! You know why?  It was MADE IN AMERICA! Now THAT is customer service!  The name of the company is ""Lightheart""  https://lightheartgear.com/  near Ashboro, NC and his wife hiked the AT a few years back and was carring a 4 1/2 lb tent and decided there needs to be a lighter tent. SHE understands the need for reliable equipment. I was so impressed!
I had a place to weigh my pack and it was at 37#, ugh! I was able to lighten it to 32# by getting rid of things I don't use and my food is getting low which lightens the load and this is a good thing because the hill ahead is a monster. I'm heading to Sassafras Gap Shelter and it is now 3:30 pm as I start out.  Most of these fellow hikers are marathon runners and skinny little, athletic people.  ""Hops"" is one lad who geta his name from working at a brewery. They remond me, in stature, of Zeke and Jake Drake back home.  I'm just a 56 year old short pile of frump trying to keep up. Well watch out kids, Old Chief is getting his trail legs under him and I feel a lot stronger! I hiked from 3:30-8:00 pm and arrived up at Sassafras Gap drenched in sweat at about 5000 feet.  One thing I saw out here on the trail, at the top of this huge mountain is the plaque I attached in the picture. William Sutton died near here in a forest fire in 1968-69. It just hit me ALL the sacrifices people have made so I can enjoy this adventure of a life time.  Another thing fellow hikers and I have noticed is your dreams are different out here. I can't explain it yet but your whole life is different.
I am at 5000 feet and tomorrow's hike is UP the mountain so I better get to bed.
