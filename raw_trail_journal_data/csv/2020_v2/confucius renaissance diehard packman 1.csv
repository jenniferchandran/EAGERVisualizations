confucius renaissance diehard packman 1,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628746,"stardate late entry, but better then never.  bare with me.  i just set up another journal for my next hike starting with mostly what happened from this hike a month ago.  it seems i've inadvertently modeled a quentin tarantino narrative here. endings in beginnings, vice versa.  u get it.  though the man is a genius of our era in film which is a conversation for another day.  and i'm a gen... never mind.  it has not been my intention to do so. im still familiarizing myself with at journal. i just found to be truly vein and to see your journal public u need three entries.  i guess. still don't know but we will see.  because like the little pigs and the mice this is three. so wee wee wee to see.  why three i think because artistically it works.  u should never arrange with even numbers so five might be to much.  i think in this journal i may incorporate past im thru with hiking memories. it should be thru hike. i left it at i was to tired i would write the next day and i didnt. sorry i just took off.  i didnt have everything together to leave that fine sunny warmish saturday morning.  after adjusting the last min did i get everything i know im going to remember when im out there it. it became 11:00 am.  and had to dee dee.  i ride a v star 1100 which is bobbed and can not ride farther then an hour without my ass becoming angry enough that given free license to kill would purge society as a whole. a blow up donut is the shrink required to modify its its insane tendencies. guess what it was the first thing to make sure i did not forget.  dont judge.  i usually ride without it so its not my go to habit daily.  telling u i dont make long trips that often. so it was exciting. you know. yea yea as it gets chillier heading into the hills riding side saddle on one cheek then the other.  squirming as though there sugar water undies with a zoo of insects on the loose like the jumanji release scene. reality starts setting in. thems the hills and there rocky painful to more then just an ass.  weeks in unknown situations. weather considerations. HOLY CRAP NO PUN INTENDED I THINK...D   DO I HAVE ENOUGH TOILET PAPER.  number 2 wipes have to stop.  all this because it looks like paradise up ahead by the comparison of sitting another minute on this motorcycle owwwww. 75 mph over hill and dale is not fast enough to get to had i known to be what it was to be.  that should have been and not at the same time. i might have turned around to endure another hour and  half of ironing my butt the hard way.  but the smells the open air. small towns.  the clock turns slower the longer u stay out.  at 75 mph a hummingbirds wings move at the speed of a baby's first step.  its work with a good result.  U HOPE u never know that is the why.  or are u the type that its what u make it.  half full not half empty.  optimist or pessimist is it the same am i the same will i bee when im done.  if a challenge will i rise or fall.  if living in the moment is the moment enough. always is it the journey or the destination. all hope desire passion ambition or the couch.  there are  no adventures on the couch. unless your a writer im sure u could conjure one up but. u know where the water is there. where your going to sleep what you'll eat and do for the day.  leaning into the turns along the river between pa and new jersey sewing my way to the spearhead.  the first night sleeping outside is a wonder.  how much is to little or to much to accomplish it is a question to many im sure. ive found its not for everyone. night and day one to come.  perhaps the best part of being able and off the couch and the reason u should most is because u can. so many can not and wish. we can help them thru there wish and share a not only written but accomplished journey thru time. or it could just be a hike.  naaaaa but u decide.  bring on the weirdos",,View Entry,"Jun 22, Mon",0
