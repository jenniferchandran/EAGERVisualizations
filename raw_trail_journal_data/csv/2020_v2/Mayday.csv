Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624576,"Just realized that I am starting to feel like time is flying by as I am preparing for my AT hike to start in March.  My sister may do a few days with me and my daughter is hoping to hike a week at the start. So, I now have most of my gear and I’m working out at Anytime Fitness a few times a week with my trainer Curtis. I’m starting to rediscover the athlete within and although it hurts sometimes...mostly it feels great to have some muscles again. Now I just need to learn how to use all the stuff I bought-but really I’m starting to feel better about my chances on this whole challenge. I will start hiking in March and I hope the trail gods will let me have a long run on it.",,View Entry,"Oct 31, Thu",0
Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625874,"Hi Everyone!It’s been a long time since I’ve posted but I’m preparing to launch my hike around the end of March.I’ve been working out with my trainer, Curtis, at Anytime Fitness gym for the last 9 months and I feel like he’s done a good job helping me get back some muscle and balance. I decided to pull out all my camp gear today and start weeding out items. Found myself on the living room floor all snug inside my sleeping bag. I could have napped awhile but forced myself to practice fitting the bag and sleep pad back into the tiny covers. Had a little trouble...figured it out. Tomorrow I will practice the tent set-up a few times.  Will start practice hiking with the full pack next month. Pretty excited to meet some of you on the trail soon. ~Mayday",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Mon",0
Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625895,"Hi All,At the grocery store today I started noting the items that I could take in my backpack. (There are a lot of mashed potato flavors)! I bought some items to try. I hadn’t really thought about food until today. I’ve spent years studying what gear I will need. I think food will be easier.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Tue",0
Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626386,"I can only hope the AT trail isn’t as muddy as the ones here in Ohio right now. I’ve been wearing several different pairs of shoes hiking this week because they get so caked in mud. I guess I’m going to have to break down and clean them before I go out again. I don’t want them in the house or my car until I knock off a layer of muck. I’ve been thinking about those first trail steps coming up next month with a little trepidation. I’ve had some dreams (nightmares!) about the hike...fortunately, they have gone away and I feel like I am over some emotionall hump. Do other people have these thoughts? I figure I’m pretty normal so I’m assuming everybody else has these doubts, too. (and if I’m the only one feeling this way-don’t tell me!) Haha. I’m feeling right on schedule for it all to come together next month so that’s where I’m leaving it tonight. (Panic to follow...)",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Mon",0
