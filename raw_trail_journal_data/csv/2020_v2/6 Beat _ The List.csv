6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623400,"Mike (my husband) and I (Janet) have been planning this journey for several years.  We've recently sold our house, purchased a new travel trailer and truck, and when we retire in a couple months, we're ready to begin the first of many new adventures.  Mike has loved hiking and backpacking since he was a kid, and has always wanted to attempt a long hike such as this.  We are both avid hikers and backpackers and found it's something we really enjoy together.  We've both read a lot of books regarding various trails and decided if Mike was going to attempt a thru hike, the Appalachian Trail would be the one we would equally enjoy.  I'm going to follow along with our RV and am looking forward to supporting his dream, being a trail angel, and doing some day hikes of my own (I had no desire to hike that many miles)!  We hope to see you on the trail!",,View Entry,"Sep 24, Tue",0
6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623401,"Mike served in the military for 20 years, then went on to become a police officer.  During most of his time as an officer, he patrolled a certain section of our city called a beat.  His beat was 6 beat.  When we were discussing his trail name, he told me he was ready to retire and move on, but needed to do some decompressing on the trail and some reflecting about his career.  Since 6 beat has been so much of his identity for the last 25 years, he felt it was an appropriate trail name.  He also decided since I would be supporting his hike and spending a lot of my time as a trail angel, I needed a name as well.  He named me ""The List"", which is very appropriate as I'm very detail oriented and make lists for absolutely everything.",,View Entry,"Sep 24, Tue",0
6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624191,"We are on our last camping trip of the year and our last trip as part time RV'ers.  The next time we'll stay in our RV will be on the way to Georgia!  We have our reservation at Amicalola Falls State Park beginning on March 12th, and from there I'll begin to scope out campgrounds to the north as Mike (6 beat) makes his way up the trail.  We are both so excited for our journeys to begin.  I will be updating Mike's hike on here and will let people know where I'm going to be for trail magic and rides into town.  Janet (The list)",,View Entry,"Oct 15, Tue",0
6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626514,"We have 12 days before we arrive at Amicalola Falls State Park, and 2 weeks from tomorrow ""6 Beat"" will begin his hike.  We are both so excited and can't wait to meet you all on the trail :)",,View Entry,"Feb 29, Sat",0
6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626930,"It's been a challenging few days traveling here and then actually getting our large camper up the hill to the campground at Amicalola Falls State Park, but we made it!  6 Beat started his journey this morning on the approach trail, and I will pick him up at the end of the day at the top of Springer Mountain.  It's also our wedding Anniversary today so we will get to celebrate that tonight.  We will be camped here for the next 9 days so I'll be able to pick him up whenever he'd like a hearty meal or a comfortable bed to sleep on.  We are both so excited that our years of planning are finally in motion!","Amicalola Falls Campground

6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627126,"6 Beat had a long day, too long for not being used to hiking up and down mountains!  He felt good at Hawk Mountain and decided to keep going to Justus Creek, which wasn't the best choice.  He made it there in the pouring rain, set up his tent, crawled in, and as soon as he was changed and in his sleeping bag he fell asleep.  I had an even longer day and night because he forgot to text me on his Inreach when he got settled to tell me he made it to camp.  I didnt sleep well and the next morning started reaching out to others to see if they knew where he was.  Of course, he called me late morning the next day and he was fine but tired.","Springer Mountain

6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627139,"6 Beat was going to spend a 2nd night on the trail but the miles he'd hiked the day before along with being soaking wet from 2 days of rain made him change his mind.  We decided it would be best to pick him up at Woody Gap.  I arrived early with trail magic consisting of water, beer, Coke, bananas, apples, chips, and cookies for the other hikers to enjoy.  I met a lot of great people including Panama, Wolf, Arch, Littlefeet, and some others who either didnt have trail names yet or sorry, I forgot your names!  We had good conversations while I waited for 6 beat to arrive. It was decided my trail name was going to be changed to Hats, so now that is how I'm known by the bubble of hikers around us.  I think I like that name better anyway!  When Mike arrived he was exhausted and the next day, he wasn't feeling good so he took the day off.  He felt better by the end of the day.","Justus Creek

6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627140,The sun was shining today and the weather was warm!!  It lifted both our spirits immensely.  I dropped 6 Beat off at Woody Gap and saw some young girls handing out trail magic.  I had brought some blueberry muffins with me and asked if they would hand them out with their other treats.  The hikers were definitely enjoying the treats they had brought!  I barely made it back to the camper when I got a call from 6 Beat saying he was almost halfway to Jarrard Gap already.  He contemplated moving on to Neel Gap until I reminded him he would have to climb Blood Mountain and it would make for a long day since he got a late start.  He agreed and I picked him up at Jarrard Gap.  Tomorrow is a hard climb for him and the weather doesn't look like it will be nearly as nice....,"Woody Gap

6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627549,"6 Beat had an easy day today and went from Jarrard Gap to Neel Gap.  While at Neel Gap, he met a young hiker from Australia who was trying to figure out if she should stay on the trail.  She was debating on the name Dingo or Aussie Girl.  She called her father while I was there picking up 6 Beat and he told her she should stay on the trail instead of trying to get back home.  We checked out the store and bought a few things.  I, of course, got a new hat!","Jarrard Gap

6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627550,"6 Beat took the 22nd and 23rd off to help move our camper from Amicalola Falls to the KOA in Murphy, North Carolina.  We did a big grocery shopping at Walmart, which is only 2 miles away from the campground.  The KOA is very nice and in a very pretty area!  He had an easy hike and I picked him up and brought him back to the camper for a hearty meal.","Neel Gap

6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627551,"6 Beat had a long hike today with some good climbs.  He was late getting to Unicoi Gap and I was worried about him until I saw a thru hiker coming across the street who told me he had seen him but he was still farther away.  The hiker I spoke with was a veteran who had several others who had been hiking with him in addition to a support crew; however, they had all decided to leave and go back home.  He told me the trail was helping him heal and I felt bad that all his friends had left!  I also met a young man named Will, and Connie and her husband who were traveling in their motorhome and hiking along the way.  6 Beat finally got to Unicoi before dark and I was very happy to see him!","Tesnatee Gap

6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627554,"It was pouring down rain when we got up, so 6 Beat took the day off.  It poured all day nonstop.  I drove to Unicoi to see if anyone needed a ride and found ""Sarge"" there waiting for a shuttle to Gainesville GA to take him home.  I gave him a banana and let him warm up in my truck while waiting for his shuttle.  While we were there a guy pulled up in his truck to see if anyone needed a ride.  He had thru hiked in 2019 and was trying to so some magic for others.","Unicoi Gap

6 Beat & The List,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627557,"6 Beat left for a 2 day hike from Deep Gap to Winding Stair Gap.  The weather was clear but somewhat cool.  He told me the next morning that he was freezing cold overnight and barely slept.  He has only seen day hikers on the trail, no thru hikers recently.  I picked him up at Winding Stair Gap and he was thoroughly exhausted.  I saw a huge snake on the trail as I hiked toward him, scared me to death lol!","Deep Gap
