BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24893,"Well here goes nothing! I'm not real sure where to begin with this whole thing I have never kept a journal and I’ve purposely not read any of the other journals so I won't be influenced by them. Where to start? I think it was Mark Twain who once said, “I’ve always found, the best place to start is at the beginning.” Last month held for me one of those most hated of birthdays. For some folks the worst is 30 for others 50, for me it fell right in the middle: 40. I was already having a less than easy time with the whole turning 40 thing when the most unbelievable thing happened: the day before my birthday I picked up an item at work, took a step and gave myself a Bi-lateral hernia! Now how's that for a happy birthday present? All my life I have been what is termed as very athletic, this injury was physical to be sure; but it also came as a huge blow to my psyche. I had never before had to face the reality of not being able to do something due to physical condition. Couple this with the birthday problem and one begins to re-think where he is at with life. After the surgery was done and I was back on the mend… wait, before I go any further I need to say this, “Men, when they tell you that hernia surgery is no big deal, it's routine, “and my favorite, “you'll have some discomfort, “they are telling the truth! Sort of. That’s exactly how you will feel when you go home, and for the next 4 to 8 hours. It's the next 4 to seven days that are pure Hell. Lets just say that during this time I had plenty of time to think about where I was going in my life, where I had been and what was important. My wife and I had already begun planning to do the trail in sections starting with this Summer. I was working on the preparations for this trip when I had the accident. While rehabbing at home it came to me that I could through hike and they could join me for the last 400-500 miles during the summer. Did you catch the “while rehabbing Part” even while laid up in bed after major surgery I would not admit that the accident happened or that it would keep me down. When I made the suggestion, I was sure it would not go over very well. The one thing I forgot was that you women are psychic, my wife saw this one coming for more than a week. Well the decision was made and the fact I've got the support at home is wonderful.",,View Entry,"Sep 25, Wed",0
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24894,"Well the fun and games continue. I still have not been able to decide on a tent. Every time I think I've found the right one, I find another one that seems to fit the bill. Outside of this little problem everything is going pretty much as I planned. Who the Hell am I kidding? I've still got the food issue to get a handle on; supply drops have not even been approached yet; I still have most of the clothing to pick up; my wife officially thinks I'm nuts; and my doctor just about had a coronary when he found out what I'm planning. Yep going just as I planned.......",,View Entry,"Sep 28, Sat",0
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24895,"Well I finally got the issue with the tent resolved. I decided on the old 2.5-pound no-name relic I’ve had all along and I feel very comfortable with the choice. This does remind me of a point I was going to make in reference to equipment. I've been reading e-messages on several different AT trail sites and have been hearing a lot of people talk about new equipment and how you have to buy the best. I'm sure that there are those of you who will argue with me on this one, but I just don't think this is true. I have bought several of the items I'll be taking with me new, but that's only because the old ones were worn out and trying to find a used one was going to cost as much as new. I would like to point out that a great many of us don't have all the money in the world to spend on a trip like this and living within a budget is mandatory. If I can pass along one piece of advice I've learned, KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN! You would be surprised how many camping and backpacking gems I've picked up at garage sales, auctions and church bazaars. For the last 5 years I've been using a North Face internal frame that I bought at a garage sale for a buck! Pardon the expression, but this is the best damn backpack I have, hands down… and I have 4 brand new ones. When you see these types of bargains, snatch them up. Even if they don't fit you, you never know when the parts might come in handy. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN! I think a lot of what you need, will come very cheaply. By the way, this does not go for footwear, don't play with that one. Get the right shoes for your feet.",,View Entry,"Oct 05, Sat",0
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24896,"Well, I finally got some pictures uploaded. This was also a pretty big day when it comes to me going hiking this coming year. The doctor gave me the green light today to start with some light excersizes. This is really good news, as I need to start working out. I have a real bad habit of packing on the weight when I'm just sitting with nothing to do. He was more than happy to point out I'm a little heavier than I should be. I have also been asked this week by a professor at school if I would be interested in doing some electronic mapping while on the trail. I'll have to wait and see how that works out. Some of that equipment can get pretty weighty. I have to go for now, I am going to take my first long afternoon walk, this is going to feel good.",,View Entry,"Oct 12, Sat",0
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24897,"Oh my God does that feel good! Just got back from a five-mile walk after school. Just around the track, but just the same, to finally be able to exercise a little is really a boost to the old spirit. My wife and I are heading up to Enchanted Rock for the weekend, hope to have some really good pictures online early next week. Enchanted Rock is the biggest exposed batholith in Texas, not much of a climb (450' I think) but the views are outstanding. On the food front I made another batch of jerky last night. I've talked with several people who were really surprised at how I make it. So I'll post it here, this is really complicated so pay attention. Buy a dehydrator (again, no need to go crazy and buy the best. Ours cost about $50 and we've been wearing it out and it keeps on going.) Buy a jerky gun ($15 to $20) and 5 pounds of 10%lean hamburger; that’s right hamburger. Follow the directions and you’re all good. It takes no time at all. I start a load about 7pm and when we get up the next morning it's done. Just remember to use as lean a hamburger as you can get. It's the fat that makes it go rancid. I've been keeping a bag in the refrigerator just to see how long it will keep. I try some every week, 2 months and it's still good. We're getting pretty good with this thing so if you have any questions I'll be glad to help if I can. Thanks to everyone who's been signing the guest-book, I hope I'll be seeing a lot of you on the trail.",,View Entry,"Oct 15, Tue",5
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24898,"For those of you not living in Texas and who for some reason don’t follow current events,.. man we don't need anymore rain! My rain gauge measures up to 4 inches and I've emptied it twice in the last 4 days. I really feel for those in the San Antonio area. It wasn’t too long ago, 2 months maybe, that they were flooded; now it's happening again. One good thing though is that I'm getting plenty of wet weather hiking in; about 5 miles a day. I've been locating some problems with my equipment. One was, my so called ""rain cover"" for the pack has a nasty habit of collecting water in the bottom. A few holes in the underside took care of that. My Columbia rain jacket worked great, but the pants (from a different maker) are not worth a damn. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. Apparently the company and I have a different ideas of what waterproof means. If you have any ideas please e-mail me. Well needless to say we didn't get to go to Enchanted Rock over the weekend. The last place you want to hike during a thunderstorm is on a giant barren batholith. I may be slow, but not that slow. Spent some time in the new tent over the weekend just the same I set the tent up in the back pasture and stayed in it Friday and Saturday nights. I'm happy to report that the tent performed better than I could have hoped. Even with all this rain I woke up dry. Life is Good!",,View Entry,"Oct 22, Tue",5
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24899,"Well here it is another Sunday, and another week closer to the trail. A few thoughts if I could about something I realized this week. As you may or may not know, here in Texas we have had just about all the rain we can stand. I've had plenty of days where I could get out and test my equipment, and myself, in the elements. For the most part everything has held up pretty good with the equipment (I discussed in the last post a couple of problems); for myself, that’s a different story. I found myself on several different occasions saying, "" Oh to Hell with this, I'm going to the house."" Each time I fought through it, but it brings up a very good point. If you are even thinking about trying the trail, do not forget about the mental preparation! If you look at journals from people that have finished their hike, just about all contain some reference to the mental toughness it took to maintain: when one starts saying ""I don't ""HAVE"" to be here"". But how many of us who are starting the process are seriously taking into consideration, preparing mentally for the trip? Here comes the lesson I learned, find the nastiest weather you can and hike in it as often as possible. Camp in it if you can. If you’re going to be traveling alone on the trail, travel alone during your prep hikes. Don't let yourself quit, just because you’re only a few miles from the house. I've had 6 or 7 days straight of rain to work out in. Believe it or not as you get the gear right, and your mind right, it gets easier to deal with everyday. The more you find out about and prepare yourself and your gear now, the less likely they are to force you off the trail later. There endith today's lesson. Well that's just about going to do it for this Sunday morning. We are heading out to visit my folks for the afternoon and take the opportunity to inform them of my little jaunt. Somehow I don't think my ""old school"" Dad is going to be quite as understanding as my wife was. Thank god the voice of reason (Mom) will be on hand. It's kind of funny when I think about it, I'm 40 years old and still worry about being called on the carpet by Dad. Some things really never do change! Please take a minute and sign the guest-book. As one of my traveling companions on the trail so aptly put it, ""The trail is all about meeting new people and finding yourself.”",,View Entry,"Oct 25, Fri",5
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24900,"Well here it is another fright night! It's totally fitting too, because that’s the type of week I've had. Now one thing I swore I was not going to do was bash anybody on this or any other site I might be dealing with. That having been said I learned a very expensive lesson this week. No matter what the salesperson tells you (even if, as in this case they are the manager) read the fine print. My wife and I had been shopping for about 3 weeks for not one, but two cameras. One for me to take on the trip and the other camera for home use. We finally decided on the cameras and where we would get them based on several things. The biggest of which was that they had a program that when you brought the film in for developing, they replaced all film free for a year; no-limit. This was a very large deal as we are expecting to burn several hundred rolls of film. I had a long conversation with the manager and explained that I wanted all pictures on disc and had no use for prints. He assured me that this was no problem and they even did the discs in house. Enter now 2 weeks later (this week) we drop off film to be developed, when we came back to pick up the discs and our replacement film, we were quite shocked to learn we would be getting no free film. It seems that if you don't buy the entire package of processing (prints and disc) you don't get the film. I spoke at length with the salesperson in the store and she remembered when I had bought the cameras and the related conversation. Her assistant manager informed me that he would be speaking with the district manager in the morning and would get the problem worked out. I received a call today from a very apologetic salesperson that said the district manager (although also apologetic) basically said, I'm out of luck. What I was told, and as far as I'm concerned, was sold was not company policy. This little mistake of mine will cost us 600 to 800 dollars over the next year. I take the responsibility for the mistake, because in the end it falls to me to understand what it is I'm buying. Please learn from my mistake, read it all before you buy. Now on a much happier note, it looks like I'm finally going to get over to Enchanted Rock and not the usual way. Most of you know I'm a non-traditional student a Sam Houston State University. The Recreation Department has put together a mountain climbing trip to the rock. I never knew that the backside is almost a sheer 300-foot drop off. I'm also no mountain climber! That’s ok, I'm gonna learn. This should be worth a picture or two in the coming weeks. The trip is slated for the 15th, I'll get something on shortly after. AND NOW FOR THE BIG NEWS! The rain has finally stopped, the sun came out yesterday and scared the Hell out of everyone. Before it figures out it's not supposed to be here I'm going hiking. See you next week.",,View Entry,"Oct 31, Thu",5
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24901,"Man what a rush. Just got back from Enchanted Rock, and it was exquisite. Remember I said the sun had come out and scared everyone, it didn't stick around long. But this time I'm glad it didn't. When I first got to the park and set up camp it hadn't rained there in about 48 hours. Most of the small creeks coming off the rock had dried up (it doesn't take long). BUT, it started to rain just after dark, and by morning the whole place had come alive. I've uploaded several of the pictures I took, but I don't think they will do it justice. All I can say is this,” I've never been so happy hiking in the rain!” At one point while I was on the summit, my head was in the clouds but when I bent down the bottom of me wasn't. Really weird, but awesome. Hope you enjoy the pictures, they will be up for about 2 weeks. Well I learned a few things about myself and my equipment over the weekend. First is I don't sleep half bad when I'm wet. Slept like a baby even though the rain was pounding down all night. One problem though was that my bag might be a little too small. Either that or I'm a little to large. It kept binding on me every time I tried to move. This I didn't like since I tend to move around a lot when I sleep. I'm also going to try and go much lighter than I currently am. I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to accomplish this but I know it will mean some pretty big equipment changes. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the great folks who put together and maintain this site. They are having some difficulty with getting it all moved over to a new server and I understand that the need for some financial support is great. If there is anyway you can help these folks out please do. It would be a crying shame if this site were to no longer exist or was forced to become a pay-site. I know that I have found that the experience of others recorded here has been invaluable. Finally, we have now finalized the travel plans for the rest of this year. I will spend some time on the Lone Star Trail around Thanksgiving and at least a week in Big Bend over the Christmas break. As always please feel free to e-mail any questions, and please sign the guest book. Thank you for reading.",,View Entry,"Nov 04, Mon",5
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24902,"Howdy everybody! Well it took me a couple of extra days but I'm starting to get some response from the contacts I made on Friday. Looks like I might be able at the very least to get most of the electronics I need loaned to me for the trip. This is really a big deal for me as I'm starting to run out of money for equipment. I'm still making some decisions on the camping equipment though. One thing I do know is that I need to go much lighter than I am now. Saturday I spent the day walking the 8-mile loop around Sam Houston State Park. I carried the full pack including full fuel and water loads and 12 pounds of books to simulate food. Total weight: 41 pounds. Surprisingly I didn't have any problems. The pack felt fine, and I covered the distance in about 4 hours. Now you might ask why I'm worried about getting lighter if the weight was comfortable. Well I haven’t calculated the weight of the electronics yet, and that could be as much as 10 pounds! I also won't be able to plug into a tree and recharge, so that means a lot of batteries will be making the trip. I have already taken one set of clothes out of the equation. I will keep everybody posted on what the final outcome of the equipment is. You can rest assured that if they can't pull double duty, quite a few things will be staying home. I'm not nearly as anal about this as I could be though. When he signed my guest-book Anthony Weekly pointed out a great website: www.backpacking.net. This site has some great ideas for getting light, although in some instances I think they go too far. The whole sawing the handle off your toothbrush is a little too much. Before I close for tonight I would like to take the opportunity to thank a couple of people for all their help. Journey and Goldberry have been invaluable when it comes to the planning on this trip. Thank you to both of you for all your support and putting up with the bald man this coming March. As always please feel free to sign the guest-book, I always get the biggest kick out of what other people have to say. Thanks to everyone who has e-mailed their support, it really is most appreciated. Sometimes I start wondering if I'm doing the right thing.Until the next time, God Bless.John (Bearkat) FennessyPS: I feel like NASA, The countdown is on. 3 months 27 days, Or maybe less?",,View Entry,"Nov 10, Sun",5
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24903,"A funny thing happened today at school. I regained a long lost sense of what is important in life. While taking my daily walk around the quad: fall burst upon me with a vibrancy of color, imagery and sound that made me stop and wonder at the spectacle I have no memory of being so vivid. The cool wind spoke softly to the trees; who as if to signal their acceptance, let go with a rain of reds and yellows that fell lightly on the carpet of green. The students of a crowded college campus added to the effect, with smiles and laughter they walked amid the falling wooden snow. All, but a very select few were oblivious to the astonishing action and beauty surrounding them. The squirrels gathering food for the winter as they precariously dove from one tree to the next added to the majesty and in one sense the urgency of the season. As I took a seat and marveled at the sensations surrounding me I realized I could hear no sound. The visual explosion had become more than enough for me to enjoy the beauty that is nature. I have for so long been wrapped up in the need to, get here, do that, and what's next, that I never took the time to enjoy the magnificent visual beauty that nature imparts as a gift to us year round. Here's the real scary part, I'm happiest in the woods! No longer will I take for granted that which exists around me.",,View Entry,"Nov 16, Sat",5
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24910,"Well I'm back. I have not written in a couple of weeks because so much is happening and changing, and I wanted to wait for a break. I guess I should start with the big news. My start date for the trip has been moved up. I will be setting out on March 1 instead of March 15. The reason is two-fold. One reason is the need to take 3 weeks off the trail at the end of April, to speak at the university regarding the trip. This will also allow me to take my finals for the semester at Sam Houston, and not have to proxy elsewhere. I also have encountered a problem with certain publishing requirements, these too will need my attention during this period. After many hours of discussion, and in some cases out and out arguing within the group helping me plan the scientific portion of this trip, we have finally narrowed down the mapping objective. I will no longer be just making a map of the trail. We will be attempting to give those that will be planning future hikes, a useful tool in case of an emergency on their hike. More to come on this later, but it is my intention to make the final product available on-line at no charge. I would like to take the opportunity to thank ESRI Corp. They are the leading producers of mapping software, and today gave me a grant covering my software needs. If it wasn't for this company and several others that have faith in this endeavor, there would be no way that someone of my means could afford to make this happen. The second reason for the start date move is so I can be at home when the kids get out of school, and prepare their gear myself. I will then be there to travel with them back to the point of departure, instead of them trying to find me in the middle of someplace they have never been. You may have noticed that I have taken my gear list off the journal. This was done because over the last few weeks I have had plenty of opportunities to hike in all kinds of weather, and certain pieces just did not stand up. I have sent the Columbia rain jacket packing and now use a Red Ledge shell jacket and full zip Red Ledge rain pants. There have also been some changes due to the weather changes I will be hiking in. Instead of the lightweight boots I had planned on, I've gone to a Sorrel winter boot. The sleeping bag is the same but I've added a liner. I've dumped the self-inflating mattress and gone back to a foam pad. There have been many changes of equipment over the last few weeks and it will take a while for me to get them all on-line. I'm not terribly thrilled about setting out at this time of the year alone, hopefully there will be some other brave (and that may not be the right word) souls who will want to travel together. Well, as you can see much is in the offing. My wife and I both have finals this coming week then it is time to get very serious about the training for this little jaunt. To that end I think I'll stop here and head out for a little weekend getaway to clear the head and get in some study time. As we Irish say: Till we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of his hand.",,View Entry,"Dec 06, Fri",5
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24956,"Well it's finally over! I'm sitting here in the computer lab waiting for my wife who is finishing her last final. This will be special; she will finally be in a GOOD mood. This will also be cool because we won't have to hear her practice Spanish on everyone at home anymore (none of which speak Spanish by the way). For all I know she's been cussing me out this whole semester. This semester (by the way) seems to have gone on since before Christ was born. What makes it even worse is that I haven’t been able to focus on anything the last month and a half. Gee, I wonder why! I should feel pretty lucky about pulling out good grades right at the end! The important thing is that it's over. Now I can get serious about training for the trip forthcoming. Like up till now I've just been playing around. Well, I'll say this, “I need to start getting serious about working out.” I had been doing a good job of walking 5 plus miles a day up until about 3 weeks ago. I haven’t been doing much as we came in towards finals and I am paying for it now. To much butt time has meant to much gut time now. In just three weeks I've gained back all the weight I have lost since I started working out, and even added another 5 pounds. I can't help it I love food. My wife has pointed out on numerous occasions, the only reason she thinks I might not make it on this trip is the lack of a daily T-bone! You know I'll bet I could make like a rickshaw out of an ice chest and strap it to my waist? Ok, I'm just kidding. But I do need to start getting serious about my workouts or that whole Bigfoot thing is going to start up again.     Speaking of which, what do you think about the family of the man who started all that… admitting he made the whole thing up now that he's dead? Man I'll bet that made a bunch of people mad; some have spent their whole lives trying to find Bigfoot. Can you say, ""Boy don't I look stupid"". As far as I can tell there won't be anymore changes in the equipment I'll be carrying. The fact that the electronics weight will be negligible has made those decisions pretty easy. I have also decided on very few re-supply drops, probably no more than 8 to 10. Re-supplying for the most part along the trail just seems to me to be the far better way to go, unless I'm re-supplying high dollar items such as equipment or clothing.           I will close today with this thought. I have had yet another awakening in my life. Due to having to get up very early this past couple of weeks, my wife has made it a kind of game to send in our 8 year old son to wake me up. Oh the energy of youth at 6am. I of course am already awake but the game continues for as long as I can hold out being pummeled by kisses and hugs. All the time hearing over and over, Mommy says get up! The point I’m trying to make is: these are the little things I am going to miss the most. These by the way seem to be the same things most of us take for granted everyday of our lives. When was the last time you got into a huggy, kissy match with your kids? And don’t give me any of that garbage about them being too old. My mom still chases me around the kitchen table when we’re there, and I’ve got gray hair! That has to be the best thing about the entire trip so far, it has brought me back to understanding the importance of the small things in life.",,View Entry,"Dec 11, Wed",8
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/24964,"Well, it's morning of day one being done with school. Boy am I bored! No, I mean it. I'm so used to having to rush to class, get papers ready, take a test and meetings with professors over possible thesis ideas. Just sitting around the house all morning is driving me nuts. You would think I would be ready for a break with all that’s been going on, it's just not so.  I went over my gear list here online and it should be up-to-date now. I would like to ask those that have already hiked the trail a question, “Before you left, when all your gear was together and you knew it was what you needed and wanted, did you ever have the feeling that there was something critical that you had forgotten?” No matter how many times I've gone over it, double checked, repacked and so on, I just can't shake the feeling that I'm making a serious omission somewhere. I guess I just don't want to discover the omission when it's 10 degrees and snowing. As you can see from the picture, the Fennessy's went to see Santa this past weekend. Scotty wants anything Pokemon, Kristen anything Tommy-Girl, Frances Just wants a car that runs (her’s went back in the shop this week for a blown out main seal) and you know I don't think Santa does much camping?

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/25221,"Hello again from the house of Fennessy! Man what a great Christmas, I spent time with my parents, wife, kids and friends. For the first time in probably 3 months there was absolutely no pressure to be anywhere on time! I had forgotten how good it feels to just relax. Now that I have had a few days to regain my sense of direction, I think I'm going to do this more often. Next Thursday I begin my training for the trail. After several conversations with the doctor, I believe he has the schedule tailored to fit the unique stresses of the trail. I do know that it will contain 7 - 10 miles a day on the treadmill; an hour on the bike; light weightlifting everyday; water aerobics twice a week at the pool; and as he puts it, lots and lots of cardio. This is what I need, I kind of let myself go after the surgery. Here on the home front, the food is starting to pile up. We have been making jerky like we were going to feed the world. Then again with the early start I'm probably going to eat a lot more.   One thing I'm kind of surprised at is how cheap you can make the food you need. We have been buying in bulk at Sam’s and saving a lot of money. Here is a for instance: one big bag of Gardetto's Mix, one big bag of mustard pretzels, one big bag of M&M's and a 3 pound can of honey roasted peanuts; This made a 5 gallon bucket of trail mix for about 23 dollars.   I have decided to up my number of mail drops. I really did like the idea of re-supplying along the trail, but after many discussions with my wife, and weighing the costs, it turns out to be better for us to re-supply the basics from home.   What a weird feeling I had this morning by the way. I got up and came in here and started reading some journals. It was then that I realized some people are already beginning the trail for this year. More will start New Year’s day. Until today I had not realized how close we are to heading out. Just 6 weeks from now I'll be freezing on Springer and loving it. To put it in perspective, I started writing this journal 4+ months ago, 4 plus months from now I'll have been on the trail for more than 2 months.   In closing for today, I would like to wish everyone a happy and prosperous New Year. The countdown is truly on. For those getting set to hike the trail, 2003 promises to be a very special year in your life.May God bless you all in the coming year.",,View Entry,"Dec 28, Sat",8
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/25247,"Wow, another great day in trail preparation. I started checking with the places I will be using for my mail drops. What a great boost to find so many wonderful and enthusiastic people involved along the trail. I made half a dozen phone calls, and spoke with the most positive people I have ever had the pleasure of talking to. Not one of them had anything to say but positive encouragement, and the wealth of knowledge was beyond my greatest hope. You read about these places when your planning the trip, you might see pictures of them and you see them on the map. Wait until you meet the people that make these places real. Before today I was looking forward to making this trip because of the nature and opportunity for self-accomplishment. As of today I now see the most exciting part is the part I've left out: the people.    I continue to revise my gear. I have added a heavier pair of gloves, an extra pair of long underwear (Ironman Fleece) and will be changing sleeping bags in the near future. I will be going to a down bag. One reason for the continued move to heavier gear is the growing concern for a worse than average winter. I have spoken with many people, almost all believe this winter will be much wetter than usual. Most are concerned that it will be much colder as well, this having to do with El-Nino returning on the west coast.    I should have both the gear list and mail drops updated by the end of the week. The first person I know of started the trail yesterday, Bono. I would like to wish him the best of luck and a safe passage up the trail.God blesses you all.",,View Entry,"Dec 29, Sun",5

I woke this morning in a mood of reflection of all that led to the decision to hike in 2003: the injury mid-year, that led to surgery; the psychological wanderings of not feeling adequate any longer; and the incredible support of my wife and children. Frances, Kristen and Scott.The enthusiasms of my parents was not expected, but gave a huge lift to my spirits when received. Thank you Mom & Dad.The University (Sam Houston State University) was great by getting behind the endeavor in scheduling my classes and technical support. Thank you, Dr. Albert, Dr. Williams and Dr. Liepnick from the Geography/Geology department. Thank you, Dr. Bridges and Dr. Young from the English departmentThank you, ESRI for donating the software to help gather the data, and publish the data once I have gathered it. Thank you Dan Dignum, without you and ESRI I would not have been able to do this.Several of the professors at school have given me contacts that have proven to be invaluable. The Incredible people on several AT Groups that have leant their knowledge and assistance by making my learning curve as tight as possible. Every one of the people that have signed the guest-book, your words of encouragement have meant so much at times when I feel I can't make it happen.For the logistical support of my sister who lives in Georgia, “thank you so much Cynthia.”I'm sure there are at least a couple of people I missed.     When I look back it amazes me how much has gone into the entire process and how quickly we have gotten it accomplished. Now that s not to say that I am by any means done and ready to go. But we are a point that I can slow down a bit. The equipment is gathered (I still have a few things I would like to have, but if need be I can go with what I have). Mail drops have been planned and the checks have been made. Transportation has been arraigned, and funds set aside. Food continues to be gathered and prepared (but that process will continue all summer). Everyone tonight will celebrate the start of a new year. I wonder how many truly know what the coming year holds for them. How much more will we celebrate those that know what’s ahead; those that know that, years of desire will finally be full-filled in the coming year.    I have always looked forward, always forward.

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/25293,"Well, today started out perfect! What an absolutely gorgeous day in East Texas. When my wife and I rolled out this morning there was never any doubt about what we would be doing with our Saturday. Wake the kids get them dressed and head for Huntsville State Park and the 8 mile loop. It felt good to get back in the rhythm. We really have not done any solid miles since before the holidays. We seem to have faired fairly well though. We made the loop in 2 hours 45 minutes, and that’s stopping for a break at the 4-mile mark.     One thing that has turned out to be very exciting in the family is the absolute love our 8 year-old (Scotty) seems to have for the outdoors. He did the eight-mile loop with us, and I almost had to tie him up to keep him from starting the loop again. This will make things a whole lot easier when the family joins me in June. The 14 year-old (Kristen) is likely to be a mileage chewer when she hits the trail as well. She set the pace today, and I'm here to tell you she gave the old folks a workout. It's almost too bad that she can't join me for the whole trail. With her setting the pace it would be a quick trip up the hill.    I have been stripping my gear like a madman since we got home today! That's probably the most important thing I learned today, the pack was to heavy. I should have a new and complete gear list by Monday. I have taken my 5-pound synth bag and kicked it to the curb. I ordered a new +20 down bag, 2.4 pounds, a big difference. The Whisperlite stove and bottle: out. Esbit pocket stove and fuel pellets: in, The weight savings is over 2 pounds when you count fuel. I have said it before, but now I'm starting to understand the importance of the statement, “If it doesn't pull double duty it stays home.”    Well Greenbay and Atlanta are about to get it on, so I'll close for now. I have another 8-mile day planned for tomorrow after church, and then Monday I start the daily workouts with a trainer. Oh my gosh!

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/25388,"Howdy from the easy chair in my living room. You see, I started my workouts with the trainer today at 8am sharp. By 6pm sharp I was sitting in this chair and I have no intentions of moving. If the house catches fire, well that’s just too bad, I'm not getting up! If somebody breaks in, as long as they don't require me to move, I'll tell them where the money is and the combination. Who would have ever guessed a 5'4"", 20 something young lady could be so evil!!!!!         Ok, that's enough whining from the LazyBoy. The truth is I think this young lady is going to quite possibly be the reason I finish this trek. I walked in there this morning crowing like a cock at sunup. I left with the realization that I have a long way to go. The fact that I've been walking 5 miles a day may have helped me some, but when I got on the treadmill with a serious elevation, my calves told a different story. We started out with stretches, after she quit laughing (listen half the time I can't see my toes much less touch them) she set me straight on a few things. For instance bending over to get another cup of coffee doesn't count as a stretch. Who knew? I say all this in jest, but with a serious point: I do a couple of little stretches here and there before taking of on my hikes, I now understand I have not been doing nearly enough. We worked for a good deal of time on my hamstrings and calves, amazingly enough I had no knee problems today. After a quick 3 miles on the treadmill, we jumped over to the bike for another 10 miles. Did I mention before that they said there would be a lot of cardio? Well there is and I'm willing to bet this girl has a best seller on it in print somewhere. Between the morning break and lunch we went over the weight program she had set up for me. Not much weight, but lots of reps. After lunch I returned to find that sadistic little grin on her face. Yep, 30 seconds later I was treading along for another 3 miles. Another hour of lite lifting and it was time to go home.          I know that not everyone has the opportunity to do this. What I'm doing is a bit extreme and I know that. But everyone can find some time to do some simple exercises that will help you stay in shape. Take a walk, Isometrics in the office for 15 minutes, sit-ups before bed or when you get up are all ways to help keep it off. If you’re planning to walk the trail, this takes on a whole new importance. I thought I was ready. Sure I have a gut, but I can strap on the pack right now and go 10 miles: I did it over the weekend. Laticia showed me today that I'm not ready for anything but this big fat LazyBoy! But somehow I don't think she's going to leave it that way! That's why I'll get up tomorrow and do it again.",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Mon",6

I got there and little Laticia, aka The Evil Workout Queen, was in a really good mood In other words she left me alone and found somebody new to torture. Actually it's already getting a little easier everyday. I'm still waking up feeling like somebody broke in with the sole purpose of beating on my quads, but outside of that I'm holding up better than I thought I would after day one.         Hey, here's a news flash: if your one of those people that starts laughing when you see the old ladies in the pool doing water aerobics, I would like whoever is standing next to you to smack you on top of your head! You have no idea what you are laughing at. I have to do this funny little task every Tuesday and Thursday. When I got out of the pool yesterday, I just knew the coroner would be waiting outside to take me to my new residence. It may look funny, but that's the hardest aerobics I have ever done. You know what, Those older ladies are the funniest people I have ever met. They would never admit it, but they can tell some pretty good jokes, dirty ones too.         A final thought for this evening, I see that Bono has started getting his journal online after his December start. I was really surprised how reading his journal so far has affected me. I have spent so much time planning and networking to get ready, planning as much as possible so there are no surprises, that I forgot about spontaneity. One of the true pleasures of the trail is the ability to stop and just say, ""Not today."" You know I might just learn to stop and smell the roses, it could happen.",,Oh My God it Hurts so good!,"Jan 08, Wed",10
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/25589,"Woo Hoo! what a great day! Finally got a chance to go down to Houston and bounce around the suppliers a bit. Hit REI last and spent most of the afternoon testing gear and talking trails with some great people. Turns out that the General Manager, Chris Clements, used to work up at Neels Gap, and is a Wilderness EMT. When he found out where I was headed the chatter was on and you didn't want to get caught in between. We talked tents, we talked bags, we talked stoves, the last being a good thing since I went down there to buy an Esbit. He talked me right out of that. Seems I've had the right stove all along, the MSR Whisperlite. After about an hour of telling stories, he had to go to work and I spent some quality time in the sleeping department. Mike was working there and all I have to say is, “Bless his patient spirit."" After another hour of waffling (hey I should run for Office) would you believe I ended up with the same bag I picked out 6 months ago? I couldn't bring myself to buy the bag at the time over the Internet, but I found it here and at a better price: a North Face ""Cats Meow"". Well let’s see what else is going on? School starts tomorrow, it should be fun going up to the department for one whole day. After tomorrow everything for me this semester is on-line. We are starting the electronics process, time to find the right handheld computer/GPS combo for the job at hand. Right now the only clear PDA choice is the Compaq Ipaq. I’m Probably going to order one here in the next hour or so. It's the GPS unit that is giving me fits. I’m sure it will all get worked out very soon, one way or another. I have continued to look at the weight issue in regard to my gear. After going over everything I’m willing to part with and learning ways to make some gear do double duty (Even if it was not designed too) I have got my weight down to 23.5 pounds. That does include water and fuel but does not include food or electronics. The huge majority of the weight at this point is the winter cloths, there is not much I can do about that. I am continuing to update the gear-list. I hope everybody is having a great start of his or her New Year, and thank you for all the positive feedback.

Travel arraignments have been made, check-bought train ticket today. First several re-supply boxes are labeled and my bump box is set to go, check. I've tested all the equipment to make sure it works, check. I've got all the maps and data books i need cut up and in the right boxes, check. Taken care of everything at school that needs attention, check. Pack has been packed and repacked to double check load and fit, check. Contacted most of the early stops for special instructions, check. A special bank account has been set up for the trek, check.     WooooHoooo, I think I've just about got this whole thing handled. A good thing to, my wife has just about had it with the waffling on equipment, start dates, transportation and so on. I had wanted to put the equipment situation to bed by this weekend and have done exactly that. Probably the first time I've ever done anything on time, no kidding I was late getting to the hospital the day I was supposed to have surgery.    One thing that has changed though is the total pack weight without food. I had added all the weights up, but kept getting a much different weight when I weighed the pack loaded. Today I bought a new 2-pound kitchen scale and reweighed everything. Now the truth comes out. When a manufacturer says something weighs this much, don't you believe it. Not a single item weighed what it was supposed to. The new total is considerably higher at 29.43 pounds. One thing to keep in mind though, I weighed all my gear into the total, this includes the cloths I will have to be wearing. If you factor in a normal cold weather day, the weight drops to around 26 pounds. Figuring in five days of food and I'll come in around 35+ pounds, and that I'm good with.    Well we have a great week of weather headed our way here in east Texas.

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/25735,"When I started this journal, it was simply to keep a record of the events and nothing more. It has however turned into much more than just a chronological diary keeping. I have been able to learn more about myself every time I pick up the pen, so to speak. I have also been able to reveal more of my inner self, something that up until now was a very private domain. I have tried very hard to hold nothing back, if it affects me and the way I approach this trip, it,s in the journal. I'm not sure that the following is appropriate for this journal, but it is something that happened last night and has had a profound effect on the way I see things. If you are a bit squeamish; it's OK, this story has a happy ending. It should be said here that for years I have been and will continue to be a volunteer fireman here in the state of Texas. I have seen my fair share of accidents, house fires, brush and grass fires. I have also seen my share of fatalities. Last night I witnessed both the most violently scary and most incredibly rewarding moments of my life.1:01am - The sheriff s office toned out the department to a rollover accident with the vehicle on fire.1:10am - Following closely behind the fire truck I arrived on the scene of the worse accident I have seen in years. A one ton crew cab had left the highway at what some witnesses put at over 100 miles an hour. The frame had been cut nearly in half (by the many trees it had hit as it left the road) and was lying upside down fully engulfed in fire. The cab had detached itself from the frame and ended up right side up between the bed and the fence; it also was fully engaged.1:11am - We attacked the bed first as there was no clear access to the cab until the flames had been knocked down and a hole made. It was now that the fuel cell exploded. Thankfully no one was injured but it made the problem much worse. This entire time people were searching the field across the fence in the dark hoping to find the driver, hoping he was not inside this inferno.1:13am - We finally got the flames knocked down to permit access to the cab. Flames were now coming out the front windows and going 10 to 15 feet in the air.This truck had now been on fire for over 20 minutes. I attacked the front windows while another fireman smashed out the back window and attacked from there. We had the fire out in under a minute. But even with our fire gear on, the heat was enormous. I had to back away once because I was being burned.You can imagine what was going through my head; they had not found anybody on the ground or in the field, which left only one place. The other fireman with me (one of the best friends I have) Grabbed a flashlight and started looking for what we all knew was still in the truck: The Driver. It was a foregone conclusion that nobone could have ever survived that accident and fire: so how is it possible that lying on the floorboard, in the back seat was a living breathing human being. I will not bore you with everything from here on; let s just say I'm still in a state of Shock and Awe at what I have seen. I spent the rest of the night holding my wife while she slept. I am so very thankful for the wonderful life that God has given me. Thankful that miracles really do exist and happen; I know, I just saw one. One more thing I discovered about life in general. I know you have heard it before; DON'T EVER GIVE UP. I don't care how hopeless the situation looks, if you don't give up you never know what the reward might be. As for myself, I will always have a vivid reminder of how bad it CAN get.

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/25802,"Well Ok then; I woke this morning feeling my old self again. I took the day with my wife and shopped for the food I would need. We had a ball shopping together and I just love the looks you get when you buy 40 plus boxes of little Debbie cakes and two Soda's. The checker never said a word, but she didn't have to. I also need to be careful what I ask for. When we got up this morning it was 55 degree’s headed for a high of 70. I made a comment to Frances that this kind of weather is going to make it hard to acclimate during the first few days on the trail. It's now 7:30pm and 48 degrees headed for 27, tomorrow night it will be down to 19. That should go a long way towards helping me out. That's not the problem, the problem lays in that my wife hates the cold and she's blaming this on my big mouth. She was all talking tough saying she should make me sleep outside, all I could say was, COOL!All right, we have now moved passed the weather issue and I once again will get to sleep in my bed. In trail prep news I have decided after long thought to use a rather large bump box. It will hold: film, batteries, audio tapes and a whole host of other items. I would just feel better if I was able to have at my disposal all the equipment I MIGHT need. There are some restrictions to this plan though. Some places restrict parcels to 10 pounds. I completely understand and respect this, I have no problems with it. If I were receiving thousands of parcels every year for other people I might have to put on a limit too. I will also include two sets of good going to town cloths along with the sponsorship jacket for those official stops I have to make. You might have been wondering what ever has become of the “Evil workout woman.” Well after two weeks of everyday for eight hours, it hit me I could do this on my own, so I am. Frances went back to school last week, I have the semester off except for a 475 English Writing class. The point is that I go up to school with her and use the gym for free and the coaches have been good about letting me use the stadium for walking stairs (lot more fun than a Stairmaster). Being up at school also gives me the opportunity to use the computers and library for trail research.

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/25830,"I had a great day. I got to the campus this morning intending to walk the track for six or seven miles and do some stairs. As I was headed down into the stadium I ran into one of the athletes at school who recognized me from the newspaper article last semester. He asked when I was leaving and the usual questions about the trail; really a nice guy. We got to talking about walking stairs and the flat track and he made a suggestion that I go over to the soccer field. I had never been over there and it seems there is a big bluff of sorts that rings part of the field and goes up about 75 feet. It was perfect! I can go up at an angle and come down the same way, zig zagging up and down the bluff. When I get to the end of the bluff I can then walk around the rest of the field, about a quarter of a mile, and start all over again. What a workout! This also is much better on my feet; the track is hard rubber the bluff is grass. They also get a little testy about my trekking poles on the track, go figure.Today was the first real chance I've had to try and find my pace in the cold weather. It's a little hard to practice moderating body temperature when it's 75 degrees out, which it has been lately. It was 30 degrees when I started with the wind blowing a stiff 15 to 25, the wind chill 20 to 25 degrees. I wore lite-weight fleece bottoms with my wind pants, a lite-weight long sleeve liner shirt, lite-weight fleece top and my rain/wind jacket, fleece mitts and a beanie. I thought I was going to roast. Even after slowing down and finding my best pace, I was still venting just about everything. Well one big question got answered today the heavyweight fleece will be staying home. I also found that by slowing myself down from my usual 2.5 to 3 miles an hour pace to between 2 and 2.5 my endurance goes up drastically. I usually hit a wall around 4 miles, today the wall never came.Lastly I leave you with one I saw today on a church marquis,A cloudy day is no match for a sunny disposition.",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Thu",7

Well to begin, a month of waiting and anticipation. A month of long nights not being able to sleep, waiting for that seemingly far off time to gather myself and head out. A month of final preparations and in my case probably changing my mind at least twice a day, seems to be a bad habit of mine, but in the end I'll end up right where I am now. A month of contemplating leaving my wife and children for three months, absolutely the hardest part. A month of interviews and newspaper articles that need to be written and canned just in case. A month of conversations with friends old and new about what’s to come in the next 6 months. Lastly, 23 more days of driving my wife and kids off the deep end! Some cool things have transpired since my last post. Yesterday I found that my new pack is not going to cut it. Don't get me wrong, I like the jansport, I just don't need all that space. Would you believe that after waffling for two months and buying two new packs, I'm back to my ten year old north face, and that’s final, at least I think it is. One of my recent changes is going to stick though. In an earlier post I had decided to abandon the Whisperlite in favor of an Esbit stove. As it turns out neither is going on this trip. I ordered a new Trangia Alcohol stove and this thing is GREAT! I've made 2 meals with it now and can't understand why I was skittish about trying alcohol but I was. For those of you that might be wondering why? It was purely a matter of weight, Including fuel I save over a pound with the Trangia over the Whisperlite, and alcohol is readily available on the trail where Esbit pellets are not. I have also taken my 2-quart cook-pot and retired it in favor of a .8 qt alum non-stick. I've managed to get my total pack weight including food, fuel and water to less than 35 pounds. Dammit Janet I'm ready to trek! I've also spent the last 4 days with the pack on continuously. I did my first fully loaded 10 mile day yesterday, it just about killed me but I now know I can do it. Actually it wasn't all that bad, I just need to keep telling myself to slow down, that will be the hardest part of the first few days.Well I'm sure there is a lot more to come. Seems like everyday brings a new chapter in this saga. Thank you to everybody who has signed the guest-book and made so many wonderful comments. A couple people have asked questions as well, this is perfectly all right, and as a matter of fact you can be assured that every one will be answered even when I'm on the trail.To you kids out there, I pass along the Golden Rule (As told by my dad)“Just remember, he who makes the gold makes the rules.”",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Fri",10

I'll be glad to get this trip started for no other reason than I won't have to worry about these classes anymore. Truth is I made a major miscalculation on my hours this semester, I thought I was in good shape, but after talking with my financial aid counselor this week I learned that I'm 3 hours shy of the requirement! That means to make up the difference and still leave for the trail on time I have to do an entire 300 level Geography correspondence course in just over three weeks! It's really not all that bad, geography is my major and most of it is review for me. The only problem lies in the amount of writing it takes. Very time consuming. I'm not terribly concerned about getting it done; I just don't like to handle my education this way. If I spend about 6 to 8 hours a day on it I should be out with a couple of days to spare.    On a fun note, it snowed here this morning! I know there are some of you that are saying, ""You big doofus it's only snow"". Hey, this is southeastern Texas and 2 days ago it was 75. We havent seen snow in years. My 8yr old was to funny, when we woke him up to see the snow the first thing he said was, ""Is it Christmas already"". Boy I love that kid; he can sure make a grey day sunny.    I re-packed my bag again yesterday; my wife thinks I'm going to wear it out packing and re-packing all the time. I can't help it; I'm about as jumpy as kids on the last day of school. My feet and legs are sure ready to go; all week while I was hiking the track at school (with a pack) I had to keep slowing myself down. I'd get to thinking about something I had to do and the next thing I'd realize is that I'd be up to A 3.5+ mph pace. That may be a fine pace if youre trying to shape up by doing a couple of miles, but it sucks if youre trying to go all day. Maybe once we hit the trail the nervousness will pass and I'll slow down mentally and physically. No jokes about the mentally, this is something I really need to work on. Being a classic type A personality I have always gone from point A to point B at the speed of light. I have no idea how many times I've lain awake at night simply because I don't know how to turn the thinker off. That's one of the big things I hope to learn on this trip.    Well unfortunately I have to return to the grindstone.

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/26700,"Friendship, companionship, camaraderie these are terms that can be used to describe the experience of total strangers, who come together during a thru-hike. These are indeed very powerful words usually attributed to long time companions, not people meeting for the first time high atop a mountain. Add to this list trust, concern and any other word that would show you care for their well being.    I bring this up because I have been asked on numerous occasions how I could possibly be willing to trust the group I'm traveling with, having never met them. I don't really know the answer, but have never doubted the genuine willingness to help, shown by so many former AT hikers. I do trust them, and have made many decisions concerning equipment based on their recommendations, keeping in mind that a bad decision in this area can be vary costly indeed, possibly even harmful. The following is reprinted with permission from the author, The infamous Baltimore Jack. I think it shows the Esprit de corps passed on from group to the next. It occurs to me that if we could harness this feeling and apply it to our everyday lives, how many more people's lives would be enriched. Every one of us possesses experiences and gifts that can be passed on to others, in the doing, you yourself will grow from the experience. Baltimore JackOn a final note: I know many of you are going thru the somewhat frantic last period (2-3 weeks or so) before your departure, and you're juggling all sorts of stuff---last days at work; last chances to visit with family and friends; dealing with property storage, cars, pets, and so on; never mind all the last minute decisions on gear and equipment. Just wanted to tell you guys that as crazy as things may be right now, it WILL all fall together somehow, kinda like when you were involved in a school play years ago---for a zillion reasons, everyone thinks the show will be a horrific and embarrassing failure, but amazingly, everything falls into place on opening night; minor problems are eventually realized to be just that---minor---and the evening actually turns out just fine.And so it will be with your trips. Realize in advance that you CAN'T foresee or plan everything; there will be mistakes, omissions, regrets, usually dealing with gear choices, pack weight, and so on. These problems, while seemingly important at the time they present themselves, are usually nothing more than minor annoyances---you just have to deal with these things, stay flexible and remain open to changes in your planning or pacing, and move on from there.It is possible to over-prepare for a thru-hike, and to try to plan and micro-manage everything. This is impossible and will only drive you crazy. Take it one day at a time, take it slow for the first bit, pay attention to what you body is telling you; pay attention to other folks, to what they're carrying and using. Mistakes will certainly be made; try to learn from them so they don't get repeated.Most of all, take the time to enjoy yourselves out there: Start late in the morning when you want, or stop for the day earlier than you'd planned. When you see a ""scenic view"" sign or side trail, take a few minutes and go check it out. It's almost always worth while. Try to learn something in advance about plants, trees, wildflowers, birds, animals, astronomy; that way, you'll enjoy these things all the more when you encounter them. Take lots of breaks, wherever and whenever you want. Go at YOUR pace, and avoid basing your trip and your hiking schedule around other folks. If you're keeping an Internet journal, make it secondary to YOUR OWN journal, which is far more important. Keep a photo log, so in months and years to come, you'll know exactly what view or mountain you're looking at---I have hundreds of pretty pictures that I have no idea of where they are! Take more photos of other folks, and keep track of people's names and addresses. Write down the contact information of special people you meet, or folks who help you out.Lastly, don't worry about the small stuff, cuz that's what it is---small. There will be tough days, hard days, days you don't feel like moving, much less walking 15 miles. There will be many aches, pains, injuries and personal ailments. There will be stretches of horrible weather, wet stretches, cold ones, muddy ones, buggy ones, dry ones, bloody ones. Take them all in stride---the good times and good days VASTLY outnumber the bad ones. And when the going gets really tough, so tough that you're forced to evaluate what you're doing out there, and whether or not to continue, well, take a break, rest a bit, and ask yourself a few questions: Where would you rather be? What would you rather be doing? You wanna be back in a city, back at a desk, back in school? In almost every case, you'll realize how happy and lucky you are to be out there, and you'll be happy knowing you're doing what millions of folks only dream about. In short, you're about to embark on one of life's great adventures, so enjoy it to the fullest---most people only go this way once, so get the most out of it.It has been a great pleasure and privilege to get to know you guys here and elsewhere on the Internet; have a great, great time out there, and see ya down the line somewhere......I have no doubt that when I leave next week to begin the journey, that it's people like Jack who will have made it possible. I have never been conceded enough to think I knew it all, and was not afraid to ask for help. How much more I'm going to benefit for the asking. Better yet, how much more I'm going to benefit from their willingness to help.",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Wed",3
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/26741,"It occurred to me as I walked the campus today, that yesterday's post was incomplete. Not from a standpoint of the post itself, but how I was going to let the feelings and emotions captured in the piece affect me. I never really looked inside to see how I felt about how I handle my daily life and how I could change it to better reflect the sentiments stated. I have no answers yet, but I feel sure they will come in time.    Loose ends, seems like all I'm doing these days is tying up loose ends. That's OK though, 6 month ago I was trying to decide where to start the planning process. As I walk the campus these days I am still amazed how many people are aware of my trip and come up to me and make it beyond obvious that they would love to change places. Everytime this happens it re-enforces my belief that I am truly one of the luckiest people alive, more so that during the summer I'll get to experience this trip with my whole family.    Now for a little dose of reality, this trip is going to cost more than Money! I had my advisement session today for the Fall semester, I better enjoy the trip this year, next year is going to be a killer because of it. 21 hours including 4 science labs, just so I can catch up for slacking now. Hang on, just checking, Yep my wife's still laughing 5 hours later.     Finally for tonight, I have no idea if this is normal, but I have had the strangest feeling lately of the trip itself being anticlimactic. I know this must sound very odd to some people, but after being totally consumed in preparations for 6 months, having nothing to do but go has left a feeling, like there must be more, but there's not. I'm quite sure it will pass once I hit the trail and the new experiences bombard me from all sides. But right now the whole process almost feels empty.    One thing I know for sure is, all the people that have sent their words of encouragement, have meant more than they will ever know.",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Thu",0
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/26818,"Well one week from today, at this exact time, I will be boarding the Big Iron Horse bound for Atlanta. Seems almost surreal when I think about it, I'm preparing to leave my wife and kids, the new home I just built, my friends and other family, my school, my church and all other aspects of a normal daily routine life. Why? Because I feel the pull! If you have never experienced it you can never know how it truly feels. This is not something you can deny, to fight it is a new kind of study in futility. But I have found to follow it makes everything else so much clearer.    This morning as the family lays asleep and I write this post, I am more thankful than I have ever been for the wonders that god has placed in my life. First for a spouse who for unknown reasons has never questioned my desire for this quest, only supported and nudged when necessary. For 2 very special children who have not only helped and continue to help, but will be joining the experience in the summer. For parents who I am lucky enough to still have and who have supported this from the beginning. For a wonderful sister who along with a great husband and my 2 nieces will be with me as I start the journey at Springer Mountain.     The community in which we built our new home has also risen to the occasion. The people of the area have given me peace in the knowledge that if anything needs doing while I'm gone, Frances won't have any trouble. For my church family who I will see and worship with for the last time in many months, I say thank you for reviving in me the spirit of the lord.    These things I am truly thankful for on this Sunday morning.    Now on the trailside of things, a huge decision needs to be made. To Ultra-lite or Not!    I have to decide which is best for me at this time. I can go either way, I have the gear to be totally comfortable. I also have the gear (except for one piece) to go the ultra-lite route. By switching from my tent to a tarp, North Face backpack to a Go-lite Gust, Self-inflating pad to a foam pad, Water filter to Aqua-mira and so on I can save nearly 15 pounds on my pack weight.    You might ask why I have decided at the last minute to start this argument. Well I've been hiking quite a bit lately with a full pack to get ready. I have started to notice a couple of ominous signs from certain body parts. My right knee has been telling me to re-think the weight issue with every step, and my lower back seconds the motion everytime. This having been said, I'm about 25 pounds overweight, there is no doubt that I'll certainly lose this as I go down the trail. The problem lay's in whether or not my knee will give me the opportunity.     This will be decided in very short order, and once I do, that will be the end of the equipment decisions.     It's time now for me to go to church and thank God for all the amazing wonders around me.Remember: A cloudy day is no match for a Sunny Disposition.",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Sun",0

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/27906,"11:25am. Sunday the 23rd of February 2003Houston, Texas: Amtrak StationWell the trip has begun and I am more nervous than when I walked down the aisle on my wedding day. Boarding the train was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do! It was a simple action: walk up the steps and take a seat. But the entire experience has taken on a a surreal feeling. I feel detached, not altogether in control of the where and the when. For so long this was about the rediscovery of myself. Now it is almost like I could not care any less about that than I do right now. I am focused on who I am not. I keep trying to convince myself that I am up to the task. I do not want to be perceived as a failure. That too brings up a philosophical question as to the definition of failure. Is a person to be considered a failure if they do not finish the trail? What about those who give it their all but are physically not up to the task? Or those that have a limited amount of time… are they to be considered failures even though they did not quit?A jumble of thoughts and images continue to run through my head at breakneck speed looking for answers I cannot as yet supply. These and the other questions that are sure to arise will be answered in the coming days and months. I will not push; I will not search for meaning. I believe in my heart that these questions will be answered in their own way, at their own time.As for the trip itself, it starts with this train ride. I happen to be a mini version of John Madden. There is no way on God’s green Earth that you will get me to leave the ground. Besides, a train ride is the perfect way to start such an incredible experience as hiking the Appalachian Trail. Picture if you will, riding the old steam engine train into the west to start a new life in an untamed land. Crossing the wilds of our vast country on the iron horse and seeing at eye-level all she has to offer: from the downtown skyline of major cities such as Houston, New Orleans and Atlanta, to the backwoods bayou's of Louisiana and Mississippi. Moving from the flatlands of the Texas prairie to the rugged beauty of the Appalachian Mountain Range. All are visually impressed upon your memory from a standpoint of history and the iron rail. I cannot comprehend a more perfect beginning.With this in mind I move back to the present. I have been informed that my layover in New Orleans will not be quite what I had planned. Someone forgot to tell me that Mardi Gras is going on! What is worse, is that the train station is in the heart of downtown and is sure to be a nuthouse. I have always lived my life trying to make things bigger and better. Tonight I will attempt to become a fly on the wall. Why? Let us see. We have one of the world’s most dangerous cities in a full party mode, which already has a reputation for being out of control. Now stick me into the middle of that. Now include a backpack and thousands of dollars in electronics. This is a no-brainer! Well the conductor assures me that there is an area within the station that is secure in the evening and I should have no problems. We will see. The ride itself has been most pleasurable to this point. I am sitting downstairs in a deserted snack car. The only other soul here is an off duty conductor catching a ride back home. He is a wonderful gentleman, full of stories funny and old. How can people fly? So sterile the whole process seems to be: wait at the gate, get on as quickly as you can, fly across the country in a matter of a few hours and get off as quickly as you can. The adventure is in the travel itself! You fly and you might meet one person, whoever is sitting next to you. How depressing! Think of all the wonderful personalities that you could encounter if only you had the time. Here on the train this is never an issue, time is something in great supply and the situation is as conducive of companionship as any I have ever seen. Children are happy. People are open and smiling. Conversations are spontaneous and frequent. Throw in a restaurant and a bar, and now you have a breeding ground for happy times. I recommend that everyone try traveling on a train, but only if you are willing to come out of your shell.","Houston, Texas

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/27965,"Meridian Mississippi. 6:00pm February 24th 2003We are six hours behind schedule. The train left New Orleans four hours late and we have since lost another two hours. We will not be getting into Atlanta until sometime after 2:00 am, I almost wish they would go ahead and slow down so we would arrive in the daylight. Of course this is not going to happen. We continue to lose, not gain time. Today has been one of the saddest days I have had to endure while planning this trip. Struggling through the surgery was no comparison to this morning when I checked my e-mail from the station in New Orleans. We lost the heart of “Pack 31,” Ted (Soleman) Anderson. Ted passed away on Sunday. No one had the slightest clue that anything was wrong and we all had expected to see Ted this Thursday on top of Springer Mountain. As with most members of “Pack 31” I had never met Ted in person, but after many months of planning together, playing together and a total commitment to the group, Ted had become like family. “Pack 31” will have a large gap on Saturday morning where “Soleman” would have been, but I know that each one of us will carry him in our hearts for the remainder of this trek and our lives.The remainder of the overnight wait was anything but boring, security kept the place jumping by making sure that no one put themselves in jeopardy by closing their eyes. I am so grateful that they protected my person with such diligence. They work day and night to protect the innocent from the criminally and mentally insane. Speaking of mentally insane, now is a good time to talk about the personage henceforth known as ""Grandma.""Some people have a weakness of temper that no medication yet discovered could control. “Grandma” is one such person. Arriving at the station like a Tasmanian devil she headed straight for the gate. Unlike the rest of the station population she had yet to be informed that the train was delayed by a minimum of four hours. Unfortunately it now fell to the diminutive gate attendant to make this fact known and transform Grandma into ""Gramzilla."" Over the course of the next four hours “Gramzilla” paced the station floor spewing forth her newest and latest epithets for the American passenger-rail system. The round robin of passengers’ attempts to calm the beast now began. A sweet lady and her daughter from San Diego were the first to attempt the impossible. The reality of the situation set in upon the “San Diegonites” and they gracefully left “Gramzilla” to continue her dialog of disgust. “Gramzilla” was the entertainment that Amtrak generously provided to all their waiting passengers.I mentioned before the atmosphere of the travel by rail. Almost as if drawn together by a need for laughter, a group of six people slowly formed. Two members, Craig and Richard were from (and I am not making this up) Nottingham, England, two miles from Sherwood Forrest. They too are headed to Atlanta before continuing their tour by heading north. Another member, Scott, was 29 and heading back to college at Georgia Tech. Scott was clearly the instigator of this group, but a great guy just the same. Mark, the Director of an Alcohol and Drug rehabilitation facility working with the Texas prison system, clearly was the quickest wit of the bunch. Of course, the group could not be complete without a Southern Belle: Little Lisa from Birmingham, Alabama. Oh, and of course my self, just a sheep among wolves. Craig and Richard will certainly take back a different perspective of the American people, and it is my sincere hope that the rest of the country does not hold it against us.I have just been informed that our arrival time has moved to 1:00 am Eastern Time. That is great, but it is still about six hours late. I guess it will have to do.","Reflections On Amtrack To Louisiana

I have received numerous emails recently asking about John's progress and how the equipment, food, etc. are working out. I should tell you that John has sent home some gear already. He gave his tent away, opting to buy a lighter one from a disgruntled, fellow hiker. He has reorganized his food. Instead of carrying gorp, he has elected to avoid the weight and eat snickers instead (go figure, I guess we should be investing in that company instead of Mr. Peanut). His dinner packages that he made himself contain instant rice, bouillon and dehydrated meat. Although he is using the heavy-duty freezer baggies, the rice is puncturing the bags. He has had to look for other ways to keep his food dry. Also, sending homemade beef jerky is a ""no go"". The jerky, although packaged in an airtight ziploc freezer bag, is mildewed by the time it gets to him. Another problem is the protein bars. It is so cold up there that they are as hard as bricks! These too have been sent home. His appetite is not as he expected and so he has returned many of his snack foods. However, he expects that he will be gaining in appetite soon enough and that these calories will once again be needed. I hope that I have been able to help you all with your questions. I know that you probably still have more, please feel free to leave a message in the guest book and I will try to address you all as best I can.

Hiking the little hills of Texas has in no way prepared me for the AT. Just the one hill (up Sassafrass Mountain from Horse Gap) had me wheezing like an asthmatic in a smoke shop—and that was only one of the five climbs I had today. The good news is…today was better than yesterday. Tomorrow will be a test though. We will have to push it up to twelve miles to make the next shelter. That’s ok, “Slow Ride” and I will just take it slow and steady. A really cool thing happened today, they call it “trail magic.” When we came into Horse Gap there were a couple of bags hanging from a tree. Inside there used to be goodies for through-hikers, but they were empty. Just as we hit the road, Ken pulled up to restock the bags. He offered “Slow Ride” and I sodas that were incredible after the PUD’S and then he headed off to restock. We got to the shelter about 2:30 p.m. and there were already three people here.

When I got to Woody Gap I found Anna from the Forum with some ""trail magic"" and decided along with ""Crumb Snatcher"", ""Trapper Mike"" and several others to call it a day. We got a lift into Suches where we got enough hot dogs and chili to feed a small army. We spent the whole evening creating a little ""trail magic"" of our own, as we fed probably twelve or so hikers chili and hotdogs. Everything was wonderful... but (you knew there would be a but didn't you) then came the wind. The temperature dropped, and I mean the bottom fell out! We had a roaring fire going but it had little to no effect. By 6:00 p.m. the temperature was below freezing and the wind was at 30-40 plus miles per hour. I guess it was no surprise that everyone headed for their tents by 7:00 p.m. I left my boot on my right foot. After discussing it with several people it was a consensus that I should keep it on until I hit Neel's Gap tomorrow. As soon as I let the pressure off of it I expect to have a lot of swelling.

First I got into the shop at 8:30 a.m. to square away my gear situation. I have picked up several new items including the Dana Designs Wet Rib. This is going to make a huge difference in the way my pack carries. I sent the clunky headlamp home in lieu of a two-ounce Black Diamond. The Platypus Bladder went home as the Wet Rib has a one-quart nalgene. I refilled with fuel and picked up several food items I had been craving. I will not say where I bought it from; but I picked up a brand new, Sierra Designs two man Light-year CD Tent for $50. “Grumpy” had a tent that weighed as much as a fair-sized wood building. It did not take much convincing to get him to throw it out and accept my old tent as a gift. I do not know why, but I just felt the need to pass on the magic. I also picked up a new hiking hat. I feel it serves to identify me a little more appropriately than the old one (see the picture).After a long conversation with the outfitter over various bag options, I went back to my own backpack with a pair of scissors in hand and proceeded to turn it into a lightweight pack. First I removed the top pocket, and all of the straps. After I was done I had saved a pound and one-half. In the box I sent home went the PDA, keyboard, mini tape recorder, and several other items that had never been used. By the time all was said and done I had shaved 14 pounds from the pack. What a difference!Around 11:00 a.m. “Pack 31” finally came stumbling down from Blood Mountain. The first I saw was “Wench” (what a great gal). “Hotdog” and “Shoe” were not far behind. There were big hugs, handshakes and good feelings all around. “Wench’s” mom had made handkerchief-type rags with a picture of “Soleman” on them for all of “Pack 31.” Jan gave me mine and it made me feel very odd. I had been dodging the subject of Ted’s death for days, now I had to deal with it.I spent the afternoon getting to know them all including “A-Train,” “Speck,” “Red,” “Speck’s” sister Julia now known as “Slip Rock,” “Underpants” (I swear he hikes the trail in a pair with the fly in front and that is ALL besides a T-shirt), “Subman” and the rest. “Light Shoe” had to leave the trail that afternoon for a planned trip, but she will be back Saturday.

But we felt so good after lunch that we went on and got here around 4:30 p.m. We arrived just in time too. The shelter is packed and it is supposed to rain. That is okay though, we got the last three spaces.I felt so much stronger today. The PUD's are still a pain but I've found a pace that lets me keep going. None of the mountains today were all that bad. But tomorrow looks like a killer! ""Hotdog"" and ""Wench"" are two truly amazing people.

I am not talking about a thunderclap, but the heavy rolling stuff that lasts 30 to 60 seconds. You could hear it building as it came down the mountain and hit like a train. It would scare you, awe you, and make you want more all at the same time. And rain, it rained like Noah’s deluge! It has been said before, and I am starting to believe it ""God pities the foolish.” About 5:30 a.m. the rain stopped, the clouds parted and when the sun came up it was a beautiful, wonderful day! The plan all along had been to make Unicoi Gap and go into Helen, Georgia. When we got there at about 2:30 p.m. I made a comment about blowing off town and getting a jump on tomorrow by climbing Rocky Mountain tonight. I did not think they would take me seriously (nobody else does). But that is what we did! We found a great campsite right on top and were joined there by “Early Riser” and “Denmark.” That 1000’ climb today was a butt kicker but we are all glad we got it out of the way now.

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/28155,"I got into town around 1:00 p.m. and headed straight for the Blueberry Patch with “Wench.” “Hotdog” went to a hotel in town. This morning at about 2:00 a.m. “Hotdog,” “The Dutchess,” and I had the experience of meeting another bear! He walked right past the “Dutchess’s” tent and directly between “Hotdog” and I. We were approximately five feet apart. It was snorting and grunting, and at first I thought it was “Hotdog” snoring again. It was not until “Hotdog” asked, “What was that?” that I realized he was not sleeping! The bear did not bother anything though. He just kept on going.I got up early today, as well as the rest of the group, in order to get a jump on the crowd that was heading for town. I wanted to stay at the hostel and I knew it would fill up fast. Gary and Lennie Poteat from the Blueberry Patch are two of the most generous people I have ever met. They are just wonderful! They had fresh fruit waiting and were so welcoming, it was like coming home to family. These folks are very genuine and love what they do. If you are planning a hike, make sure you stop here. We are not sure about tomorrow, whether we will walk or take the day off. The general consensus is to go have an al you can eat buffet at Daniel’s Restaurant in town, then we will decide.Well, we are back from dinner and have taken a vote. It played out like this: “Wench:” walk; “Dutchess:” walk; “Early Riser:” walk; and “Bearkat:” walk. So tomorrow morning we will head out.

Blueberry pancakes, sausage, cheese biscuits, orange juice and coffee were all served at a big table on the porch overlooking the mountains. It made leaving very difficult. There was really no reason not to take a zero day; as a matter of fact it probably would have been for the best!There is some speculation that my toe may not have only dislocated. I may have broken it. It is not getting much better, but I can still hike and so I will. “Wench’s” feet are killing her. “Early Riser” has a blister problem. “Dutchess” is fighting dehydration. Are we not a lovely group?The biggest problem is that none of us is very comfortable in town. I cannot explain it, only to say that we push to get to town and almost immediately we are rushing to get out. It is so complicated in town. On the trail it is simple and regimented. You get up, pack up, hike, stop and set up, eat, talk a while and then go to bed by 7:30 or 8:00 p.m. On a different level, this was a big day. We became two-staters today! No more Georgia, it is North Carolina now! What a feeling of elation; we know that we still have over 2,000 miles to go, but to cross that first state line was amazing!I talked to my wife last night and she said that people had asked for any kind of list of what got sent home. So, here you go. If you are planning on carrying a candle lantern, leave it at home. You will not be up that late anyhow. Leave the trowel at home, your pole tips work just find for digging holes. I heard people talking about zero-degree sleeping bags, do not waste your money. A twenty-degree is all you need. I sweat in mine. Leave the water filters at home for now, you can have it sent later. The rains have meant good water supplies and aqua-mira is all you need. I added a wet rib (see the picture for the previous day’s journal entry) and a one-quart, hard sided nalgene. I sent the platypus home. The wet rib is great. I put my camera and lunch in it and I never have to get into my pack during my hike. I have seen several camping pillows, leave them home.

BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/28251,"Hi everybody! I just read a guest book entry from David Miller that has triggered some responsible bone in my body (from where I’m not sure) and I thought I should address some issues that I am sure many of you have. By the way David is in need of a trail name. He has a journal on line here, and he is taking “nice” suggestions.First, when it comes to food. As you may have read previously, Bearkat has changed his food around. He had prepared his own meals and had prepackaged them to go in his supply boxes. However, after about one week on the trail he decided that there was a better alternative. Hence, he now purchases Lipton instant rice or noodles (whatever flavor he wants) and a pouch of tuna, chicken, or ham. This makes a very nice, tasty, fulfilling, and delicious dinner. This meal costs less than $2.00. Additionally, he takes a 10-pack of Milky Way (his favorite) snack-size candy bars with him. These are 10 for $1.00 and he usually eats about 4 of these a day. Additionally, he tries to keep a pouch of instant oatmeal on him for those mornings that he wants breakfast. He always has Gatorade mix on hand to resupply his nutritional needs. These come in individual pouches that you can add water to (about $.85 each) or you can buy a canister and break it up into packages for your resupply box. The beef jerky that we made before he left was tasty but did not make the trip. Our most economical way of handling this was to purchase pouches of jerky from Sam’s and send them through the resupply box. Finally, we have found that Kroger’s sells the small summer sausages that are about 6-8 oz. and along with peanut butter crackers (from Sam’s $3.95 for a HUGE box) these are perfect for lunch.Second, let’s talk about planning. It doesn’t work! Enough said, right? Ha, ha, ha. No really, planning is a good thing. The only problem is that it is VERY difficult to do. You plan before you leave, but things change when you get there. You can’t keep up with the pace you set for yourself, or your pace is better than you expected. In Georgia alone, the steep inclinations are TOUGH! There are points on the trail that you are literally climbing hand over foot up the side of what looks like a cliff! These are not going to be your BEST paced days. How can you truly be prepared for such a hike? You can’t. How many people can plan on stubbing their toe going “downhill?” Right? And so it is important to keep in mind that you must be fluid. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t know what you’re coming up to. Be aware of your surroundings, do your homework. Also, you will have your handbook with you, so all is not lost. Bearkat sent home his handbook and only kept out about 4-5 pages of the upcoming towns. I send him the next ones with his resupply box. Third, let’s talk about mail drops. There are very few that are definite. What generally happens is that about every three or four days I get a phone call from Bearkat. We visit and then he tells me his plans for the next three or four days. At this time he knows where he wants his next package to be sent and I send it two-day express through the US post office. This has been our routine. When he picks up his package, he generally sends me his journal entries and film.So this leads to a new item, journal entries and film. While it is a common habit to have pocket mail as a through hiker on the trail, it is not essential. It is also not essential to have a digital camera. We have both, a digital camera and an Olympus 35mm. Bearkat opted to use the Olympus because of the weather conditions that may effect the digital. This means that the mail carries his rolls of film back to me. His packages to me are marked “do not x-ray, film enclosed.” Since I live in Texas, it takes his mail packages about 5 days to get to me, no more than this. I have his film developed onto disc in one hour at Walmart. This costs $3.89 per roll. The Olympus takes incredible pictures and although Walmart is frustrating and nothing is ever developed in one hour, I have found that sending the pictures out for development costs the same if not more than $3.89. I hope I have enlightened some of you. If you have any more questions, please feel free to write, I am happy to help you anyway I can.",,Addressing Some Reader's Questions - Mrs. Bearkat,"Mar 09, Sun",0
BearKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/28301,"Cold! Man it was really cold this morning. “Wench’s” thermometer said nineteen degrees, and the rain fly covered it inside. For some reason we let “Dutchess” and “Early Riser” talk us into an early start. By unanimous decision (meaning, “Wench” and I) we will not do that again. If the two of them want to tear out without a hot breakfast, they can. We will not. I did make good time today, eight miles to Standing Indian Shelter by 1:00 p.m. That included going over Sharp Top and Courthouse Bald. Climbing both of those mountains felt like I was going straight up! The flip side is that Standing Indian Mountain (the biggest peak yet) was no big deal. The switchbacks were easy and it never really got steep.I ran into one of the final south-bounders from 2002 today at Muskrat Creek Shelter. “Gizmo” was just packing up to leave when my group arrived at around 10:00 a.m. for a snack. He is a great guy with some good trail wisdom. Something he had that I found interesting was a three-candle lantern. It doubled as his stove. I did not get a chance to see it in action. Apparently it has worked for him the last nine months.I got into an international discussion on politics with “Dutchess” today. She is from Denmark. Our discussion was over the way we do things here in the states. I will not say that it got heated, but I will say that we covered the last three miles in under an hour. “Wench” spent the whole time just trying to stay out of the way!Something else I am remembering to mention… if you are going to be using the maps of the trail, learn to read the topographical features. The profile is garbage. I have counted at least nine climbs that have not been on the profile and that applies to only the last three days! If you trust the profile to plan your day, you are going to hate it!“Heald” from Neel’s Gap caught up with us today. He is a great guy with almost 10,000 Appalachian Trail miles. I think I will pick his brain a little bit tomorrow. That should be fun. Tomorrow we will go on to Big Spring Shelter.

His answer was classic: When you get to a giant rock wall with blazes going straight up, you are there.That boy did not lie, it was a 600 climb in 3/10 of a mile!Well I will say this, there is no way to describe the beauty from the top. It is funny that I use that word, because we also crossed Big Butt Mountain. You should have seen the heads turn when Wenchbusted out with Sir-Mix-Alots I Like Big Buttssong as we went over the top. How is it that we have not been arrested yet?Wenchand I did what we said, no one is going to push us anymore to leave early. Early Riserand Dutchesshave been pushing to leave early and that has stopped. We left late, ate a big breakfast, and had a great day. Forgetting the aches and pains, we made seven miles in three hours and that included some up hills too.Hike your own hike. I do not know how many times I have been told that, now it makes sense. I wonder how much better my foot would be if I had not pushed so hard the last couple of days. Tomorrow we pass another milestone; we become 100-milers! That is good because it is time for a day off. Franklin tomorrow and then maybe a zero day, that would be the smart play.It has been brought up that we have not had to actually hike in any type of serious rainstorm yet. There are plenty of trees around to knock on, but I would love to know the last time there were this many sunny days in a row in March.Yesterday we met a father and son team out for a week of Appalachian Trail hiking. Duwain and his son Elliot, it turns out, are from the Austin area. They have been a great addition to the group. Duwain is a civil engineer in the Austin area.

The only problem was that it was all down hill to NOC and the rain made the trail REALLY treacherous. It was very surreal coming down from the mountain. We were in between two cloud layers and this had the effect of deadening all sounds. It was very cool hiking this way, right up to the point where my feet went one way and my butt went another. Note to self: daydreaming on a slick side of a hill equals BAD IDEA! It would not have been so bad but this was the one day that my knee and foot felt really good, so I did not wear my knee brace. Well, I am wearing it now!We got to NOC shortly after noon and some friends of “Wench” (Bob and Joyce Falkins) had come up to visit. They were really neat people who took us out to lunch. NOC is a very cool place right on the river, the restaurant overlooks it and you can watch the kayakers in the rapids. The outfitter is well stocked with gear but if you are planing on resupplying food here, think twice. When they say short-term resupply, they mean it. While we were down at the outfitters we ran into some of the other hikers in our old group. “Crumbsnatcher” just finished a 30-mile slackpack yesterday without Bear (his dog). He headed back out with Bear so we should catch up with him tomorrow. The guys of Yellow Submarine (three guys in one yellow and very small two-man tent) are just ahead as well. “Slow Rider” headed out late and we will definitely catch up with him tomorrow.The discussion this evening has been revolving around whether “Liteshoe” will catch us soon. We think she is no more than a day behind us at this point, but we have no real idea. We are staying at the hostel for the night and are at this moment sharing the common dining room with about 30 kids from the University of Wisconsin Cycling Team. These kids have more energy than is proper. They ride hard all day and they are still wound up at night! Oh to be young! I actually had a chance to talk with one of the coaches about various power drinks and endurance foods. The problem is that after watching them eat, my pack would weigh about 100 pounds with their type of food. Man it looks great!“Hotdog” reports that his knee is feeling good.

Well, it is NEXT YEAR! So here's the deal, I am not going to pressure up like I did the first time, if i go 200 Freaking Awesome, if I through it AWESOME! What I am going to do this time, is enjoy the ride, enjoy the company, enjoy the fact that I am back on the trail, and spend time with my eye's open and looking at the vistas. That was truly the greatest tragedy on my first attempt. I had this feeling that I needed to be doing it with style, That I needed to not be seen as a slacker, there were miles to cover and cover them I would. People were reading this journal literally by the 10's of thousands, I began to have this self imposed pressure of must push on, write more, keep them interested. That my friends is when I lost the trail, not before. When I say with my eyes open, I mean it. One thing that has truly and deeply bothered me about that experience years ago, is that I put my head down, and focused on my rhythm, my pace, Like a runner in a marathon, focusing all your energy into just pushing on, not letting yourself be distracted. OMG, What I know now that I forgot then, being distracted is the true beauty of the trail. Letting yourself be immersed in the sights and sounds. Can you hear the stream, is that bird following me, DAM my feet are loud! Allowing yourself the luxury of not giving a flip whats over the next hill, but enjoying the here and now.

A few years ago, I retired the Old Lowe Alpine backpack in favor of a North Face Prophet 45 and will be using this small but great pack during this trip. The old Wetrib I had got lost in a move, and folks, replacing that was a small nightmare, they were not made for several years I guess, and I just got lucky to find someone selling one (I wouldn't pack without one). I understand that Mystery Ranch is carrying them again if your looking. I have used the same sleeping bag for close to ump-tine years and will not be switching now, North Face Cats Meow 20+ for me anyday.
I will be adding and updating as I go, but it is amazing how much of my original equipment will be making this trip as well. Why reinvent the wheel right.
Now comes the part where I ask for YOUR help. One thing that has changed so dramatically over the last 15 years is clothing! Any and all recommendations on footwear and clothing will be great appreciated.  As for footwear, I am a low top guy, waterproof for sure (I may or may not always pay attention to what I am stepping in :/), any thoughts?
In case you are wondering, YES I worry about weight, BUT not to the extreme. I could easily carry a lighter tent than my Sierra designs Light Year 1. But Familiarity to me is more important than saving 1 pound. I can set that tent up in the pitch black in record time. I'll trade that for a pound anytime.
There are other conveniences that will add some weight as well, like a self inflating insulated sleeping pad. Last time I bought a good Thermarest on day 3 @ Walasi-Yi @ Neels Gap, the 3 days leading to it I froze my A%^ Off.
I am not mister super hiker, not even close. If you see an opportunity for me to improve, I am all ears.
I will continue to update my gear list as it changes or is finalized.
