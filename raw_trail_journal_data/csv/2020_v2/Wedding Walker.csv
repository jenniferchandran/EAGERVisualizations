Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630880,Stopped in Ohio on my way to Virginia AT section hike and stayed with our good friends Mark and Kathi. Besides the great food and conversation I got to see their 13’ tall Wizard carved from a dead elm tree in the ravine behind their house!,,View Entry,"Sep 23, Wed",0
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630909,"After 5 years off, I’m back on the AT and day 1 went pretty well. Started off following the James River and then streams and then some fairly serious elevation changes for a flat lander from Chicago. I didn’t expect the change of fall colors here but that added to the beauty of the hike. Filtered nice cold water from one stream and a spring - nothing like it!","James River Footbridge

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630920,"Rained (guessing 1.5”) all day today so glad I built some extra time into hiking time into my schedule and that I brought my son’s tent instead of the much smaller tarp tent I used last time. During the couple times the rain subsided I filtered some water and checked on my bear bag (I think there is a picture of bear bag in photos section). I’m sure some of you who know me are thinking “he’s always busy and moving- he must have gone crazy”. The rain was (mostly) very peaceful so I tried meditating; can’t say I was successful as my mind kept going different places but something I should probably get better at. Also listened to several chapters of one of Father Richard Rohr’s audiobooks who I really enjoy his daily emails. Since yesterday I had elevation changes moving up and down from 600’ to 2,600’ and tomorrow reaching 4,000’ probably wasn’t bad to start slow.","Marble Spring

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630954,"After spending all yesterday in the tent because of the rain, today’s first task was hanging the various parts of the tent in bushes to clean and dry (see pics). Met quite a few people on trail today- mostly section hikers like me and some Virginia Tech students out for the day. Fog cleared for some great views and I re-entered civilization at an overlook off the Blue Ridge Parkway where nice smelling people  (not hikers) were taking pics (including a couple taking their wedding photos). After 5 years “off the trail” I re-started my hike with some pretty steep elevations (I took a screenshot) but I’ve taken it slow so I’m feeling fine and weather was cool and perfect today. Sleeping in tent near one of the appx 250 shelters along the 2,100 mile Appalachian Trail. Due to COVID I’m not sleeping in shelters plus a comment in the online Guthook Guide says this one had “more mice than Disneyland” so even more reason to skip it!","Marble Spring

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630968,"One of the two volunteers I met the other day said there was a SSP (Sweet smelling privy) at Thunder Hill Shelter. It was one of the nicest privies of seen but I’d say the smell was neutral which is comparatively excellent for privies. The screech owls (I think)!in this area make the wildest sounds- I almost thought it was a coyote till I asked another hiker. The other sound early this morning was a huge branch falling. The two women at the shelter were concerned it was near my tent but It wasn’t and I always try to remember to look up before I pitch my tent. My hike today was mostly a descent and  harder on the knees that an ascent (and I couldn’t practice descents of a treadmill at home). Passed under an aptly name rock formation, the “Guillotine” and up to an FAA tower at 4,225’ (see photos). Stopped at Bryant  Ridge Shelter which is an amazing two story structure with a stream wrapping around it. Four local hikers walked past the shelter including a mother with her daughter. The mom had heard so much about the shelter from her family members she wanted to see it herself","Thunder Ridge
",Bryant Hill Shelter,"Sep 27, Sun",10.50
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630995,Left the shelter by 8AM as I had a longer day ahead of me plus I slept in the shelter vs my tent so packing up was quicker. The bad part of being out early is that you so get to break though the is spider webs that stretch across the trail (I can see our oldest son and daughter cringing now). But as I met another hiker we thanked each other for clearing the webs. I’ve really appreciated my Ininji toe socks this trip - no blisters! I decided yesterday I better rinse them out but they weren’t dry so my pack also functions as a portable drying rack. Met up with 5 sets of section hikers (doing part of the AT vs a thru hiker who does the whole trail).  The AT was shut down to hikers earlier this year so typically I would be running into southbound hikers who start in Maine in the summer but have not met any of those yet. Getting space in a shelter was key tonight since 1.4” of rain are expected thru tomorrow and I will probably need to wait out the rain for the day. So after 13.6 miles plus .2 miles down to the shelter I was worried when I saw quite a few hikers that the site might be full.  Turned out to be 4 guys from Connecticut who are taking a gap year between high school and college. Nice group but I was laughing to myself when they were talking about the presentation they gave to their parents to get their approval to do their section hike.,"Bryant Hill Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631054,Rain (another 1.75”) again changed the hiking plan. Luckily when my youngest son helped me with my hike plan (as he has more experience hiking in elevations) we built in some extra time because today I sat in the shelter all day. Besides me in the shelter there were the 4 high school friends hiking. A guy from California stopped for water and he had lived in several cities where I had relatives. The friend he is hiking with is going to owe him dinner since the friend decided it would be shorter to walk the road (Blue Ridge Parkway) not the trail and missed the shelter resulting in the California guy hauling 10 lbs plus of water back to his friend (they were both Purdue grads). Next two Penn State grads (but are 60+ like me) came to the shelter. They had hiked together in college and are hiking part of the AT together.  Piped spring at shelter was really easy to get water from but after all the rain water was cascading over the top,"Bobblets Gap Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631055,"Up by 6am and on the trail before 7 meant I used my headlamp and puffy jacket for the first time hiking but knew I had a long day ahead. The heavy rainfall periodically turned the trail into a small stream and other times really amped up the waterfalls and streams I passed or crossed. Met more section hikers including Cotton whose goal is to make it to the AT halfway point in Pennsylvania. After listening to other hikers talk about the delicious food options in Daleville I must have spent at least an hour thinking about food! As I was hiking I realized everything piece of clothing needed to be washed (and going to the hotel laundry room in only my raincoat wouldn’t be a good option) my first stop was Goodwill to buy a tshirt and shorts ($7). I then satisfied part of my “hiker hunger” at Three Pigs BBQ with a delicious dinner. After other errands I walked to my hotel, 19.8 miles in all, called my lovely wife and took a nice shower.","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631073,"Enjoyed a couple more town meals then Packerbacker (originally from Wisconsin, home of Green Bay Packers) picked me up for my next section hike. Packerbacker parked his car in Daleville and Bubba (AT shuttle driver) drove us 90 minutes south to Bland and the plan is to hike 140 miles northbound back to Daleville (estimated arrival date of October 12). We then met Sundance (forgot to ask him how he got his trail name) and did a couple steep miles to get to Helveys Mills Shelter where there is a 6 person shelter and plenty of space for our tents. Four very nice twenty-something’s are here too including a couple from the Midwest, a guy from Pennsylvania and Loofa (like the plastic mesh dish scrubber which hangs from his pack from Texas).  All are flip flippers who started near the middle of trail, hiked to Maine and then came back to the middle and will finish in Georgia. Tonight temps are scheduled to get below freezing (coldest night on trail for the flip flippers) so we all put our water filters in our sleeping bags with us so they don’t freeze and break.","Bland

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631111,"Woke up once shivering last night so had to fully zip up my sleeping bag to get warm again. After a cup of coffee, Packbacker (correct trail name), Sundance and I set out a fairly short day (10 miles) to the next shelter. Water options are pretty limited out here so Packbacker has done a nice job of making sure water is available each night. Built a fire and two guys from Amelia Island, Florida joined us. One hiked 600 miles on the AT but hasn’t hiked it in 14 years and this is his friend’s first time on AT. One of guys is ultralight backpacker and uses a tarp w sticks from the woods for his tent. Then he puts his sleeping bag with a small piece of foam into a bivvy sack. His pack weighs about 10 pounds less than mine so he doesn’t mind the extra weight of his bourbon.","Helveys Mills Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631195,"Highlight of today’s 15 mile hike was Dismal Falls, perfect lunch spot and place to soak our feet in the cold water. Day was nice and cool with rhododendron tunnels and the Roanoke Trail Club built wooden bridges over deep gullies plus an impressive suspension footbridge. Tomorrow will be our last hiking day with Sondance (corrected trail name) and I found out more about the book he is publishing next year titled “Dancing with the Mountains.  Alzheimer’s, Angels and the Appalachian Trail, a journey of spirit”. It is a story about his father (who has Alzheimers) and Sondance (who hiked the AT in 2009 as a fundraiser for Alzheimers). I’d recommend you email Paul (Sondance) at pctravers@comcast.net to get on the mailing list fir info on the book’s release in spring of next year. Paul has many great stories including sleeping overnight in an old Arlo Guthrie band bus (surreptitiously on Arlo’s property), the ceremony where he was “knighted” with his trail name by a trekking  pole and a shower of whiskey but he also describes the power of the Appalachian Mountains as a healing place. He tells me his website Www.paultravers.com has info on his previous Pearl Harbor book, history-related interests and will add details in the future about his next book.","Jenny Knob Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631200,"17.9 mile day to get to Pearisburg today and it began with an “up” from 2,600’ to 4,000. Trail was quite overgrown with vegetation and very rocky for long distances which slowed our progress but we had some nice outlooks to see the landscapes below. Mountain Mike from Angels Rest Hiker Hostel Haven (awesome place and staff!) picked us up at the Pearisburg trailhead and for $16 we got a tent site (they have bunk house plus private cabins), shower and laundry. After a resupply trip at Food Lion we brought Mexican carry out back to a large common room with a full kitchen. Met Rockflipper ( has only 400 miles left on his thru hike) plus had a beer and had some fun conversations with 6 pack and Thirsty Bear. 6 pack recently finished his service with the Marines and started his hike with an 80 lb pack! Thirsty Bear was a very successful trader/finance guy who was able to retire after 20 years and hit the trail and is loving it, especially the trail community. Both of these guys lost 30 lbs in just a few weeks of hiking which reminds me I better go eat my leftover fajitas for breakfast. Thanks for following my journal and for your notes of support in my Guest Book.","Wapiti Shelter 
",Pearisburg,"Oct 05, Mon",17.90
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631212,Heavy dew made for very wet tents this morning plus food shopping while “hiker hungry” resulted in  heavy food bag. Not a great combination. Mountain Mike drove Packerbacker and I to the trailhead without Sondance as he stayed at another hostel last night. On the way up the trail we met a local (Gobbler) who is 76 years old and has done an 8 mile trail (with ascent to 4000’) 195 times this year! We also met 2 guys (Wardrobe and Spice Rack) who warned of us a Copperhead snake not too far ahead. Luckily Packbacker saw the snake who didn’t mind being moved out of the way too much. View of West Virginia from Rice Shelter overlook was one of widest views we’ve had so far. Since a hurricane in the south looks like it will make for a rainy weekend we hiked further than planned to a campsite on a ridge with a fire ring and just enough room for a few tents.,"Pearisburg

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631318,"Lots of rocks in the trail today plus overgrown vegetation made it a long (17.9 miles) and challenging day. War Spur Shelter had a perfect, rhododendron-canopied stream so I had a chance to rinse off. At the shelter was a local who was day hiking from the shelter. He is also maintains 2.5 miles of the AT for the Roanoke Trail Club (one of the key groups that selflessly maintain the trail). No easy task for him, hiking several miles with a weed wacker and fuel.  One of the things he was reporting back was appx 16 trees across the trail. At my height of 6’2” and with a 28lb backpack, the challenge of going under a 4’ - 5’ tree crossing the trail is I use one arm to swing under it. Better than crawling on the ground but I think I need to work on some different sets of muscles. The three of us capped off the evening with a camp fire.","Ridge line campsite

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631319,"An epic day- at a remote crossing we came across Fresh Ground’s hiker feast van where he was cooking up free breakfast for hikers! I’ve read and seen YouTube videos about Fresh Grounds and his “trail magic” but since he usually follows the hiker bubbles I never thought I’d experience it.  Amazing blueberry pancakes, eggs, sausage and coffee right there at a trail crossing!  At the feast we met a large group of hikers who started in Maine in July including Gravity (originally from Michigan) and her teenage son. Later in the day we met another group of 8 southbounders including Treeboy who had a backpack guitar. Toughest part of day was when we had to walk hundreds of yards on huge, sloped pieces of granite right on the edge of the ridge.  Very glad it wasn’t raining!  Also passed the Keffer Oak (largest tree on the AT) and went past the Eastern Continental Divide.","War Spur Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631320,"Today we began the section of the trail that includes 3 highlights (Dragons Tooth, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs). On the way to Dragons Tooth we had the opportunity to do more rock scrambling across large, slanted granite slabs and some nice views. Also talked to an ATC Ridge Runner who is like a park ranger for the trail and saw the memorial to WW 2 hero Audie Murphy. Dragons Tooth is consists of tall vertical slabs of granite and you can climb all over them. At 4 Pines Hostel we were met by dogs, cats, chickens and guinea fowl. Natureboi (who works there) took hiker Disciple and me to a local gas station for a very good cheeseburger plus some things for breakfast. Natureboi gave us the rules of this donation-based hostel which included shower but no towels (luckily my 12” x 12” camp towel managed) and for the guys “hang your hose out” which means guys use the outdoors not the toilet when possible.","Niday Shelter

Quickly shed my raincoat on the first big incline and decided I’d rather be wet from rain than hot and sweaty from my raincoat. Even with the rain the parking lot for McAfee Knob was crowded but it is one of the most photographed spots on the AT but once we got up there we could see why. Even with cloudy conditions it is a beautiful backdrop of the area.  Tinker Cliffs, the final stop of the Triple Crown, was socked in by weather but still worth seeing. We made it fairly early to 
Laurel Meadows Shelter and met up with Disciple on the way there. At the shelter were Nowhere & Meadows plus 2 people in hammocks and another 3 or 4 in tents.","4 Pines Hostel

Packerbacker, Disciple and I made good time and had good conversations along the way. Packerbacker dropped Disciple and I off on the his way back to Georgia which was definitely appreciated. After a quick shower and starting a load of dirty/wet laundry we headed to Cracker Barrel for pot roast.

Again “the trail provides” and I connected with great hiking partners, got my trail legs (this section had 46K feet of ascents & 48K feet of descents- not something we can train for when you come here from the Midwest), trail magic from Fresh Grounds and his Leapfrog Cafe), southern hospitality from hostels, hotels, shuttle drivers, local AT clubs and fellow hikers.
