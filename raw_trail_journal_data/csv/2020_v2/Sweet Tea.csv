Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600194,"Hey Y'all,
Just wanted to share with you my start  date for my 2019 Appalachian Trail thru hike. After careful consideration, I have decided to leave on February 1, 2019. Many of you are probably thinking ""Thats crazy leaving that early!"" and your right it is. Last year, I attempted to hike the Appalachian Trail. I left on January 30th. It was cold but not frigid. I ended up getting off at Woody gap for a knee injury. Turns out straining all the tendons in your knee is pretty painful carrying 30 lbs of gear up and down mountains. I'm pretty confident with my winter gear so i'm not worried about the weather. But why am I leaving so early? Well, I don't want to leave on the same day with dozens of other hikers. Y'all are probably aware that the Appalachian Trail at the southern terminus gets pretty busy in March and April. Heck, even at the end of February there are a lot of hikers jumping off. I feel with a start date of Feb 1, I won't be around so many hikers. With that being said, I'm sure I'll meet some other crazy people starting the same day I do.",,View Entry,"Aug 10, Fri",0

Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600703,"Hey Y'all!So for the last couple of days I have been thinking about switching my sleeping bag to a quilt. My current sleeping bag is a Kelty Cosmic Down 20 degree circa 2012. I had already planned on buying a new sleeping bag since mine doesn't have the loft or the warmth anymore. I have been looking at sleeping bags but I have noticed a lot of thru-hikers are now using quilts. This got me thinking. Are quilts better than the traditional sleeping bags? My biggest question is how they work in cold weather? Since I am starting the first day of February, I know that I will most likely see some pretty cold weather. Especially in the higher elevations in the Smokys. I like how a quilt can be very versatile. You can roll up in it or use it has a massive cover. Heck, if your sitting around the campfire and are a little cold, just wrap that sucker around ya. I can buy a quality quilt for cheaper than some quality sleeping bags. I'll spend the money for good gear but if a quilt is the way to go then... I guess I have some thinking to do. Good thing is I have 166 days to do so!Till next time",,View Entry,"Aug 18, Sat",0
Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606150,"Well y'all, I am 32 days away from stepping off at Springer. Sorry I haven't posted in a while. I haven't had much time between work and other things i've had to do recently. I've got everything together though,  except for a pair of trail runners. I plan on heading up to REI this week and pick a pair up. I have been wearing boots since I started hiking but I want something a little lighter and something that dries a heck of a lot quicker. My boots used to dry somewhat fast, until I decided one day like an idiot to waterproof them! They work great until the insides get wet. My last hurtle is to do a few extended shakedown hikes in January to make sure my knee doesn't give me to much trouble (not sure if I mentioned I messed my knee up attempting a thru hike last year). I haven't tried any overnight trips on it since I injured it last year on the trail. My knee has felt good on the day hikes I have done recently but that's just hiking on it for one day. I'm confident that the workouts I've done has helped strengthen my knee enough to begin my hike. So what's my plan? well, in short, my plan is to start at Springer instead of hiking the approach trail. I've done the approach 2 1/2 times. Twice up and once down. Non were much fun! The first is a story all its own. I'll let y'all here it one day. Anyway, I plan on starting at Springer from the parking lot on USFS 42. Its a mile up and a mile back down. I plan on going all the way to Hawk Mt. shelter my first day. I have a rough itinerary planned out up until Hot Springs. But as you all are aware im sure, nothing ever goes according to plan. If it did we would all have one that billion dollar powerball ticket! Y'all don't forget to subscribe to my Youtube channel Adventures of sweet tea. My gear video should be up in the next few weeks.",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Sun",0
Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606273,"So Friday the 4th I went up to Woody Gap to do a shakedown hike. I knew starting out that it was gonna be a nasty mess. For a while now Georgia has been getting rain a good bit. I decided to go anyway because I hadn't had an opportunity to try out my rain gear. I set out about 0900 hiking south in the clouds. At first, all I had on was my rain jacket since it really wasn't raining hard. It was mainly the water being blown off the trees that was falling. I made it to gooch mt. shelter for lunch and as soon as I got inside the bottom fell out! It was coming down good and I was glad I  had a dry place to eat. While I was there, two hikers came up and ate lunch as well. I can't remember their names but they were doing a section from Springer Mt. to Hot Springs, NC to raise money for the victims of hurricane Florence. As I got ready to continue my trek I stop at Blackwell creek to fill up. That's when I had my first failure. I use a Sawyer Squeeze (The full size of course) to filter my water. When I screwed it to my water bottle I over tightened it (like a dummy) and messed the rubber gasket up. I had no other way to filter water and since it had been raining so much recently I didn't trust the water to be safe without being filtered. So I had to change my plan of an overnight trip to a day hike. I continued south to justus creek where I turned around and started heading back to Woody Gap. I ended up hiking 12 miles in the rain which wasn't bad. I enjoyed it though. There's something about the woods when it's raining.  The only other gear failure I had was my rain jacket. My old Columbia just ain't waterproof no more. I kind of knew that before I started but I didn't know how bad it really would be. So instead of my Columbia, i'll be using the frogg togg jacket that came with my rain pants instead.",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Sun",0
Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606441,"Went up to my local REI yesterday to do something I had been wanting to do for a while. Buy a pair of Trail Runners! I've always worn traditional boots while hiking. Mainly because I thought that was the only way to do it safely. I'd rather have support and faith in a boot than a shoe. But after I hurt my knee I noticed that the weight of my boots would cause my knee to start hurting quicker. So I went and got some trail runners. I Tried on the Altra lone peak 4's and a pair of brooks cascadia 13's. I liked the way the Altras felt in the toe box but I didn't like the zero drop. Since none of my shoes have a zero drop, I was afraid the switch might cause some issues being this close to my start date. The brooks felt the best when I was walking around. I'm going to a local park tomorrow with a full pack to see how they do. Who knows, after these wear out I might try some Altra's",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Wed",0
Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606751,I start my thru hike FEB 3RD! I was gonna start tomorrow Feb 1 but I have a few things i need to take care of first. Like spending time with my family before I head out. Sunday my parents will drop me off at Nimblewill Gap and I will start my hike. I will post the day of to let you know I started.,,View Entry,"Jan 31, Thu",0
Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606779,I set out tomorrow on my adventure of a lifetime! I don't know if i'll be able to post anything Tomorrow due to the unknown cell reception but the plan is to start at Nimblewill Gap and hike to either stover creek shelter or long creek falls. Depending on the weather. I will try to Post as much as possible when reception permits. Thank y'all for all your words of encouragement so far. It really means a lot. See you on the trail!,,View Entry,"Feb 02, Sat",0
Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606861,Day 1: Daddy dropped me off this morning at Nimblewill Gap road. I was pretty happy when he said he would walk with me for a while. He turned around and left me right after black gap shelter. The trail was in good condition considering all the rain we’ve had recently. Only encountered 3 blow downs that caused the trail to be rerouted. I ate lunch at springer mountain parking lot. I wasn’t even on the trail for 6 hrs and already had my first trail magic. While I was packing up after lunch a f-150 pulled into the parking lot. It was a family of locals I imagine because they asked me if I was Thru hiking. I said yes and the wife handed her daughter 2 gum balls to give me. I haven’t chewed them yet. Gonna wait for a rainy day. I’m camping at hawk mt campsite tonight. Didn’t want to go this far today but it was to early in the day to stop anywhere. I plan on making it to gooch mt shelter tomorrow. Might try to start my vlog too!,"Nimblewill Gap

Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606865,"I started at hawk mountain campsite this morning. Hiked to hawk mountain shelter to get water and to use the privy. I ate lunch in the sun on top of sassafras mountain. As I got over sassafras mountain and got down to cooper gap, The ranger training battalion out of camp Merrill were dropping a water buffalo off. I was happy about this because I was out of water. For those of you who don’t know what a water buffalo is, it’s a portable water tank. I don’t know if that’s their official name but that’s what I’ve always heard them called. I’m camped tonight at gooch mountain shelter. Tomorrow I’ll plan on trying to make woods hole shelter. Don’t know if that’ll happen. My knee is acting up again.","Hawk mountain campsite

Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630092,Didn't sleep to good last night. The Rangers from camp Merrell were out and about all night long. Must be honing in there nighttime maneuvering. The hike up to Woody gap was just as I remembered all the other times. Water is flowing good everywhere. Had lunch with two section hikers and a thru hiker at woody gap. Good group of guys. Filled up at the water source right at woody. Saw a water snake suning in front of me as I was filtering. I just said hello and continued my filtering. He wasn't too friendly just stared at me Haha. Made it to woods hole shelter for the night. Looks like i'm gonna be alone. I have a gorgeous view of the sunset tonight. To bad I'm gonna be waking up to rain.,"Gooch mountain shelter

Ate lunch in the rain. And to top it all off, I made camp in the rain. Not too much to talk about today. Staying at Whitley gap Shelter with 2 guys just up for an overnight. Water source is great but the hike down to the shelter is long and steep. Im staying in my tent tonight. everything is damp so this is gonna be fun.","Woods Hole Shelter

Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630094,So after deciding last night that hiking alone is not for me and wrestling with the idea all night long I decided to come home. I got picked up at Unicoi Gap. It was a beautiful day hiking. I'm just gonna section hike until I complete the trail. Stay tuned for more updates.Keep hiking Y'all!,"Whitley Gap Shelter

Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626222,"February 2019 was gonna be the year I would thru hike the Appalachian Trail. An attempt the year before ended with me being laid up with both knees blown out for most of the year. After learning from my mistakes and preparing even better, I set out on my 2019 Appalachian Trail thru hike. My body was fine, my gear worked great, the only thing that gave me troubles was my mind. I stayed out on the trail for 5 days. I made it all the way to Unicoi Gap before I called to be picked up. For the longest time I wanted to thru hike the AT. But after having everything finally go right I realized that this adventure is not something I want to do alone. Sure you can meet people out on the trail, But for me it wouldn't of been the same. So with that being said I have a new plan. I plan on finishing the appalachian trail be doing sections hikes. My goal is for me to finish within this decade. I plan on starting at the furthest point I have reached thus far. Wallace Gap in North Carolina. I will be posting all my adventures on here until I nip this trail in the butt! Now if I can just find someone to do it with me!",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Sat",0
Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626341,"Getting this show on the road. This section hike thing at least. Oh it has been too long since i've been on the trail. Well since i've done a multi day hike. I'll be heading to North Carolina to pick up where my best friend and I ended. Wallace Gap. I haven't been on the trail in NC since 2012. My goal is to drive to the NOC, leave my truck, and be shuttled to Wallace Gap. The trip will be around 31 miles in total over 3 days from Feb 28-Mar 1. I plan to stay at the shelters. I always like to stay near the shelters that way I can read the trail journals. I hope I can run into some 2020 thru hikers while out there. I'd like to see how they are holding up after their trek through Georgia. Being from North Georgia has afforded me the ability to hike the Georgia section in its entirety 4 times. I know first hand how strenuous it is. Especially those who have never done it!

Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630090,"Woke up early so I could drive up to the NOC. Drive was pleasant. stopped in Franklin and got some breakfast at the Mickey D's. Mrs. Beverly Carini shuttled me back to Wallace Gap. Sweet lady. I strongly suggest using her if you are ever up this way and need a shuttle. Started hiking around 0900. Once you start there is a great water source. About two miles or so in it started spitting snow. Nothing big just small flakes and ice pellets. Trail is in good condition. Once I made it across Winding Stair gap the snow started picking up a little more. The Hike up to Siler bald wasn't that bad. The snow just made things a little harder. By the time I got to Wayah Bald, the snow was already a good 4-5 inches deep. I stopped and took a few pictures of the fire tower. It was extremely foggy so you couldn't see anything from the top. Stopped for water at mile 119.2 to fill up and take a short break before stopping at Wayah Bald Shelter for the night. Ran into a group of high schoolers at Winding Stair doing trail maintenance. Other than that I didn't run into anyone else until I got to the shelter. I had planned on staying in the shelter due to the snow but when I got there the shelter was already filled up by thru hikers and a few section hikers going from Springer to Hot Springs. I found a nice flat spot not far from the trail. Had to move about six inches of snow so I could set my tent up. The shelter is really nice though. Its a nantahala style shelter, similar to Carter Gap shelter. sleeps Six I Believe. Water source is nice too. Its not a bad hike to it but when there is snow on the ground it is! Had some Mashed potatoes for supper and some jerky. Gonna light my UCO candle lantern and turn in. Update tomorrow.","Wallace Gap

Sweet Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630091,"Got up Early. It got cold last night! Snowed all night. I think we got another 2 inches. I set my tent up under a tree and all night long ice kept falling and hitting it. I likened it to an acorn hitting a metal roof! It was a high mileage day with a ton of snow for most of it. Some sides of mountains had drifts 3 feet deep! hard to see the trail at some points. Wesser Bald had some breathtaking views on top the old fire tower. Was hesitant to climb it since I'm afraid of heights but i'm glad I did. Had lunch at the jump off and met a couple spending the night at A Rufus Morgan Shelter on the way down. NOC was pretty busy with people stopping and looking around. nothing much was open though.
