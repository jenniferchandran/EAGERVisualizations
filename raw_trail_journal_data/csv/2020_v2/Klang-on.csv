Gives me a map view and an elevation view.  It has a GPS function that shows where I’m at, with my phone in airplane mode.2.  AWOL Guide - actually named the Appalachian Trail Guide, but known by the trail name of the person who created it.  I have a paper version (also comes in a pdf file) and it also has a map and trail information like Guthooks.  I use it primarily for town information and as a backup to Guthooks.3.  Compass - in case I need to know which direction I’m headed and in an emergency.4.  Blazes marking the trail - I’ll cover this as a separate topic in a future post.Obviously I don’t want to get lost, go the wrong way on the AT, or go on the wrong trail, so these tools are important.  Not to mention other critical things like the next water source- I’ll cover this in a future post as well.","Windsor Furnace Shelter

My daily target is 12 miles.  This enables me to take the equivalent of one zero per week and still hit my overall daily 10 mile goal.Weather is a factor - it’s pouring rain right now!  What’s the temperature and humidity?  Today it only got up to about 80 but it was very humid.  Pack weight including food and waterWater availabilityHow I feel and any soreness,etc.  I’m nursing a blister on one of my toes that I don’t want to get worse.  My knees are sore at times, mostly in the evening when I’m trying to sleep.The destination itself - is it a shelter or campsite?  Trail difficulty- how much ups and downs are there?  How many feet up and down?  Today near the start of my hike, I had an 800’ climb over a mile and a half.If I’ve got a scheduled rendezvous with relatives like when I met my cousins, daughter and her boyfriend.So in summary there are many factors that go into how far I will hike and to which destination.  Keep Klangin’ On!","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

The easy part are the physical aspects.  I think I’ve lost about 20 pounds while building my leg muscles.  As I heard one description of thru hikers, we are like T-Rexes with strong legs and weak arms!  Although using hiking poles strengthens some arm muscles.  Mentally I’m changing to be more adaptable.  A lot of rolling with unexpected punches.  Separate theme for that one!  More self-reliant.  Hike Your Own Hike can include doing what’s best for me to be safe and successful.  More tolerant of differences in people and their personalities and behaviors.  More confident - “I can do this!”  And there’s probably more which I’ll include in a later post!
