G,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625626,"I have thought about attempting to thru hike the AT for a while.  On my first hike on the AT starting at Springer in 2010, I ran into a bunch of southbounders just about finished at Hawk Mountain shelter.  Although in decent spirits, they looked just awful.  Emaciated, scraggly, dirty and I just couldn't believe they were enjoying themselves.  I finished my section hike and felt great, like I really accomplished something but there was no way I would ever try a thru.  After more sections and other trails, the idea of a thru hike started to creep in.  I kept thinking about the challenge and sense of accomplishment those south bounders must have had when they did indeed finish and maybe I could give this a shot.  But first I needed to retire.  I had been thinking about leaving work for a while.  While I like the people I work with, and the work had been good for many years, the last few years had been wearing on me.  Finally, about a year ago I decided I had enough; I would retire in 2020 and attempt to thru hike the AT northbound while I am still physically able to do so.  Hopefully while hiking I will figure out what to do when done with the AT.  Most people that hear my plan think I am crazy.  Others seem happy for me and ask some good questions, are supportive and curious.  Fortunately my wife (Krispy) is supportive and that is all that matters.So here I am.  Retiring in February then heading out in March.I have been working out, walking a lot, started walking with a loaded pack and feeling pretty good.  But Florida is not a very mountainous area but it will have to do.",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Mon",0
G,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625825,"3 more weeks (minus Fridays) of work to go.  It is now dragging and that date and starting to hike can't get here fast enough.  I think I have most things in place to be able to leave for 5 or 6 months.  A few things to go so my wife will not have to deal with most of the house and yard things I take care of.  Still exercising whenever possible.  Will take a longer walk with the pack tomorrow.One of my concerns was being cold at the start in early March.  I have a 30 degree WM bag and did not realize the temperature rating was survival vs. comfort.  Ended up getting a new 0 degree Hike and Byke bag.  Never heard of them but it got glowing reviews.  We may be getting a frosty cold 40 degree night next week so I may sleep in the tent in the back yard and see how it feels.  Otherwise, I think the gear is all in place and ready to go.  Next task is working on the food for the first few days.  Plan to try a few of the energy bars and similar snacks and if I find something I like I will get a few weeks worth.  Same with drink mixes.  Meals will be on the fly with whatever is available in towns.That's all for now.G",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Thu",0
G,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626012,"One week of work to go. Really only 4 days as Fridays are off every other week. Folks at work have been interested much more about my hike recently. The questions have been much more on the curious side rather than about bears, finally.  How far, food, sleep, etc. After my last day we’ll go out to a local brewery and enjoy some beer. I’ll miss the people much more than the work. 
Been trying to walk some with a loaded pack every day. This week someone posted on FB about the shady character in the neighborhood who looked like he was ready to camp in someone’s back yard. After a while I posted I thought they were right and tried to have some fun with it. I guessed it would take 1 or 2 walks until someone posted but they disappointed me and I made it 3 weeks. 
Gear is dialed in, just working food now and maybe 3 mail drops. Thinking Fontana to get through the Smokies, somewhere in VA, and NH. More than that seems like to much planning. 
Just a few weeks to go.G",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Thu",0
G,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626118,"Retirement, check.  Retirement Happy Hour with co-workers, check.  Retirement Party with everyone, check.  All were great and I appreciate everyone coming out, the gifts (you weren’t supposed to bring) and the good times.  Now it’s on to more walking and more time at the gym.
As more people learn about my intent to hike the Appalachian Trail (AT) I have been getting a lot of questions.  So, I will attempt to answer some of them now for the readers.  There are a lot more and I will add an entry in the future with more Q/A.
The most common question is ‘Are you going alone?’ The answer to this is yes and no.  I am starting by myself but there will be many, many others at the start of the AT and for the first few weeks.  People tend to congregate around the shelters that are spaced about every 8 to 10 miles.  A normal day would be like the back and forth of an accordion.  As I get further up the trail, the crowds will thin a bit as people drop out and get more space between them due to hiking pace or going into towns.
‘How do you carry that much food?’ or ‘How do you get food?’  No, I do not carry 150 days worth of food.  There are towns about every 3 to 7 days, on or a short ways off the trail.  Find a way into town and resupply food and what ever other items are needed.  The locals in these towns are used to seeing hikers and for the most part welcome them (as long as they behave).  Hitch hiking is very common in these small towns and Trail Angels (folks that help hikers out with any number of things) or hostels also provide rides.
‘Where do you get water?’ or ‘How can you carry that much water?’  I will carry a water filter. It is a Saywer Sqeeze.  It is a small bag that attaches to a filter.  Fill the bag in the creek, attach to the filter, squeeze the bag to force the dirty (not always) water through the filter and into a bottle.  It is very easy but a bit time consuming.  I have used the Saywer Mini and liked it.  I will try a regular size Saywer next as I read it is a little faster.  There are creeks and piped springs all along the trail.  For the most part, getting water is not an issue except in PA and/or if there is a drought.  I usually carry 2 liters of water but if it gets really dry, I would carry more.  There are also pump filters that are heavier but you can pull water out of a mud puddle if needed.
‘Of course you’ll take deodorant, won’t you? (insert funny look)’ No.  Hikers stink.  Bad.  That’s just the way it is.  I don’t want to carry it anyways.  When I go into town and stay at a motel, I will get a shower.  There are hostels that you can pay for a shower or clean your clothes at as well. On my first hike that was 5 days, my wife and kids picked me up at the end.  We had to leave the windows open because the stench was a bit overwhelming.
‘What do you do if it rains?’ Hike on.  A saying in the hiker community is “No Rain, No Pain, No Maine.”  I have rain gear and I will get wet.  The SE USA is very wet and rainy in the spring.  How else would you get those May flowers?  Shoes and socks will be wet and may freeze in the cold.  Just keep moving to stay warm and wait for a sunny day to dry things out.
That’s enough for now.  One month to go.",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Sun",0
G,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626260,"This past weekend I got a chance to visit my kids at college and we had a good time with them and their friends.  Also saw my parents and my mother-in-law.  Taking care of the last few gear items via Amazon.  The tips and ideas that can be found on the Internet and particularly the FB hiking groups are great but can be a bit much.  I have to just go with what works for me.  Will pack up a few resupply boxes this week for my wife to send later.  Otherwise it is time to hike.
I continue to walk around the area as much as possible.  Had an interesting situation today.  While walking on a not very busy single lane road that is 45 MPH, a large SUV was coming at me and another car coming in the opposite direction from behind.  I was walking against the flow of traffic, as I am supposed to, so I can see what’s coming.  The guy coming towards me did not slow down at all and did not move towards the center of the road at all.  I saw it coming the whole way so was not worried about getting hit as I could get out of the way if needed.  I gave him a nasty glare as he went by.  He then proceeded to stop, back up and confront me about why I did not jump out of HIS way because he had nowhere on the road to go.  He was pissed.  Unlike me, I calmly said I had the right of way as the pedestrian on the very narrow shoulder when there is no sidewalk. He let out a few choice words, which, I let go.  Usually I would let him have it right back but I could tell immediately I was not going to reason with stupid.  He wanted to know what he was supposed to do.  I said slow down a little and let the other guy pass first. WHOA!!!!  Slow down?  You’re kidding, right.  He was important and clearly had somewhere to be.  I’m ready to get on a trail where 3 MPH is speeding.  BTW, I looked up the pedestrian law in Florida and I was correct that, as the pedestrian, and no sidewalk, I am to keep to the far left of the shoulder.

Did the long drive from FL up to Amicalola Falls State Park (AFSP).  Arrived about 4pm. Worked with Nick to get checked in and the pack weighed. A bit heavy at 30# but that should go down quick as the food disappears. I am thru hiker #868 for 2020 Northbounders (NOBO). Nick also gave myself and a hiking couple a short overview about some do’s and don’ts when on the trail. I knew most of it but it was good to hear it again. I then headed under the arch and up the 600 stairs. This was without the pack which Krispy took to the top in the car.  Dinner at Spirits Tavern in Dahlonega and a Murphy’s at Shenanigans. Both places were good.

After a slow start in Dahlonega I got to the top of the falls just before 10. Of course it was raining but not too bad. It did make me hurry and that was a problem. I forgot to get things moved to their proper places and later I realized they were wet. Oh well. The hike was nice and not to hard the on the approach trail. Got to Black Gap shelter at about noon. Took a short break for a snack. I really need to take the time to do that in the early going as it takes a while to get the hiker hunger. 
After the break, the rain mostly stopped and just the fog and drip from the trees got me. Made the summit of Springer in short time. Again, nothing to see in the fog. Got a few photos, signed the log book and moved on. 
After Springer the trail got very muddy. Shoes and pants are a mess but will dry. Got to Stover Creek shelter at about 330 and got a spot upstairs. Even though not hungry I did eat a Mountain House meal which was pretty good. The rain started again at about 630 so I am glad I am not in the tent. I suspect when it gets dark everyone will tun in. It’s not cold tonight so don’t need to worry about things freezing.

Great but tough day. It rained off and on over night but I stayed in the shelter so it was not an issue. With daylight savings time it doesn’t get light in the woods until about 8. Ate some oatmeal, stuffed some snacks in my pockets and headed out. The first few miles were real easy and slightly downhill. After a short climb at about 5 miles I got to Hawk Mountain shelter. Went there for a snack and rest. Upon leaving the shelter and getting on the trail I was met by a group of army rangers doing a training exercise. About 5 minutes later some mortars went off not far away. Then there was a second group of rangers. Now I was between the two “warring” groups. I just kept going. Then, 10 minutes later all kinds of shooting was happening. It was all good as this is commonplace and they fire blanks (I hope). 
The rest of the day was steep ups and downs with Sassafras Mountain being the biggest by far. Rolled into a packed campsite at about 430. Found a tent site, got set up, ate and am ready for bed. The weather today was perfect; 50s, some clouds and minimal wind. There is a chance of rain tonight so the tent may be challenging in the morning.

G,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626873,"Mar 12 - Gooch Gap shelter to Neel Gap (15.6 miles)
A very long, hard, but rewarding day. But first, last night at about 8 the rain did arrive with lightening and thunder. The funny thing is in the mountains at 3000 ft it feels like the thunder is literally on top of you. It is not like FL thunder at all. That storm ended by 10 and then the moon was out and bright. Later it rained lightly some more. I didn’t sleep well again and I think my sleeping pad is the culprit. I am a side sleeper and the pad is thin, to save weight. Just not gonna work.
Since I was awake at 6 and knew if I wanted to make my further possible destination if possible I needed to get going. Also, 2 other factors affected today’s decisions. First, with about 40 people at this shelter site, a good number of them would want to stop at my first possible stopping point. That site only has room for 4-6 tents. The second issue is that shortly after that site there is no camping for 5 miles without a hard sided bear canister which I don’t have. So, I decided to get to the first campsite, Lance Creek, see what time I get there, then decide whether to press on or set up. And, oh by the way, if you have never packed up a wet tent I the dark morning, you really are missing out. But I got all packed up and was hiking by 650 with headlamp on. It was very foggy, almost like a mist. The trail was fairly tame for the first 5 miles and I got to Woody Gap before 10. Had a snack, emptied my garbage and made use of the toilets. After the gap things get tougher as the trail climbs about 500 feet rather quickly to the top of Big Cedar Mountain. There would be long range views if not for the fog. Then it’s a long down to the previously mentioned Lance Creek campsite. I got there about noon. It was now decision time. Stay here, ahead of the previous night’s crowd, and talk to myself in the rain for 8 hours. Or, eat a quick snack, top off my water and move on and try to make it to Neel Gap. Then, while looking at my guide, I saw some comments about a B&B that would pick me up at Neel Gap, give me dinner, wash my nasty wet clothes, give me breakfast, and return me to the trail. That is not a hard decision. I was able to call them and get a room reserved. Decision made; press on another very hard 7.1 miles. And as if a final sign was needed to confirm my choice it started pouring as I was packing up. 
The afternoon walking began at 1230 and is mostly up for about 4.8 miles to the highest point in GA on the AT, Blood Mountain. History lesson: I think it got the name because way back 2 Indian tribes fought there and so many were killed the mountain ran red with blood and the creek partway up is called Slaughter Creek. The up was tough but not excessively hard. Just long. At the top is an old stone shelter built in the 30s by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It’s cold, drafty and musty but relatively clean. 2 young guys I met were staying there tonight. I had a snack and pressed on. The down from Blood was hard, rocky and steep in places. Lots of large slabs that were slick on this wet day. Right at 5 I reached the road at Neel gap. And my ride to the  ‘Your Home in the Woods’ B&B. The owners are very nice and have a great place set up for hikers or tourists. 
Well, a longer entry than previous since I’m in a nice comfy chair. Plan to back it off a bit tomorrow and go only about 11 miles. I will also see if the outfitter right on trail has a sleeping pad I can get.
Until tomorrow.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

G,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626928,"Mar 13 - Neel Gap to Low Gap Shelter (11.6 miles)
The stay last night at the “Your Home in the Woods” B&B was excellent. I would recommend it to any future hikers. Paul and Bonnie had me back at the gap at 930, with some muffins for the hike.  I got the new sleeping pad so hopefully that helps. The start point at Neel Gap is an outfitter, hostel, tourist site and the only spot where the trail goes through a building. From Mountain Crossing it’s straight up from there for 700+ feet. The trail then rolled along the ridge line for about 4 miles until it dropped down to Tesnatee Gap. Now for a new term for the non-hikers; PUD (pointless up and down).  At Tesnatee Gap it went straight up for .6 miles then straight down to Hogpen Gap. So what’s different about this climb you ask?  A mountain highway runs between these 2 gaps and is about a quarter mile.  Why couldn’t the trail makers put the trail along the side of the mountain instead of straight over?  
From there it was pretty mild Trail to Low Gap. I am tented in the north suburbs far from the shelter, privy and water. There are at least 20+ tents up here plus many scattered on the path to the ‘city center’.
Talked to a lot more hikers today at camp but during the day it is mostly solo and leapfrogging other hikers. 
The weather was excellent today but (there is always) rain in the forecast. All in all a good day with shorter miles. May push to Tray Mtn shelter tomorrow but that would be tough.
Until tomorrow","Neel Gap

Got the new sleeping pad and it is much more comfortable. Unfortunately, in tent city last nite there was a guy coughing all night. Very annoying. Oh well. That allowed me to get up early and on the trail before 7. From Low Gap it’s a very mellow trail along an old logging roadbed. Eventually the trail climbed a bit towards Blue Mountain shelter. Arrived about 11 and forced down some lunch. Hiker hunger still has not shown up. 
After that was a long rocky downhill to Unicoi Gap and of course it started to rain. Not surprisingly it stopped raining when I got to the bottom. From there it is a long uphill to Rocky Mountain then down to Indian Grave Gap and a bigger uphill to Ttay Mountain. 
Ran into a trail maintainer working Rocky. Let her know the whole trail so far had been great. On the lower part of Tray I ran into a ridge runner. This is someone that ‘patrols’ the trail making sure the hikers know what’s what. Also got a bit of mini trail magic. A car was on the Tray Mountain service road while I was talking to the ridge runner and offered to take our trash. 
Overall it was a good day but very hard ending on such a large climb. Weather was good except for that one shower. 
I plan to do 11 miles and get into Hiawassee and resupply. Depending on the time, I will either get a room in town or try to get back to the trail.

One of the things about hiking the AT is the characters you encounter. At the shelter last night I met one of them. Barefoot (trail name) hikes the trail wearing?  If you didn’t guess no shoes we have a problem. I don’t get it but he says it’s great. Not for me, but if it works for him, more power to him. 
Today was foggy. I mean really foggy. Then in the afternoon it became more foggy. Then later .....you get the idea. No views at all. The big climb of the day was Kelly Knob (see picture-I don’t know if it will give the real steep perspective). 800 feet straight up with no switchbacks. Not horrible but tough. After that it was mostly downhill to Dick’s Creek Gap. This is a busy mountain road. At the gap I encountered my first trail magic. Trail magic is when you get something totally unexpected that helps your hike. Former through hikers were giving out food and drinks. I forgot how good Hostess cupcakes are. I did not get their names, but thanks. Then we struck up a conversation with Buttercup who gave us a ride to town (10 miles) for a few bucks for gas. 
I am now staying at the Hiawassee Budget Inn with Bilbo and Ginger. Good guys who I have been leapfrogging with for the past 2 days.  We resupplied at the Ingles, stopped at an outfitter, did laundry and ate/drank at the Hiawassee Brewery. 
My plan is to take the 9am shuttle provided by the motel (see, not that budget) back to the gap. I should enter state 2 (NC) around noon tomorrow. 
Until tomorrow.","Tray Mountain Shelter

G,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627023,"Mar 16 - Dick’s Creek Gap to Muskrat Creek Shelter (11.8 miles)
So the Budget Inn turned out to be OK for the price. Only $21 per person. I slept on the couch but slept pretty well.   The Inn provided a shuttle back to the gap at 9 so I was hiking by 930. As usual, fog, fog, and more fog. I do hope this weather lifts soon. Today was tough. The ups were long and some very steep while the downs tended to be very slick with mud. Passed and was passed by many of the same faces, including Bilbo, who shared the room last night.  Ginger from last night is zeroing today. That means no trail miles accomplished. Finally, around 1 I completed GA and entered NC. 1 state down and 13 to go. And, NC started out straight up; yay!
Completing GA was my first mini-goal so: check. Next goal is to get through the Smokies. This one may get hard, not due to me but external issues. It seems the C word (keep it clean on this family friendly blog) is now affecting the trail and resorts and resupply options are closing. This could very negatively affect me and all the hikers. Without resupply options the hike will be over. I will deal with this in 2 days when I get to Franklin. 
I made it to camp by about 4. It is busy here, mostly due to the distance from Hiawassee. The next shelter is 5.5 more miles so tough for most. I could make it but don’t need to. That’s how injuries happen. I do believe tomorrow could be a big day, possibly over 16 miles. 
Since not much interesting happened on trail today I’ll try to describe the camp arrival process. This is how I do things but everyone does this a little different. First, of course, determine where I will stay the night since this dictates when to have a snack or lunch. On arrival, see if there is room in the shelter. There usually is not during thru hiker season. Most shelters have spaces for tents, so find a favorable location. Flat, dry, no widow makers, and not where rain would run. Then set up the tent. Then place the sleeping pads (2 since I now have a thin foam and inflatable) inside the tent and the sleeping bag.  Then unpack the other contents of the pack and place them where I like them in the tent. Switch to Crocs to let the feet air out. Finally, take food bag, cook  pot and water back to the shelter to cook and eat. Clean up, brush teeth and tie up food. Since toothpaste is smelly, it goes in the food bag. The food bag is then closed off and either hung from a bear cable if it exists, placed in a bear locker if it exists, or tied to a tree. I am using an Usack Almighty bag with an Opsack odor liner so I don’t have to throw a bear bag to hang my food. Just tie it to a tree. The Ursacks seem to be popular probably because a bear line does not need to be strung. All of this including eating takes about 90 minutes.
The sun (that I can’t see) is setting so it is almost hiker midnight.
Until tomorrow.","Dick’s Creek Gap

Today was down then up then down. It started raining right after I finished yesterday’s entry and rained hard all night. I got some sleep but not very good. There was a lull in the rain at 645 so I got going as quick as possible. It’s bad enough breaking down a wet tent but a whole other thing doing that while it’s still raining. I scarfed down a protein bar and was off. My plan was to eat lunch at the next shelter, Standing Indian. It was only 5 miles. I was cruising because it was cold and rain was in the air. I got there just as the rains let loose. While there I ate and watched hiker after hiker come in totally soaked and cold. The story on the trail was that the rain would let up around noon. At about 1130 I had enough and got going. The rain did stop right about at noon as I reached the summit of Standing Indian Mountain at 5478ft, the tallest so far. 
Now it was decision time. If I hoof it at top speed I could get to Carter Gap Shelter in time to get a spot in the shelter and miss any overnight rain. If there was no room I could either camp there or press on to a marked campsite. So hoof it I did. And then a funny thing happened; the sun came out. I didn’t know what to do so I took some pictures and kept going. 
I arrived at the shelter at about 3 only to find the area was packed. I would not be staying. But I did take off my shoes and socks to dry while I sat on a log in the sun. This, however, is when things went awry because there was great cell coverage. One girl saw a letter from the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy - the keepers of all things AT) recommending that all thru and section hikers should discontinue their hikes due to risks associated with Coronavirus (it even comes up as a known word on my phone in Apple’s Word equivalent).  Not an edict to stop but pretty close coming from the ATC. We have already seen and heard about closures and resource limitations along the trail. With the towns getting smaller or nonexistent for the next 150+ miles, lack of resupply, motels and hostels closing, it makes little sense to continue my hike. I may make it to these small towns and get stuck as they don’t have Uber and other things we take for granted. Even private shuttlers are stopping driving. The struggle to get what I need combined with the uncertainty would take a lot of the fun out of it.  For me it sucks but I have it easy. I can come back in a week or a month or flip up to Maine in June or July. Most of the folks here have very limited funds and resources and may never get another opportunity. I’m disappointed for them. So, I spoke to Krispy who spoke to a friend of ours who lives in Franklin, NC. He graciously offered to pick me up at Winding Stair Gap, help me take care of the little things and get me to the Asheville airport. Thanks Jason. 
But, I still had to get to my destination for the night. It was an easy hike down to Betty Creek Gap. There are a bunch of hikers set up in the area. I found a spot, got set up, ate, and will soon be in bed. Even with the rain and decision to end the hike, it was a good day; I saw the sun and it was warm. I have a tough 12.2 mile hike tomorrow to get out. Maybe I’ll get really lucky and get views off of Albert Mountain fire tower. 
Until tomorrow. 
PS. If anyone wagered on how far I would get, you can’t get paid yet. To constitute a thru hike the whole trail just needs to be completed in a calendar year. And, as Mick Jagger says, time is on my side.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Last night was much drier than any past nights. Even the humidity was lower leaving the tent dry and easier to pack up. I ate a protein bar for breakfast and was off before 8. The first almost 3 miles are up but relatively gradual and uneventful. However, the final climb up to the fire tower on Albert Mountain is steep. Like in the 70+% grade range. In a few places I needed to use my hands to pull myself up. It was a tough fun, though. Once I got to the top, the clouds/fog was rolling in and there were no views. That’s unfortunate because it had been clear earlier. The views when clear would be 360 degrees and long range. Just after the summit I passed the 100 mile marker (twice, who knows why).
From there, it is a long gradual downhill all the way to Rock Gap. When I got there the Hiking Family (I think a couple and some number of kids that all hiked the trail in 2018) were giving out trail magic.  I had some Kool Aid while waiting for my corn dog with home made batter. I am not a corn dog fan but this thing was awesome. I also had some home made fried potatoes/chips that were excellent. I was the only hiker there as I had been moving pretty good all day. Thanks Hiking Family.
After that I took off and called Jason who was kind enough to get me, give me a place to sleep and take me to the Asheville airport in the morning. We had some pizza for dinner and vegged our. 
The decision to stop hiking now was tough and was on my mind all day. I want to keep going; I feel great, nothing hurts or is hurt, and I was really cruising today. But, the uncertainties about what will be available soon, potential impacts if I were to carry this virus into some tiny community and other factors make me believe it is the right choice. Hopefully this will clear up quickly and I can get back out there. 
BTW, tortillas are a very popular trail food that I only ever considered for Mexican food. I have to admit, everything I’ve put on them has been pretty good. So far, Havarti cheese and pepperoni, just pepperoni, and today was flavored tuna pack. Just ‘food’ for thought.

I read a lot of the FB posts from folks that are for or against leaving the trail.  You all need to simmer down. It is a hard decision and a personal one.  I know first hand as I just thought through this problem.  I understand that people have planned for years, saved up funds, put life on hold, etc. to make this happen.  There are others that feel the risks are to big for themselves and the small town communities that may get the infection from hikers and make matters worse.  You're both right and you're both wrong.  Just agree to disagree and move on while also thinking about the repercussions your decisions will have.  Ultimately, I hope, you will make the best decision for you and those around you.
I will monitor the situation and hope to get back on trail this year.  If not, the trail will be there in the future and hopefully, I will be healthy enough to try again.","Winding Stair Gap

Well, why not go out and do some time in the woods. Today was a long day. Up at 4am to catch the flight to Dulles. Then an Uber to Harpers Ferry. I was there by 1140, not too bad. I got some stove fuel, a snack and a Powerade for the walk. The trail goes through this tourist/historic town then crosses the Potomac River on a pedestrian bridge next to the railroad bridge. Now I was in Maryland on the Chesapeake & Ohio (C&O) tow path. This is a canal that was created long ago to move goods inland. I think boats or barges were in the canal and pulled by horses or mules that walked on this tow path. There were locks and other structures similar to today’s canals. This 3 miles of trail I’d dead flat. 
The trail then went over some roads and finally started to climb. It was a bit warm and the climb was harder than expected. This climb leads to Weaverton cliffs. This is a nice rock outcropping overlooking the Potomac River. It seemed to be a very popular place for locals to hike. From there the trail meandered with very little elevation gain or loss. My plan was to go to the Ed Garvey memorial shelter which was only a few more miles. Upon arrival at the shelter it was only 3 PM. There was no way I was going to sit around for three or four hours until night time. I decided to move on and go to Gathland State park where I would be able to fill up on water. This park seems to be related to Civil War history. It had some interesting information boards and other monuments.
After the park the trail gained some elevation for about a half an hour. After that things leveled out again nicely and I arrived at the Crampton Gap Shelter at approximately 5 PM. I set up camp, did the normal chores, ate a Mountain House meal of pasta and sauce with meat and got ready for bed. While writing this blog I hear owls hooting in the distance. At one point there was a strong smell of skunk but it disappeared quickly so perhaps it was only a fox.
Today’s distance was about 10.4 miles. The leaves are turning in this area but mostly yellows. Tomorrow I plan to go to the Dahlgren hiker campground to get water and shoot for a 15 to 18 mile day. The weather today was perfect with just some haze in the sky and the same for tomorrow.

Slept OK last night. I think I was in the tent so early it thru me off. But did get a few hours. Up about 630 to take care of business, break down camp and eat some instant oatmeal. I was walking at about 8. 
The trail today was mostly flat with only a couple of climbs and descents. Maryland is not really flat, just relative to other AT sections. That didn’t make things any easier as there were some very rocky sections. Stopped at the Dahlgren Backpacker Campground for lunch and top off all my water. This area is very dry with very few creeks or springs. I left with over 4 liters and it was heavy. 
Of course a climb followed. It was long but not too steep. Eventually I reached the original Washington Monument. Nice park and structure but nothing like that in DC. Next up was crossing over I-70. I could hear the highway for miles on either side. There is a shelter nearby but I don’t see how you could stay there.
Next up was Annapolis Cliffs. This is a nice rock outcrop with clear views to the west. It also had campsites but it was too early to stop.  Black Rock Cliffs was next and similar. From there it was about 2 miles to my camp at Pogo Memorial Campground. Not sure what’s special about it but it does have a privy and water. 
I set up camp, ate a meal then got water. The water turned into an adventure. Comments in my guide say to go past the first water to a better source. I didn’t see the first dry source right by the trail. So down I went and got to the second source that I thought was the first. That one would have been tough since there was not much. I kept going and going and....   you get the idea, nothing. So back and up I went. I did find a better place to get water but it was a long down and up. 
I am now typing this and the insects are making lots of noise. Dark is 7pm right now. Also, there must be a lake with speedboats or a drag strip near by because every 30 seconds or so something goes full throttle and is loud.

That dang dragstrip was going last night until at least 11 o’clock and it was loud. I could hear that for half the day today it was very annoying. Was up around 630 again. Didn’t sleep that well but did get a couple hours again. Got camp chores done and everything packed away ready to head out at 8 o’clock. Since I got water last night I did not need to deal with that this morning. The trail from the campground was a gradual up for a few miles this morning. At that point things leveled off and it went along the ridge line for a few more miles.Overall the trail was good but there were some extremely rocky areas in this section and it’s very slow going when this happens. Views were lvery limited today And that can make the going slower. It’s helps to get a nice view every so often to stay motivated for the reward. Luckily today was quite cool maybe reaching the high 50s. Great hiking weather  
Eventually I got to an area with a brand new shelter. It was about lunchtime so I decided to go in and check out the shelter and eat something for lunch. When I got there there was a guy and a girl and the girl was reading a book to the guy that seemed to be about fifth grade level. Not a big deal but a little bit odd. I moved my water between bottles to make it more accessible at which point the guy pulled out his machete and started sharpening it. Alarm bells started going off, justified or not. I decided to pack up and move on rather than take a chance that this was not an innocent move on his part. Better to be safe than sorry. But I ended up skipping lunch.
After that I got to an area called high rocks, probably because the rocks are up high. I’ve seen enough views now to the west that I decided to skip the main trail out to the rocks, however, there was an area further down the main trail next to the rocks so I climbed up and took a look. It was a nice view but I’m glad I didn’t spend a quarter-mile to go out to the main area. After that most of the trail was downhill, and it was rocky, very rocky.
I passed a lot of the hikers and longer distance hikers today but they were all going southbound. A few were willing to chat but most just pressed on. Must be a COVID thing  
Around 315 I got to the Pen Mar park. This area has pavilions, bathrooms, water, and other things a hiker needs. It also had a good view, again to the west. Since I didn’t eat lunch earlier I decided to cook my dinner. This is convenient because then I can refill all of my water containers. When finished, I packed up and headed the last 8/10 of a mile to the Falls Creek area which has camp areas. I am now set up and ready for the night. We’re are supposed to get very cold tonight possibly down as low as 35. However, this area seems to be a little bit warmer than it was back at the park.
Tomorrow’s plan is to possibly go as far as 18 miles which sets me up to stay at another civilized campground as well as get dinner at a restaurant very close to the trail.

Today was long and tough but very rewarding. Fitful sleeping for most of the night as it was very cold. I looked at my phone at 440 and poof, it was 7. I was planning a long day so packed up without eating and set off. The plan showed 2 climbs today; one to start and a long one later. The first looked steep in my guide but wasn’t that bad. It then led right back down. Then it was a long gradual climb onto the ridge for a few miles. I eventually got to Old Forge park that had a water spigot to top off my water. 
From the park it was the second climb of the day that was 1100 feet over 3 miles.  Once at the top the trail skirted along the very rocky ridge line. The rocks were sharp in many place and took a toll on my feet. Also, the leaves are falling off the trees obscuring the trail. After 15 miles the trail dropped down to a highway. About 1/4 mile west was a burger place so I rewarded myself with dinner. I was talking to a couple of guys that I had been leapfrogging with and they convinced me to go to the next shelter instead of stopping at the state campground. Sure, why not. That led to big climb 3 of the day. The shelter is very nice. 2 rooms with a common area in the middle. I am on a tent platform and was going to cowboy camp but it’s too cold so I set up my tent. Quite the crew here with a big fire, bourbon (I passed) and a festive mood. A long but good day. 
Tomorrow looks pretty flat (AT relatively speaking) and I hope to get to Pine Grove Furnace state park.

The conversation at the shelter went on past 10 with a raging fire. All good guys there. I was going to cowboy camp but by 9 it was just too cold so I set up my tent on a platform. I stayed pretty warm although my feet were a bit cold. Up by 7, ate, and was walking at 815. 
Today was about the smoothest grade I have been on on the AT. There were ‘smooth’ sections sometimes for miles. There were rocky sections but nothing like yesterday’s Boulder hopping. 
At one point I hit a service road an 2 Amish buggies and an Amish girl on a bike were there. Seemed odd to see that, but I guess this is Amish Country. At about 11 I stopped at a shelter and had lunch of tortillas and tuna. Not bad. I made a point of eating a protein bar when I felt my energy lagging. No views at all today but the foliage is bright  
After about 15 miles I popped out on a forest service road with a board with maps. There was also a poster about a 13 year old girl who was abducted in August. She was taken by a man and traveling on the AT in this area. For those of you that read my entry from 2 days ago you probably see where I am going with this. So, when I got cell service I called the number and spoke to the dispatcher. He said the girl was found ok. But he suggested he transfer me to the PA State Trooper barracks to explain what I saw. I spoke to that guy but he did not know anything about the AT area or any girls missing. He said to call 911. I am hesitant to do that and cause a whole brouhaha. I may though just to explain what I saw. The guy never threatened me but the whole situation was off. 
By this point my feet were really starting to hurt. Yesterday’s 20 plus today’s 17, and all the rocks are taking a toll. I arrived into Pine Furnace park area at about 4. The thru hiking tradition is that since this is just a few miles past the trail’s halfway point, you’re supposed to eat a half gallon of ice cream. Since I have only done 10% I took the 10% challenge: I succeeded. 
It’s getting cold again. I have 3 options for the night. Continue on 3 miles to an unmarked campsite.  Camp at a spot in the campground that’s part of the Pine Grove park, or get a bunk in the adjoining hostel. The hostel won and is cheaper than tenting in the campground. Then to top it off, I appear to be the only person staying in the 16 person bunk room. 
Since I am a bit ahead of schedule for my pickup, I plan (we’ll see) to slow down tomorrow and camp before Boiling Springs, PA.

The hostel worked out well. No one else showed up at the Hostel so I had the whole bunk room to myself. I slept pretty well. I also got a shower which was nice because the funk was starting to kick in. In the morning we are allowed to take whatever we want from the refrigerator. However, that food in there looked old and unappetizing. I grabbed a protein bar from my bag and headed out the door at about 745. The trail from there follows through the park for about a mile and a half. It then turns up and heads for the ridge line as usual.The climb itself was not very bad. It then traversed the Ridgeline with no views whatsoever from within the trees. The trail was not very steep up or down but was very rocky throughout today. Yesterday evening I noticed a couple of blisters forming but by morning today they were pretty much gone. I did tape up my feet with duct tape to help prevent more blisters.As the day went on today I noticed blister type pain in the same area of my left foot. I thought it was the same blister reappearing.  It wasn’t. It turns out to be a new one right where the duct tape edge was. I need to work on that better for tomorrow.
The trail today let out at a road where a local deli exists. It’s just a 10th of a mile up the street. I went in and got a large, and I do mean large, Italian sub. It was pretty good. I also got a Gatorade, some cookies, and some meat snacks to take with me. 
Of course when leaving a road the trail goes up. So up I went again reaching the ridge line. The trail was very rocky again. These aren’t big rocks that you can hop on, rather, sharp pointy foot crushing rocks. My feet were really taking a beating. After a few more miles the guidebook says the trail will go through a rock maze. It took a while to get to them but the guide was correct. These were massive rock formations and the trail creators routed the trail through the rocks rather than around. If my feet didn’t hurt so much I think it would have been much more fun. After the rocks there were a few more steep ups and downs to get to the Alec Kennedy shelter where I am staying tonight. The shelter has very good cellular data so I was able to check in with home. I was also able to watch some of the Monday night football game. This is some tough living in the woods. Just as I started to cook my dinner it started raining, more than a drizzle as it had been at times today. I am at the shelter by myself at 6 PM And I doubt anyone else will show up. There are two lofted areas and I am going to stay in one of them. Normally I would not stay in a shelter but would stay in my tent. However, with the rain it’s a whole lot easier to stay in the shelter.
This is a nice shelter  it has a privy and a spring nearby (probably dry).  It also has a bear can right next to it so taking care of my food bag is easy.  For dinner I am having a AlpineAire chicken gumbo, it’s pretty good. For dessert I will eat some of those heavy cookies.
The plan for tomorrow is a little bit complicated. I have to keep in mind my pick up day and time on Thursday. Tomorrow I will reach Boiling Springs Pennsylvania and from there it is about 15 miles of fields that the trail traverses. Through that area there is no camping allowed. Also, there’s very little water. At the road crossing in Boiling Springs there is supposed to be a quickie Mart. I hope to go in there, grab a couple of bottles of water and head on to the next shelter, which will make my day 18.4 miles. Because most of that distance is flat I should have no problem making the distance. The real problem is that the next day would leave me with only about 5 miles to hike to get to another shelter before going into Duncannon. It is possible that tomorrow night I will stay in the town of Carlisle Pennsylvania, breaking up the distances a little more evenly. We will have to see when the time comes.

As expected I indeed had the shelter to myself last night. At about 7 PM it rained lightly for about a half hour but by morning it was dry. The first chore of the day was to do a bit of surgery on the blister on my left heel. I had a safety pin that I cleaned as well as padding and bandages. I punctured the blister and drained it and was able to cover it up. I’m still not sure why all of a sudden I am getting blisters but it must be due to the incessant rocks.
By the time I was packed up and ready to go it was about 815. Today’s goal was to make it to the next shelter because you cannot camp within the Cumberland Valley. That valley stretch is about 15 miles from floor to floor. As usual coming out of camp there was a climb. It was not too bad and was followed by a down an up and then a down. Rocky the whole way. After that down the world opened up into a farmers field. It was quite amazing the contrast to go from the wooded hills to the open landscape. The trail then meandered between different farms crossing many roads until it reached the small town of Boiling Springs Pennsylvania. I passed a lot of locals out for walks in the morning and everyone was friendly. I got to the local ATC office and filled my water for the day. Within the valley there is very little water so you have to make sure that you have enough to make it through the day into the next camp. I also went to a quickie store to grab some Gatorade‘s and a candy bar.  From there the trail went up the road and eventually turned back into the fields. At one point there was a gun range. At first I could not tell if it was hunters. However when 10 shots go off in a few seconds it has to be a gun range. I survived so I guess it was not hunters. Or they were very bad hunters.
From there the trail again meandered through fields and some woods it crossed 2 interstates (I-76 & I-81) and other small local roads.
The next town I would reach is Carlisle Pennsylvania. I thought about staying there to split the final 3 days more evenly. However it was only 1 PM and it was just too early to stop. Also to get to the hotels in Carlisle I would’ve had to walk down a very busy four-lane state highway and there is nothing in the hotel area to do all day.  The hotels in that area are not highly rated either. It was an easy decision to move on.
After Carlisle I passed a southbound thru hiker named Whole Foods who stopped for a minute to chat. He gets his name because he tries to eat very healthy while on the trail. Since he is heading south I mentioned to him about my incident last Friday with the guy with the machete and the girl reading the book. I asked him to stop in that shelter and if he saw those people to move on and contact the authorities. We’ll see. I’m still not sure what to make of that whole incident. It could just have been a local out for the day.
Finally, after about six hours through the valley the trail finally started to climb. The final mile to the shelter is all uphill. But after seven days I don’t think I would have it any other way. This shelter is similar to the one I stayed in last night except it’s set up with bunks on the side with the top and bottom. I took the bottom bunk just to stay off the floor. Tonight‘s cuisine is going to be a Mountainhouse beef stroganoff. It just doesn’t get any better than this. For dessert I will finish off my chips ahoy cookies that I have been carrying around for many miles now.
The plan going forward is to do a very short day tomorrow of about 7 miles. That’s going to be a big challenge for me because I like to go. But we’ll see. I have some work I want to do on my backpack as things are just a little bit off centered. I also need to continue to let my blisters air out and maybe they will dry and get better on their own. I could just push on to Duncannon, PA and stay the night there

It was a quiet night in the shelter and I stayed in my sleeping bag later than usual. I had hoped to catch a glimpse of the Orionids meteor shower last night but when I got up at 3 to pee it was fogged in. Around eight I started to stir get my gear packed up and ready. I finished off the meat sticks I bought three days ago for breakfast. A little after nine I headed out. Today , surprisingly, the trail started out with a descent down into the valley. It crossed a couple of fields from there with small ups and downs but nothing real strenuous. Not much to see  
I then crossed a small stream and topped off my water bottles. I am not expecting any water at my destination for this evening. The trail then began climbing steeply. This actually turned out to be one of the steeper climbs of the entire trip. The first half of the day the rocks were very light and actually there were none during the fields. However, during the climb the rocks started increasing. Once I reached the ridge line and crossed through a clearing for a gas pipe line, that had excellent views by the way, the rocks really began. For the most part these were small rocks that were very pointy and they lay below the thick layer of fallen leaves. These are real ankle twisters and want to drive themselves into your foot. This went on for at least 2 miles and it was getting very frustrating. In addition my feet are sore and I have some blisters that scream with each rock. In order to set myself up for tomorrow’s pick up I made a short day of today and stopped after 7.5 miles at Cove Mountain Shelter. Unfortunately this shelter is well below the trail which means I will have to do some climbing to get back out of here tomorrow. But that’s OK. It’s a lot easier in a shelter than it is to set up in a small campsite. I’ll relax, read, and try to do nothing for the remainder of the day. That’s hard for me. Additionally there is a sign here that says be on the lookout for a porcupine that likes to find scraps that hikers leave. I am pretty good about cleaning up after myself but it would be interesting to see a porcupine wandering around.
Tomorrow my adventure will come to an end with less than 4 miles down into Duncannon Pennsylvania. The Doyle hotel serves lunch and beers and I plan to stop there to fill up and wait for my wife to arrive. I don’t think they open till about noon so I don’t wanna leave too early and get stuck waiting around. That means again tomorrow I will lounge around and take my time packing up and heading out.
I did much better this trip on food supplies. When I leave tomorrow I will virtually have nothing left and will have proportioned things exactly correct.The same is close to true with water. I usually carry far too much but this time made an effort to just have enough to get by. The extra weight is always a killer.

At about 7 last night a southbound hiker and his black lab rolled into the shelter. Nice enough guy and the dog was friendly. He said they had done 33 miles yesterday. That’s a long day any day but over these rocks it’s crazy. I don’t mind being at the shelters by myself but it is nice to have some company. Tried to see the meteor shower again but we were fully socked in with fog by midnight. 
At about 8am I started stirring and was in no rush for the final leg into town. Ate the last of my oatmeal for breakfast and the last packet of hot chocolate. I gave the other hiker my fuel canisters, a tuna pack, some tortillas and a pack of gee butter I never opened. He was very appreciative of that. I would have just put that stuff in a hiker box at the Doyle. He is waiting on a mail drop in Duncannon that won’t arrive until Monday. So, he plans to hang out at the shelter until Monday, then hike back north to Duncannon, get his package, and continue south. Not the way I would do things, but hike your own hike (HYOH). 
I got rolling about 930 and did the climb up from the shelter. From there it was generally flat with only moderate rocks. The trail then started down steeply with stairs cut into the rocks. There were no views as the fog was thick and humidity high. After one more short but steep climb, the trail reached the road. I made my way to the Doyle Hotel and arrived about 1130. It does not open for lunch until noon so I’m hanging out, typing this entry and drying off from the fog. My wife will get me at about 2 for a weekend in Harrisburg.  After a shower, of course.
This section hike is now over. It was a lot of fun. It’s nice when the plan you make months ago comes together almost exactly as it was thought out. Both MD and PA are nice and easy grade wise but the rocks can be a bit much. I hear the eastern end of PA into NJ are much rockier so I will save those for later.
