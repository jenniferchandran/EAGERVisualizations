G Cray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550476,"Over the course of the past couple months, I have come to the conclusion that life is indeed simply too short. Not sure of the exact time frame yet, but I wanted to get a couple entries in this journal now, just in case the stars align and I find myself among the NOBO hikers for the Class of 2019?!?",,View Entry,"Oct 15, Sat",0
G Cray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552125,"I have officially turned my ""intent to retire' papers to the school district, and God willing and the creek don't rise, my NOBO AT thru hike may very well be 2019. 
My neighbors really do think I've lost it when they see me setting up the hammock in the yard...in December. Seems logical to me, nothing better than a winter night in northern Illinois to test how warm the the hammock will be in the mountains.  I have a long way to go in achieving a good ""hang"" though. :-/",,View Entry,"Dec 04, Sun",0
G Cray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561689,"Although my hike is still at least a couple years away, discouraged with northern Illinois winters I packed up the car and went south for a week.  I was in quite a funk and needed something to lift my spirits.  I wanted to at least step foot on the trail!  I've never been to NC in my life, but for some reason that was the state that seemed to be calling my name.  
While down in the Hot Springs, NC area I found a piece of property that was on THE same mountain as the AT crosses over that was an absolute steal! The property runs almost alongside national forest land, about .3 mile down the mountain from the trail.  Forget about the fact that this piece of property has barely enough flat land for a structure...if the AT is literally in your back yard, that's all that matters, right?
I considered it destiny.  So...I now have a personal campground between Max Patch and Hot Springs!!!
A bonus benefit of a piece of property too steep to build much on...it has a waterfall!",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Fri",0
G Cray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568345,"Today it got serious.  I have purchased a bit of equipment, made a couple trips out east to get a taste of hiking in the Appalachian Mountains, made posts in this journal, even bought a piece of property to have my piece of the earth next to the trail...but it really became real today.  
I had this years sixth graders for the last time today (elementary school goes to 6th grade in our district) .  They have come to library once a week for six years. I have known some of them for half their lives. I took advantage of our last week together to share my retirement goals of walking the AT.   I told them that in the fall of 2019, when they were entering their freshman year, I would (hopefully) be entering the White Mountains...they applauded.  It was at that moment I realized what a commitment I had made!  
As I have done every year I read them Oh, The Places You'll Go, by Dr. Seuss.  In his whimsical, nonsense way, Seuss offers some great words of wisdom for anyone going through a transition in life.  When I created this trail journal it made perfect sense to have my signature line be the last line of this fabulous book:  ""Your mountain is waiting, so get on your way.""  However, as I was reading it this year, I realized how many lines from this book could be a mantra on a thru-hike.  So, I'd like to  risk copyright violations, and share (most of) it here.  
Congratulations!Today is your day.You’re off to Great Places!You’re off and away!
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes.You can steer yourself any direction you choose.You’re on your own. And you know what you know.And YOU are the guy who’ll decide where to go.You’ll look up and down streets. Look ‘em over with care.About some you will say, “I don’t choose to go there.”With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet,you’re too smart to go down any not-so-good street.
And you may not find any you’ll want to go down. In that case, of course, you’ll head straight out of town.  It’s opener there in the wide open air.Out there things can happen and frequently doto people as brainy and footsy as you.And when things start to happen, don’t worry. Don’t stew.Just go right along. You’ll start happening too. 
OH! THE PLACES YOU’LL GO!
You’ll be on your way up! You’ll be seeing great sights!You’ll join the high fliers who soar to high heights. You won’t lag behind, because you’ll have the speed.  You’ll pass the whole gang and you’ll soon take the lead. Wherever you fly, you’ll be best of the best Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.
Because, sometimes, you won’t.I’m sorry to say so but, sadly, it’s truethat Bang-ups and Hang-ups can happen to you.You can get all hung up in a prickle-ly perch.And your gang will fly on. You’ll be left in a Lurch.You’ll come down from the Lurch with an unpleasant bump.And the chances are, then, that you’ll be in a Slump. And when you’re in a Slump, you’re not in for much fun.Un-slumping yourself is not easily done.
You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.Some windows are lighted. But mostly they’re darked.A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?How much can you lose? How much can you win?and IF you go in, should you turn left or right…or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite?Or go around back and sneak in from behind?Simple it’s not, I’m afraid you will find,for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.
I’m afraid that some times you’ll play lonely games too.Games you can’t win ‘cause you’ll play against you.All Alone! Whether you like it or not,Alone will be something you’ll be quite a lot.And when you’re alone, there’s a very good chanceyou’ll meet things that scare you right out of your pants.There are some, down the road between hither and yon,that can scare you so much you won’t want to go on.
But on you will go though the weather be foul.On you will go though your enemies prowl.On you will go though the Hakken-Kraks howl.Onward up many a frightening creek,though your arms may get sore and your sneakers may leak. On and on you will hike. And I know you’ll hike farface up to your problems whatever they are.
You’ll get mixed up, of course, as you already know.You’ll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go.So be sure when you step. Step with care and great tactand remember that Life’s a Great Balancing Act.Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.And never mix up your right foot with your left.And will you succeed? Yes! You will, indeed!(98 and ¾ percent guaranteed.)KID, YOU’LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!So… be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Brayor Mordecai Ali Van AllenO’Shea,you’re off to Great Places! Today is your day!",,View Entry,"May 12, Fri",0
G Cray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565881,"While I wait for 2019, I enjoy living vicariously through other trailjournals....except when the person suddenly stops journaling.   Then I wonder, did they decide not to journal their hike after all?  Are they just planning to catch up on their entries at some future date?  Did they quit the trail?  Were they eaten by AT Zombies?  So many unanswered questions after spending several months following their journey.  I feel a final entry updating anyone following is simply the considerate thing to do...isn't it?  So, to any of you that decide to read about the insanity that lurks in my head while I am walking in the woods, please know, should I abruptly stop journaling, it must have been the zombies.",,View Entry,"May 24, Wed",0
G Cray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580209,"The training plan for my 2019 thru hike never included PT for ACL surgery...unfortunately now it does.In trying to be more of a Pollyanna than an Eeyore, I am incredibly glad that the complete tear of my ACL came from a boneheaded move in my own home Labor Day weekend, rather than atop a 6,000 foot mountain.   I'll also look at it as ""training"" as far as unexpected plans and rolling with what you are dealing with...which usually includes some kind of pain and suffering. :-) I am also glad it is going to be the middle of winter here in Northern Illinois while I am healing, rather than the warmer months of the year that I prefer being outdoors.  In fact, maybe I'll end up doing MORE physical fitness than most winters, I've always been a hermit in the dead of winter...cold is my kryptonite!  A month of PT has gotten me to the point of being *ready* for surgery.  The goal was to get a bend of at least 120 degrees, and for it to straighten to zero degrees.  Next week I go see the doc, get the surgery scheduled, and hopefully by Christmas can begin the PT all over again.  I refuse to let this bring me down, or damper my plans.  If anything it has made me more determined.",,View Entry,"Nov 04, Sat",0
G Cray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586049,"It's been quite some time since I've written here, or even visited.  I've been in quite a funk, couldn't even bring myself to read about other peoples hikes, and didn't even want to think about my own.  for a brief period of time, I almost wrote off the whole idea. The knee surgery was horrendous.  I did not recover nearly as quickly as hoped and ended up taking off work an additional month.   Atrophy set in my thigh, and for several weeks no matter how hard I tried I could not get my leg to function.  It was truly terrifying.  It did finally kick in, thank goodness.  As I write, it has been nearly four months since the surgery.  I can pretty much walk normally, although I can certainly feel my knee when I'm walking (particularly down) steps, or hit around 8,000 steps on the fitbit.  That goal everyone shoots for of 10,000 steps is in my sights, hopefully by the end of next week.  Hard to believe this time last year I would hit a minimum of 16,000 steps daily, and 20-25K wasn't uncommon.   Funny how life changes.Which brings up the main reason for my recent funk.  The week prior to my surgery I had taken my dog, Merlot, in for tests as something was wrong that was causing swelling in his throat.  The very day of my surgery (three hours post-op) I received the phone call telling me he had lymphoma.  It was in it's advanced stages, and due to his age (7), and breed (Mastiff) they recommended that I just let him live his life as comfortably as possible.  They said it could be a couple weeks to a couple months that he had left.  This meant I MIGHT ever be able to walk with him again.  I was devastated. Merlot died on February 12.  He made it almost two months from the day of his diagnosis.  He had one last good weekend with my grandsons that completely did him in, and it was obvious it was Time.  We had the vet make a home visit the following Monday so he could be put to rest in his home.  Due to the atrophy that had set in to my quad, while he was still able, I was never able to take him for a walk.  By the time I could walk, he wasn't up for anything beyond the mailbox.  My heart breaks all over again as I type this.  He was my one constant hiking partner.  I will miss him terribly.  During January, as I laid in bed unable to move my leg, and he laid on the floor beside me with his days numbered, I could not even think of wanting to hike...anywhere.  That dark cloud hung over for quite some time.  It's only been in the past couple weeks that I've been able to bring myself to start reading some TJ's, and FB posts of this year's hikers.  It was probably the best thing for me!  I did however decide to postpone my hike one more year. :-/  It simply seemed the wisest choice due to the not exactly speedy healing of the knee.  And, shakedown hikes I had planned for this spring and summer aren't a good idea at this point, and this flatlander needs more mountain experience before I take on an AT thru!  I probably *could* still attempt it in 2019, but I feel I would have two strikes against me right out of the gate.  So, I'll take the next year and a half to get completely back up to par, and set the new countdown timer for 2020...that's got a good ring to it anyway.  Meantime...my retirement is on the horizon, my knee is on the mend, and as much as life has sucked so far this year, it's time to end the pity party, and move on.RIP MERLOT  2011-2018",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Sat",0
G Cray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593429,"After much back and forth with my start date.  I think I've finally decided...I am not going to do a thru-hike.  Well, not as far as the purists are concerned.  I still plan to hike the entire Appalachian Trail from the approach trail (yes, I WANT to do the approach!) through to Katahdin.  But, I'm going to take a few zeros, zero months that is, which is why I guess it will technically be two LASH'es.
From when I first began planning, my biggest fear has been the cold.  I do not do well in cold...at all.  I kept thinking of different ways to avoid the brunt of it...late start (but I'd have to rush to finish), SOBO (this flatlander wouldn't do well with a SOBO hike), flip-flop (but a Katahdin end wasn't logistically possible), and finally I decided it simply cannot happen without breaking up the hike, and I am perfectly okay with that.
So, the plan (it is decided, 99% sure this time) is this:   I am going to Springer mountain in the fall of 2019, headed northbound.  I will hike until it's too cold...hopefully that won't be until at least Thanksgiving.  Or maybe I'll get lucky, and Mother Nature will smile on me and provide a mild December.  Whenever it may be that I am no longer enjoying the hike, I'll head home.  Then, in the spring of 2020, when it's REALLY spring, I'll go back to wherever I stopped and continue NOBO.  That should give me plenty of time (God willing) to make it to Maine before the temps begin to drop too much. 
Not a true thru-hike, but definitely a bit more ambitious than your standard section hike.  It is the best solution I could come up with to deal with my hatred of the cold, which I have always felt had the most potential for me to not succeed.  I'll be able to enjoy the beauty of the Smoky's in the fall, rather than hate life while I freeze my ass off hiking through them. It also allows me to get on the trail sooner than waiting until Spring of 2020.  Sounds like a win/win...until I have to have a conversation about it with a purist that is. :-)",,View Entry,"Jun 08, Fri",0
