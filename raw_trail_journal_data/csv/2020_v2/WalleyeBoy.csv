WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558707,"The journey begins. Quite the trip getting here. There was a heck of a lot of traffic coming down here during the week when you would think people were working.Rained most of the trip down. Picked up a truck yesterday and dropped it at Woody's Gap. Guess we need to make it that far by Monday.We got an early start Saturday. Little chilly at the start. Walked up to Spring Mountain southern termilus. Lexy pulled me all the way up and down. I stayed with the leash for another mile but had to give it up. The ATC trail person thanked us for keeping Lexy on a leash but she was no problem without one, and my arm felt much better. She stayed walking right with us the entire trip.Legs were really feeling it on the ascents. Going to take some time to get in shape. We hiked to Hawk Mountain campsite (7.4 miles). Most of the campsites are carved out of the hill and are adequate. Water was a long walk down for us since we were site 7 of 30 going down. Water was good but I'm guessing as it drys out the water source will dwindle. Stopped at Stover Shelter for a break, real nice shelter (see picture). Crossed Three Forks with looked busy with weekend campers, nice creek runs through the campsite. Found some nice Trail Magic at Hickory Flats. Trail Magic is when someone gives back by supplying things like food, drink or other much needed supplies. We picked up some water, had hot dogs, ice cold pop and other snacks. Nice people.","Springer Mountain

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558708,"Really good water spot a mile down the trail from Hawk Mountain campsite, filled our bottles. The ascend after Horse Gap is a tough one; pretty steep. Then we hit Coopers Gap and the Justus Mountain climb, which is one of the toughest in Georgia and one of the toughest until Maine from what I've heard. Scooby (AKA Katz) ran out of gas about 3/4 way up and I picked up her pack, put it on my head and finished the climb. Had to take a break at the top because my legs were rubber. She was able to regain her mountain legs for the rest of the day. I felt like the miles shown in the book were by way of the crow and it seems to take forever to get in another 7 miles. We stopped at Justus Creek campsite which has lots of spots, which was good because, like Hawk Mountain, there were many fellow hikers. Justus Creek was flowing really nice and wide. Great water source.","Hawk Mountain campsite

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558709,"Started the day with rain, filled our bottles and Scooby (AKA Katz) and Lexy started out while I took down the tent. They made really good time before I caught up. Nice trail today, not look steep up or down. We missed, what I think were really cool views because it was a constant rain all day with think cloud cover. Missed a turn on the way back to Spring Mountain parking which caused us to do a complete circle and cost us about 45 minutes, not cool. Roads are all up, down, and S curves and slow speeds. Went for a big ribeye at Fatz in Blairsville for a reward. Had a good conversation with our waitress (Kim) who hiked most of the AT. Very friendly which is always awesome after spending three days with a mixed crowd. The Trail Magic people were really nice and a few other people on the trail but many kept to themselves and didn't talk too much. Expecting more conversations but maybe that is the beginning when people are still trying to figure it out and are hurting from the up and down. Lexy was a big hit with most people.

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559127,"Morning started off perfect. Nice and quite, little wind, some sun but it turned rainy after about an hour. Ran into a few fellow hikers that also started 4/1. Missed some nice views on top of Blood Mountain because of the thick cloud cover and rain. Talked to Herbie on top of Blood Mountain, she was contemplating staying in the shelter until the storm passed but I said I was heading down and she decided to do the same. Slippery slope on the way down.Legs are feeling pretty wobbly. Need more time on the trail to get stronger. No hiking Thursday as the storms continued all day Wednesday and Thursday. Lots of condensation to deal with.","Jarrard Gap

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559128,"Cold cold night. Starting hiking at 36 degrees and windy. Not cool. However, I found that on the opposite side of the mountains from the wind it wasn't too bad. I shed my jacket about 15 minutes in. Nice and slow up and slow down mostly, which was good as the legs will need time to adjust. Nice and sunny today but a bit on the cool side still. Supposed to warm up for the weekend.Talked to lots of hikers today on the trail, they are coming back out after scattering to towns while the storms moved through. One toe is showing signs of trouble. Could lose a nail if I'm not careful.","Woodys Gap

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559412,"Longest hike today. I did 12.9 miles. Started to run out of gas the last mile.Started at Neels Gap where Mountain Crossing outfitters is located. Nice place, kind of like REI but smaller building, kind of rustic. Nice people. Bought Colleen a pair of Leki trekking poles. When you are old like us you need the help ascending and descending. :-) Started off in the mid 30's but 20 minutes into it I shed a two layers and another layer about two hours into the hike. I did like my water proof golfing gloves and kept them on for about four hours. The gloves help with the cold but also with the rubbing of the trekking poles. Warmed up to the mid 60's which was perfect. Real nice walk today and took some nice pictures atop Wolf Laurel Top and Wildcat Mountain. Stopped for lunch and to tend to my blisters at Tesnatee Gap. The blister on the 2nd toe of the right foot hasn't come back but that is the toe that is taking a beating. Blisters on the 3rd toe of the left foot. Relieved the pressure twice during the day. The 2nd time seemed to do the trick.Pretty good trails today which allowed me to get in some miles. Stopped at Low Gap Shelter to rest and get some water. Met some nice people there, I was thinking about staying in the shelter but decided to go another mile to Poplar Stamp Gap camp area. Good call as I heard later that some people were throwing up and it sounded like a group had gotten the norovirus somewhere along the trail. Must have been a group that got there after I left. Found a good group up the trail. Couple brother were from Minnesota but moved to Tennessee, one Boston guy, three Maine guys, and two from Colorado. One guys had the same Solomon boots I had on and a guy from Maine had the same Altra's I've been wearing. Nice fire before bed; I didn't stay up too late as I was very much ready for bed. It didn't get as cold as I thought it was going to be which was nice. Some of the guys hung their foot up on the main truck of the tree. I tried telling them that bears can and will climb. They didn't get it, oh well can't fix stupid although what do I know, I've never had a bear encounter either.","Poplar Stamp Gap

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559417,"What a beautiful day. Woke up around 7:00 and it wasn't cold like the past few mornings. Packed up and ate a Pop Tart. Hit the trail at 8:00am. Got to Unicoi Gap at noon which wasn't too bad considering I was feeling the effects of a 13 mile day the previous. Looks like I can do about 2 mph including breaks if the trail isn't too steep. Once I get my mountain legs, which I hear is about two weeks, and I get out of the tough Georgia terrain, I might be able to get 2.5 or even 3 mph. Drank a lot of water today. Water so far has been abundant and cold/clear. Rain into some more Trail Magic at Unicoi Gap; pretty cool when people go out of their way to supply things like snacks, cold drinks, or even pizza like today. Pretty awesome. After Colleen picked me up we picked up the Dodge. It has a small antifreeze leak coming down the console by the passenger side. Will need to find a mechanic. Always something. Colleen was able to get the camper setup Saturday with the help of Cliff at the Lone Ridge Camp ground. Cliff is retire and spends his time helping out the owners and bides his time here (Hiawassee and Florida). He helped me figure out the hot water issue we were having. Some times it just take another person to talk to and have look at before you finally figure it out. Hot and cold were coming together which is why the hot was only warm. Learn as you go I guess.

Well fun for me and Scooby is still trying to figure out where the fun is :-). Most miles in one for her and most in a weekend. We had a couple of long tough hikes of about a mile up. Rocky Mountain followed by Tray Mountain. Nice views on Tray. We had a really nice campsite at The Swag of the Blue Ridge. The plan was to setup camp, eat, and have a fire. Never got to the fire part. Too tuckered out I guess. So far ATT has been pretty good and many fellow hiker expressed the same. I heard that Verizon is the preferred carrier in Virginia; we'll see about North Carolina.Water was a little less abundant than normal but we found enough. Lighter is the name of the game and we dropped some weight which helps going up. We found we didn't miss the extra stuff.","Unicoi

Dirt just didn't wash off in the shower, what's up with that. Sticky dirt. We went into town for an all you can eat that lots of hikers seek out because it's only $8.95. We found out there is a reason it is only $8.95, not good and I'm usually pretty easy. Relaxed back at the camper Sunday night after a hot shower and meal.People of north Georgia have been real friendly and helpful. One interesting thing is that I haven't noticed a bar since we got here. Kind of weird since Minnesota is full of them.","The Swag of the Blue Ridge

Rained most of the night and then for the first 8.5 miles I didn't have any rain and I was able to get a few nice pics. Finished the day walking in rain for the last mile and half. Ran into a guy standing around in the rain when I got to Deep Gap, I made conversation and found out he was looking for a ride into town. Gave him a ride into Hiawassee to find his brother. Nick (Wicked Fast) on the account he was from Maine and moves slow in the morning. I'm a little behind my goal but maybe after the move to Franklin, NC I can make up some miles.","Blue Ridge Gap

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561551,"Colleen dropped me off at Wayah Gap Friday night. Walked two miles in the rain so I walked the half mile off trail to see if the shelter was open. Got there late and there were 10 guys hanging out and one girl sleeping in the shelter. I figured I might have to setup my tent in the rain. Wasn't looking forward to it. As it turns out all the guys were staying in tents around the shelter so it was wide open. Worked for me, especially since it rained hard most of the night. No critters tickling my face or trying to share my sleeping bag. The shelter had some nice spots to hang our packs with metal cones to stop the mice from climbing down the rope. Woke at first light and was on the trail by 7:15am.","Wayah Gap

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561553,"Pretty good of hiking. Did 16 miles which is the most I've done in one day. Felt it too by the end of the day. I crossed some nice creeks that were flowing pretty. Cool waterfall just before Winding Stair Gap.As I was approaching Rock Gap I hear someone yelling. As it turns out there was a women and very large dog off the trail. This was a very steep landscape and the women was trying teach her dog to do its business off the trail. Bad idea; once the dog stepped off the trail it slide down the side and couldn't get back up. Big dog and very heavy pack. Women told me she took the pack off and it rolled, unabated probably 75 yards down. She was trying to retrieve the back but the dog kept trying to follow her. Did I mention this was a very steep drop. I helped get the dog up and kept him on the trail while the women went the rest of the way down. It took her half an hour to go down and back up. 
About a 1/4 mile down the path is a parking lot where I met a old couple walking to Maine. She had a beer in hand and said a doctor had just left but he was handing out ice cold beer (more trail magic). Dang I missed out and I sure could have used something ice cold at that point in the day. Oh well, it might have been hard to leave otherwise.
Albert Mountain is a very steep climb but on a sunny day, the reward is the cool views. There is an old fire tower that you can climb to the top of the stairs to get some nice pictures. The room is closed but from the stairs you can see 360. Very technical climb down the rocks; not sure how Lexy would have done going down. I checked the weather and saw it was supposed to rain before dark so I picked myself up off a nice resting spot and moved on to Betty Creek Gap.
I made it by 5:30 and setup camp. Lots of people there, which is good and bad. Wish I had found a shelter as it rained very hard and the wind was strong.","Siler Bald Shelter

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561557,"Woke, actually didn't sleep much, at first light to rain. Funny, raining again. Hard rain and high winds throughout the night. Tent started to let rain in as I kept rubbing one of the sides. No good. Sleeping bag was dry mostly since it was on the sleeping pad. Packed up in the rain and I must have added another two pounds to my pack with all the water. Hit the trail at 7:00am and a long climb up. Lucky it was not super steep. My walk was through a burn area. I couldn't tell if the burn was this year or last year. I could smell it and there wasn't any new green vegetation so maybe this year. Big area burned. 12 miles of hiking in rain and water flowing down the trail all day long. I didn't bother to stop for much of a break because I just wanted to get back to my truck and find me some hot food and a warm trailer. When I got back to my truck which had been parked in the woods for five days, it looked like the mice might have been in the cab. I set some traps but nothing, so maybe they ditched the truck once I got under way. Lots of mud came off my rain pants, shoes and socks when I got back. Colleen was great and had hot taco's waiting after I got out of the shower. Pounded those down quickly. Good thing I wasn't staying on the trail, because it rained the rest of the day and into the night, at times it came down very very hard. Water must have been flowing down those mountains pretty hard.
Hit another milestone today, crossed the 100 mile mark. If I was hiking like I planned originally I would have reach the milestone by day 8 or 9, but hey I'm out here with Colleen and we are walking the Appalachian Trail.","Betty Creek Gap campsite

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562556,"Very gray day to start, warmed up to be very humid. I hiked to the NOC where they do whitewater rafting and kayaking. They do competition kayaking  and they held the 2013 championships here. Big 1/2 lb burgers at the Rivers End. Nice views of the river from you table. Ate there twice and watch people working the rapids in their kayaks; some where flipping front over back, they had the short kayaks, others were practicing going through the gates and they had the long sleek kayaks. Looks like there are many different types.
I picked up Scooby and Lexy at the NOC and we headed up out of the gorge. Nice pine trees in this area which I have seem much of so far. Made it up to near Wright Gap. We could hear some kind of machine clearing an area below us. Looks like some houses not too far away. Never a good idea to eat a big burger and then climb up a mile and half in hot humid weather. :-(  We did find a nice spot just off the trail that was covered in pine needles for our campsite. 
Scooby's pack wasn't working out very good so we picked up a new one for her. Got the Exos 48, which has a little more room but is lighter and fits better (at least I hope it does).

We got going around 7:30am and little did we know what was ahead for us. 6.5 miles of nothing but up and some spots were very exhausting climbs. We had some nice views as most of the haze went away and the sun came out. Took a nice break at Swim Bald where you get a nice view of the Smokies. Very vertical climb after that though and when every we came to water we either put our heads under the falls or poured the cold water on us. I think it was around 83 Saturday.
Took another break at the Sassafras Gap Shelter and retrieved some water from the nearby spring. Well needed need break even though we had only gone about a mile. When we left we had new energy, which helped get us close to the top of the mountain. Problem was the last .3 miles was one hell of  climb up. I powered up and went back and grabbed Scooby's pack as she was running on empty. What a view once on top though. Nice grassy area for tenting, except it was very windy so we set up camp on the other side inside the trees. Just as we were finishing eating a short burst of rain came down and made every thing wet. Ducked in the tent around 7:00pm and didn't emerge until 6:30am Sunday.","Somewhere past NOC

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562562,"Woke up early around 6:30, packed up quickly in the haze and wind, and beat cheeks for Stecoah Gap where our truck was waiting. Mostly down hill today with just a couple somewhat short hikes up. Felt like we were walking in a jungle on this side of the mountain. Very warm and sunny day again but since we were headed down it felt good to me. We made fairly quick work of it and got to the truck before noon, which is right on with my estimate. I'm getting about 2 mph, including breaks, when I walk alone, and around 1.25 with Scooby and Lexy. Stopped at the Rivers End again for another big fat burger and a big ice cold Root beer. Yummy when you are hungry and thirsty. I don't drink much pop now a days but boy did it taste good. I really want to whitewater raft but I really don't have time.I didn't have as much problem with my toes/feet these last few days so I'm hoping I might have figured something out.

Met a group who was trying to get their mother off the trail. Apparently, her youngest son hit her in the head with a rock from a slingshot. Help arrived and got her off the trail.

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563642,"Started the hike at 1:00pm, which turns out to be a little late since there were a lot of hikers coming from the near by Fontana Dam Shelter (Hilton as they call it because of the amenities like showers, trash bins, running water). That shelter holds more hikers than other shelters and Mollies at 11 miles out is the next logical stopping point for anyone staying at the Hilton. There is another shelter about 3 miles further which took the overflow. It started raining as I made my way up there and was pouring by the time I arrived. The place was full so I took a bench for the night. Good thing though is that they had a rip roaring fire going, which help to get things dried out. I started hiking in a tee shirt and ended with a few layers on. Prelude of what was to come.
I spent most of the night tossing and turning on the hard bench, so needless to say I didn't get much sleep. I woke early and hit the trail by 7:00am to try and get a jump on the younger faster hikers. Still haven't seen much pine or firs during the hike, some in Georgia but very few in North Caroline. Lots of Oak and Rhododendrons. I'm kind of done with the Rhododendrons though, not my fave.","Fontana Dam
",Mollies Ridge Shelter,"May 05, Fri",11.30
WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563650,"Woke early to some sun but very wet conditions. Little cold but no signs of snow yet. Had a quick breakfast a little way down the trail with water still dripping from the trees. As I ascended I started to notice white stuff on the ground. I thought it was kind of cool to see some bits of snow but when I came around a corner and looked to my left I could see a lot of snow on a mountain top. What I didn't know at the time is that I'd be in that snow later that day. I only got passed by two guys from Mollies this day which got me out front of the mob but I caught up to another big group which again had me coming in to camp too late. Shelter was full, I was 17 miles into it and very very tired as this was the most miles I'd walk so far. To top it off I was walking through lots of water and mud. Made for very slippery conditions, both going up and going down. Lunch was at noon and I made the mistake of not eating for the next six hours. The unfortunate thing about the no room at the Inn is that they had a nice warm fire going at Silers Bald Shelter. I had met a young girl on the way up and she decided to keep going the extra 1.7 miles up to the Double Springs Gap Shelter, exhausted as I was I decided I was not going to spend another night on the dirt floor or bench so I took a short break and made the climb.
We were now entering my favorite forest, firs and pines. Not pines but lots of Fraser Fir trees. I noticed the change but I was too tired and cold to care much. At this point the mud on the trail made the last 1.7 miles feel like walking three miles. I made the mistake of not taking my Solomen mid hikers, which are water proof and go a little higher up the ankle. I elected to go with the lighter Altra trail shoe, which lets the water in and are low cut. When I got to Double Springs Gap Shelter I was Katie and another pack/sleeping bag in the shelter. No fire however, but at that point I was glad to have made the climb and finally found a shelter with room. I was totally exhausted, hungry, and I could feel my body heat dropping. Cold and wet I decided I better eat, so I downed a packet of tuna, a packet of Spam, and trail mix. I gathered some wood but it was hard to come by with somewhere around 4-5 inches of snow on the ground. I looked for small standing trees that were dead. Found a few but they were still somewhat wet. By this time the sun was pretty much down and the cold was really starting to set in. I think it down to freezing that night. 
Katie tried to light a fire but the wood would not stay lit, even the paper I took from the log book wouldn't really burner. Another hiker (Matt) showed up about this time. We were probably an hour into trying to get a fire lit with no luck when I really started getting the shivers so I thought I better change in to dry clothes and jump in my sleeping bag. As it turns out, no one ever came to claim the pack and sleeping bag so we figured they must have decided they were too heavy and so they left them. As it turned out I think God was watching out for me because I needed that extra sleeping bag to get my body temp back up. A gift placed there that saved the day for me. It took until around 9:30pm before I was able to come out and not be immediately cold. In the mean time, with no luck getting the fire going with paper, toilet paper, small wood chips, I said use your Jet Boil cooker and blast the wood for a while and see what happens. After 15 minutes of blasting, we finally had a small fire going. Matt worked it for 30 minutes and slowing but surely we got it going enough to dry out our socks, shoes, and gloves. Having dry shoes in the morning was a huge thing, considering we would have to walk another 10 miles in mostly snow, water, and mud. We had a good bond, which you don't get in an overflowing shelter. 
Katie recently graduated from college, quit her job to walk the trail and was headed to Gatlinburg on Sunday to meet up with some hiker friends. Matt is from Long Island but recently moved to New Orleans to get his masters. What a night but we survived and woke to super fantastic day on Sunday. I actually had my best night sleeping since starting on the trail. Normally I don't sleep much, mostly just toss and turn all night. This night, probably with no sleep the night before, I finally slept most of the night.","Mollies Ridge Shelter
",Double Spring Gap Shelter,"May 06, Sat",19.70
WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563661,"What difference a day can make. We woke late, around 8:00am. Other hikers from Silers Bald started showing up to eat and get water. They were all very surprised to find only three of use in the 16 place shelter, and wishing they had also gone the extra 1.7 miles. Now the sun was shining bright and our spirits were renewed. I looked around and the snow was starting to melt a little, which is good and bad. Good that the sun was out and the temps were going up some, but bad in that it creates more water and mud. We were all exited to get to Clingman's Dome on this sunny day, which is the highest elevation on the AT. I started first figuring those two would catch me but as it turns out, Katie never caught up but Matt did and we finished the walk to Newfound Gap. As we made the climb to Clingman's Dome we were getting more and more into the snow, many parts of the trail were still covered in snow under the Fraser's. I love the Fraser's and pine, with their unmistakable scent and majestic size. If you have ever been in a forest of firs like the Fraser you will notice that not much sun reaches the ground, they either grow really thick or really big and block out most of the sun. We had some great views this day with the bright sun. Clingman's Dome is on the top of Mount Buckley at somewhere around 6600 feet above sea level. There is a concrete observation structure the gives you a beautiful 360 view of the mountains. On this day I could see quite far. Apparently with the surrounding air pollution, visibility has been cut down by as much as 40%. Still looked pretty cool to me. We spent the Saturday trying to avoid the mud as much as we could but now we were trying to avoid the low hanging branches which were covered in snow and ice. I had to wear my rain gear and hood as I walked because it was a never ending brush with the wet branches on the way down. Once we got down to the 5,500 range we hit the dang mud again. What could have been a nice somewhat easy hike turned into a puddle jumping hike and very wet again. Crunchy snow on top but very wet as we made out way down. It was funny when I ran into some day hikers, I said lots of much and they would say, ""yeah I know but walking through it"". The funny thing is I tried to tell them what they were walking through was nothing compared to where they were headed. Here I was in my full rain gear, and here they were in their spandex and running shoes, coming from 66 degrees and dry, to 42 degrees with lots of snow melting and very wet conditions. When I got to Indian Gap road, I was down to 5,300 feet and no snow. I came out of the woods to see people laying on the hillside taking in the sun and warm temps. I quickly shed the rain gear and other layers of clothing, rearranged my pack and was set to finish the last 1.7 miles. Matt said lets knock this off quickly so we powered up the hill and down the other side in about 25 to 30 minutes. By this point I was getting pretty hungry and so was Matt. He was continuing the hike and was going to take a break for lunch, we said out goodbyes and I walked over to the side of the road where there was a pullover. Newfound Gap is on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, with a nice view and large parking lot for the tourists. You would think I would be able to catch a ride into Cherokee where I was to meet up with Colleen but I don't think tourist are much inclined to pick up a dirty hiker so I sat there for 45 minutes. One guy tried to give me a ride but he was going to Clingman's and I didn't really want to go back up the mountain :-). Car after car went by, no luck. Finally a small SUV pulled over. He said they had taken a hiker to Gatlinburg earlier and where headed back down to Cherokee, which is where I was going so perfect. He opened the back hatch and said hop in but I'd have to share the back with his malamute/wolf. I jumped in and off we went. Hooked up with Colleen and chowed down a large stuff crust pizza with three Pepsi's. Now for a hot shower and a little down time. Whew what a three day trek.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

We had a nice sunny day with the rain a mountain or two away. We could hear the thunder every once in a while but it would not catch us until the night. Lot's of people out on the trails around the falls area. I area had the look of being out west with a lot more pine and rock than you see in this area. Drier too. We stopped just a little ways down from the falls and went for a dip in the water. Didn't stay in long as the water was a little bit on the cold side. Felt great though with temps in the 80's. Chris from St Louis came up on us again and we had another good chat. Apparently he met some local friends and spend the night in their RV, which explains why he came from the rear.The trek out of the falls area is 3 miles and 2000 feet up. Little work getting out of there but we managed to make it to the top to a place called Pond Flats. Our water was running low and the spring near there wasn't flowing very fast, but I worked it for three liters. Scooby and Lexy were about done after the climb so I grabbed Scoob's pack and head the last could clicks to camp. There are three of four nice campsites around the spring.

Lexy however, was mostly on the tent floor and there is no such thing as a water proof tent. Packed up in the rain which adds more weight to your pack. Scooby took off a few minutes ahead of Lexy and me as I finished packing. I figured I would catch her in a few minutes. I was wrong, she decided to jog down the mountain and I didn't catch her until the 1.5 mile mark. I move pretty fast so I started to worry a bit. All ended well as we reached the bottom (2.5 miles) in less than an hour. What a welcome site it was to see the Shook Branch shelter when we crossed the road. Out of the rain and real restrooms, don't get those very often. :-)After about a half hour out of the rain we started for our destination (Wilbur Dam Road). Rained the entire time but luckily it was a light rain. Nice walk around the lake and dam. I guess there is a female bear in the area that has figured out there is food where there are people so the Watauga Lake Shelter is closed and has been since 2015. Signs posted around Hwy 321 to somewhere past Wilbur Dam Road saying don't stop along the trail, just keep on moving. Doesn't sound like it will end well for the bear. Drenched, cold, tired and hungry we packed up and headed back to base camp for hot showers and pizza. Lots of pizza.

After the first mile my right calf was not feeling good. I pressed on until around the 16 mile mark when I started running out of energy. I was thinking about stopping short of the shelter but remembered why I wanted to stay at the shelter; I wanted to be under a roof when it rained. Good call to push on, and I put it in overdrive.

Took off a little late which is unusual for me. Wanted to get to Bald Mountain Shelter which was 18.9 mile away. I knew after about 15 miles that it want going to happen. Good news was that my right calf wasn't a problem anymore. Funny how that works. 
Got to Sam's Gap feeling pretty good but that changed quickly. From Sam's Gap to the shelter is around eight up hill miles. I ran out of gas and pretty much had to gut it out to reach the summit of Bald Mountain but there was  nothing left to get me the last 1.7 miles. For about the last two miles I told myself I would take the next campsite I came across. Problem was, there wasn't any. Quite unusual, there are always uncharted campsites, well there wasn't until I was .3 from the center of the Bald. Winds blow hard atop Bald so it was good to stop. The last .8 was a very steep grade with many big rocks/borders to climb over. 
The campsite worked out great as I would leave 7.2 for Monday, and I could finally get the pack off. Setup camp, ate, hung my food bag and retired into my tent. While hanging my bag I startled some hoofed animal about twenty feet away, probably a deer but the vegetation was too dense to see it. About 11:30pm I was awaken but someone walking by with a headlamp on. Kind of creepy since the person went off the trail to pass next to me. I thought I was the only nut to walk late at night.

Beartown Mountain and Roan High Bluff. Normal North Carolina AT trail 
until I hit the higher elevation where I got into nearly 100% Fraser 
Firs and Red Spruce. Unusual from what I've been hiking in. The Red 
Spruce looks a lot like a pine tree in many regards except the needles 
that fall are shorter and the cones are much smaller, measuring no more 
than around an inch. But if you were to look at one in the forest 
surrounding you would think pine tree. The firs were not anything like 
The Great Smoky Mountains in that they looked to be much younger. The 
Great Smoky Mountain firs were very large, older grow trees. 
There
used to be a glamorous hotel on the bluff called Cloudland Hotel. It 
was there for about twenty years, from the late 1800's to the early 
1900's. Just a few stone structures remain. Nice area though and I 
stopped on top for lunch. The back side had a lot of new growth going 
on, very thick/dense firs coming up. Once I got to Carver's Gap and 
crossed the road the whole look changed. Now I started up to the balds -
Round Bald, Jane Bald, Little Hump Mountain, Hump Mountain. Quit 
interesting coming out of the forest and onto open mountain tops covered
mostly with grass and a few small scrub trees. 
As I was hiking 
down from Roan High Knob I kept hearing thunder and it looked like rain.
I wasn't feeling good about that since I was about to go on the bald's.
Lucky the storm held off until night and then was mostly rain. I set up
camp on Little Hump Mountain with great views. I didn't want to climb 
up to Hump Mountain figuring if there is a storm I'd be at the highest 
point. 
I did miss the Overmountain Shelter, which is a very popular shelter on the trail. It is an old barn converted to a shelter with great views. It was used as a backdrop for the movie ""Winter People"". And since I would be continuing on, I would also miss staying at the Mountain Harbour B&B, know for their super fantastic breakfast.

As I finished packing and put on my pack I noticed dense fog/clouds rolled in and realized I'd be walking in the clouds for a while. The climb up to the top of Hump Mountain takes a bit of gas to get up there. I'm sure there were nice views on a sunny day but there would be none for me this day. The nice thing is the rain help off most of the day. However, I was about two miles from a shelter when it started to rain and it came down light at first but then got heavy enough to soak me. I stopped at the shelter for about 45 minutes to an hour to let it pass. Talked with a few hikers, some were staying and others were like me, moving on when the rain let up. Close to the shelter was a nice waterfalls called Jones Falls. Pretty good size; second biggest so far. Only Laurel Fork Falls was bigger. After I left the shelter I only had 1.5 miles to Walnut Mountain Road so I figure it would be uneventful. I was wrong. First I came across a bear cub. It was only the second bear so far that I've noticed but it was about 15 yards to my left and I didn't see the mother. Got a little nervous so I didn't linger very long. Then a little further down the trail I happen to notice a big black snake on the path. Not sure how I noticed it since it looked like the roots we frequently walk over, but I stopped and tried to get it to move. It would not move, I threw sticks at it and poked it with my trekking pole. All it did was coil its head, poised for a strike. I wasn't sure what kind of snake, I examined its head and noticed it was not shaped like an arrow so I figured it properly wasn't venomous. I backed off anyway and the snake slowly moved off the path. Later I looked it up and believe it to be a Black Rat Snake and they stop moving when they get startled.

After a brief rest at the planned shelter I decided to go to the next. Stopped along the way for a quick dip in Dismal Branch creek. Very refreshing. The last mile in half was a grind up.

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629900,"Another warm dry day. Glad I pressed on yesterday because today was two miles over rock going up and the two miles through four to seven foot high weeds/brush. Not fun but the wild blackberries were good. The last four miles or so was a very nice trail. The Warspur shelter is nice and open with good water nearby. I miscalculated my food and now I have to ration to make it to Thursday night. 
Only thing about the shelter is there is a black wasp nest under the front overhang. I’m thing about squashing it at dusk. 8.8 miles.","Bailey’s Gap shelter

Lots of great views over the three mountains, went through a weedy section, pastures, mile of rock cairns, and nice pine trail. Very warm by the time I got to the second climb and I was feeling the heat, luckily a thunderstorm broke out and cooled me down. Climb went much better.
Pasted a 300 year old oak tree (Keefer Oak). Stayed at the Niday shelter with a guy named Tomorrow. From Boston heading to Springer.

Got some hot pizza for lunch and restocked for the trip to Daleville. Crossed the 700 mark.


Six other hikers staying at the shelter (Hands and Mouth, Ziggie, Chain, Peanut Butter, Jelly, and Walrus. A game of bags (corn hole as its known here) broke out. Might be something I know lol. 


Doing the triple crown today and tomorrow. Lots of great hiking and fantastic viewing areas. Devils Tooth, McAfee Knob, Tinker Cliffs, plus a couple other nice spots. Best areas in Virginia and so far the best overall I’ve seen on the AT. 8.8 miles.","Niday shelter

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629949,"The last two days have been some of the best hiking so far on the AT. McAfee Knob was great hike up and one of the ATs most iconic spots.
Got lucky that the clouds broke for a bit when I got up there. I was not so fortunate at Tinker Cliffs. Tinker Cliffs run about a 1/4 mile with fantastic views when not cloudy day. Ended the day raining. I sat under a cliff overhang during the heavy stuff.
Stayed at Lambert’s Meadow shelter with Hands and Mouth. Met him at Four Pines along with Ziggie and Chains. Those two tented near by.

WalleyeBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630034,"Woke up to light rain. I waited a couple hours for a break but it never happened so I put on my wet gear and headed to Daleville and the Super 8 Motel. Walked four hours in the rain. Washed and dried everything and went to dinner at Panchos. I really wanted to try the Three Little Pigs (highly recommend) but it was still raining and the place was 3/4 of a mile. Decided to stay close. 9.4 miles. 
Since Daleville is within a Uber ride I decided to call it. Signs at Daleville mentions some closures along the trail so best to get back home and do it again next year if the Shanghai shivers settle down. 
In summary, it was mostly hot, rained some, didn’t see many hikers until well into week two, awesome trails around the Triple Crown, saw lots of deer, had a good time.","Lamberts Meadow shelter
