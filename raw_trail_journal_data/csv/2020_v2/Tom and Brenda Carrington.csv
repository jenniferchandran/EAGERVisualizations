Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624784,"Hello again!
As in previous years we have dehydrated some of our favorites:  apples, pears, figs, peaches, tomatoes, cantaloupe, watermelon, and our traditional blend (carrots, cabbage, onions, and parsnips) -- a great addition to all of our just-add-water meals.  
After we complete our dehydrations, we will begin packaging our mail drops.
In early November, we plan on starting our adventure by hiking the Pinhoti Trails.  The Pinhoti Trails consist of a 171 mile long distance trail in Alabama (the Alabama Pinhoti Trail) connected to a 164 mile long distance trail in Georgia (the Georgia Pinhoti Trail), terminating at a point in north Georgia where it meets the Benton McKaye Trail which ultimately (after 72 miles) intersects the Appalachian Trail at a point only 0.2 miles from the Springer Mountain summit, the current southern terminus (and the beginning) of the Appalachian Trail.  The Pinhoti Trails, the Florida Trail, and the Appalachian Trail are part of a continuous footpath extending the length of the North American continent. a footpath named the Eastern Continental Trail by Nimblewill Nomad.
You are invited to join us, physically, or vicariously, as we share with you our emotional roller coaster journey from Flagg Mountain in Alabama to Katahdin Mountain in Maine.

Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624786,"Hello again and War Eagle!
We are almost ready to begin our adventure!
The Alabama Pinhoti Alliance, the source of our north bound Pinhoti Hike, outlines the hiking directions (the snail trail guides) for all thirteen sections of the trail in Alabama, and lists a referral to the Georgia Pinhoti Trail Association where the hiking directions of all the eighteen sections of the trail in Georgia can be downloaded.  
We have downloaded the 24 Alabama Pinhoti Trail maps, the 22 Georgia Pinhoti Trail maps, and the nine connector trail maps of the Benton McKaye Trail, linking the Pinhoti Trails to Springer Mountain.
When asked how did you get to Springer, we will answer we walked over 400 miles to get there.
Our connector trail hike from Flagg Mountain to Springer Mountain Georgia encompasses 31 hiking sections, 55 maps, and 407 miles.
As Nimblewill Nomad has so eloquently stated:
  ""It's a calling gone out to a fortunate few
To wander the fringes of God's hazy blue.""

Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624789,"The southern terminus of the Alabama Pinhoti Trail is located at Flagg Mountain in the Weogufka State Park in Coosa County, Alabama.  Flagg Mountain is the southernmost Appalachian Mountain that has an elevation higher than 1000 feet.  If you venture there you may have the good fortune to meet the venerable Nimblewill Nomad, who we consider one of America's National Treasures.
Nomad is a long distance hiking icon, having hiked the Triple Crown as well as all of the other designated National Scenic Trails and several historic trails in this great nation, and he is the current caretaker for Flagg Mountain and Weogufka State Park.  He is a soft-spoken, down-to-earth voice for the entire hiking community.  His I.D. card proclaims, ""Start your hike where the Appalachian Mountains begin.""
So - - We're starting our hike here.",,View Entry,"Nov 12, Tue",0

Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624995,"It was late Sunday afternoon when we arrived at the Flagg Mountain Trail Head, the official southern terminus of the Alabama Pinhoti Trail.  It was a perfect autumn day as we began out hike.  The climb up Flagg Mountain was challenging, a steep, winding stairway to the top.  The ground was covered with a mixed array of fallen leaves and pine needles, compounding our upward climb -- slippery, and slow and unknown.  The sounds of the afternoon were the rustling of the fallen leaves underneath our boots, the clicking of our hiking poles striking the ground, and the crunching of our packs against our bodies.  
At the very top of the mountain is a vacant tower, a fire lookout tower constructed in the 1930's by the CCC.  Slightly downhill from the tower are some cabins also constructed in the 1930's by the CCC and now lovingly restored by Nimblewill Nomad and staff.  
As soon as we arrived at the cabins we were cordially greeted by Nathan Wright.  He invited us to join him, his wife Kimm, the family Joneses, and Nimblewill Nomad for supper in the ranger's cabin.  Nathan and Kimm are in the process of developing a hostel in the area.  
While we were eating hotdogs and deviled eggs and drinking a cool bottle of water, Nimblewill prepared an adjacent room for us, setting up two cots.  The room was pleasantly warmed by a wall heater.  
As we sat around Nomad's beautifully-constructed dining table in the center of the room with a cheerfully burning fire in the fireplace, Nomad wanted to post us on his face book page and he christened us the ""Septuagenarian Professors.""  Not only has Nimblewill restored the cabins but he has also constructed tables, benches, and swings on the porches; the accommodations were quite comfortable.  
We had a wonderful evening with this group; they were hospitable, friendly, courteous, and full of stories.  They even graciously laughed at our total mileage this first day -- ONE MILE, yet they were respectable of our dream hike.",,View Entry,"Nov 17, Sun",0
Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624996,"Leaving the comfortable and inviting Flagg Mountain cabins, we continued down a two track for about one half mile before entering a woods trail going toward the first shelter on the Pinhoti Trail, the Weogufka Creek Shelter.  The trail was carpeted heavily with fallen leaves and pine needles.
On the way to the shelter we encountered some challenging, steep ravines, difficult for us to traverse.  This area is scenic with views of Weogulka Creek and the hills beyond.
Some areas of the trail appeared to be relatively newly constructed.  There were several different re-routes from our previous hikes through here.  
Due to Tom's falling several times we did not want to hike in the dusk so we stealth camped.",,View Entry,"Nov 18, Mon",0
Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625003,"This morning we continued on what appeared to be a recent re-route of the trail in this area; it was rough, steep and narrow; again compounded with rocks and roots under the leaves.  The trail passed through an area with young growth pine trees, loblolly and long-leaf varieties.  In a short time we re-entered the woods.  The trail was wide and easy, walking on a soft carpet of leaves and pine needles and it remained that way until we reached the roadwalk.  
A short distance later we came upon a bridge where we stopped to rest.  Brenda took off her pack and it immediately rolled down into the creek; fortunately it floated, and an unexpected fishing expedition followed.
We reached the road where we alternated walking between the pavement and the shoulder to avoid the traffic.  Of course, we were enthusiastically greeted by the neighborhood dogs.
To our surprise, Caperton General Store was open.  While drinking Dr. Peppers on the store porch Tom realized that he had lost his smart phone.  My goodness!  We will have to back track our steps to find the phone.  About two miles inside the woods, Brenda found the smart phone!  Whew!
Upon checking the phone (it still had power), we noticed the nursing home where Tom's ninety year old mother resides had been trying to reach us over the last few days.  We decided a quick trip home was needed to take care of her problem.
The surprises continue, but so does our walk.",,View Entry,"Nov 22, Fri",0
