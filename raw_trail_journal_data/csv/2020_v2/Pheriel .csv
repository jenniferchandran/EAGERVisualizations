Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627329,"2018 was full of hope and anticipation. After retiring on March 29 I started what was supposed to be a flip flop thru hike on April 7 at Daleville, VA. A foot injury near High Point State Park, NJ took me off trail for 3-4 weeks. Before heading north again my wife suggested staying closer to our home in case there was an issue so I completed from Franklin, NC to Hot Springs, NC. All was well so I leap frogged to Great Barrington, MA with the intention of getting to Mt. Katahdin then filling in all the remaining gaps by late fall to complete the thru hike. Well....I didn’t factor in the fall that led to injuring my lower back when I was south of Manchester, VT. This one took me off the trail and reluctantly changed me from a thru hiker to a section hiker. Total for 2018 ended at 909 miles. 
After 5-6 months of physical therapy I was finally ready to head back out in 2019 and hit the trail. There’s much less self-pressure as a section hiker and although the plan was to finish it didn’t work out that way. What was accomplished was connecting all the dots on the miles missed between Franklin and Great Barrington plus the miles from Franklin to Tesnatee Gap, GA. In all 2019 added another 707 miles. 
So for 2020 I’ll finish the 538 miles from Manchester, VT to Mt. Katahdin, head home to North Carolina to regroup then off to Tesnatee Gap to finish the last 37 miles to Springer. So it’s been back to training as my July start date approaches. Hopefully we’ll be beyond the coronavirus threat by then and all hikers will have to worry about is norovirus. Hope toilet paper is readily available by then because I’ve got to believe corn cobs are hard to pack...",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Wed",0
Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627335,"There are a few avenues for getting a  trail name. In the years leading up to my 2018 hike I’d heard some interesting names while doing many long weekends on the trail. It seemed that the more unusual ones like Small Furry Animal and PBS(Peanut Butter and Spam..guess you’ll eat anything with hiker hunger!) were given by other hikers after hitting the trail. Once given you’re usually stuck with it.  For me, I came to the trail with one....Pheriel.  My sons, Christopher and Daniel, went hiking and camping with me when they were younger. So I created a trail name using the last part of their names. It’s like having them with me on the trail without having to feed them! My wife is an English teacher and said it wasn’t a real name. So I pointed out that with the name of some rappers I could call myself whatever I wanted. Besides, as long as it’s capitalized it’s a proper name so Pheriel it is. Much better than Upchuck...",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Wed",0
Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627346,"As a section hiker that’s completed over 1600 miles of the AT I’ve had time to refine my equipment set-up to my liking. My total weight without fuel, food and water is a less than 16 pounds. Not exactly ultralight but a good mix of weight and luxury(not sure how much luxury you can have under 16 pounds!). As with most hikers I’ve used a variety of equipment and even changed backpacks, tents and sleeping bags from what I started with in 2018 to what I finished my section hike with in 2019. The big three transitioned from an Osprey pack, Big Agnes tent and a Nemo bag to getting all 3 from ZPacks. With the change my total weight and my cash flow both dropped substantially! The current set-up is what I’ll use on the trail this year. But, are hikers really ever satisfied with their gear? No. The only item I’m experimenting with right now is my pad. For years I used a Thermorest Zfold. Practical with easy set-up but not as comfortable for a tired, aching, aging body. Then it was the REI Flash which was more comfortable and fairly easy to inflate but after the second one was returned for going flat in the dead of night I went with the Thermorest NeoAir. On the comfort scale it gets high marks but it’s a noisy pad and I almost hyperventilate while blowing it up after a long day of hiking. So for 2020 I just bought the Exped Flex Mat Plus. More cush than the Zfold with all its simplicity but no noise and no passing out in camp. Hopefully this one will do the job. To be continued I’m sure.",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Thu",0
Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629163,"This is when I should be starting in Manchester, VT for my final 575 miles. But instead I’m sitting at the picnic table in front of Iron Mountain Shelter in Tennessee getting a hiking “fix” and updating my TJ. After all the physical preparation, tweaking my equipment and actually traveling to VT last week with my wife I made the absolute last minute decision to postpone completing my hike until 2021. It’s not due to my concerns about Covid but because of the impact Covid is having on the closing of some of the support systems in the northeast along the AT. Looking at those uncertainties I just wasn’t at peace with restarting the hike. And for those of you who are out there pressing on I wish you all blessings and get ‘er done! So, after a great NOBO road trip, eating some tasty food, buying some local maple syrup and seeing outstanding scenery I’m going to now be part of the larger than normal group of hikers that’ll be out there next year. Peace to all and be safe!","Up and back

Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645149,"Plans do change. COVID made me postpone until 2021 completing my final 575 miles of the AT. Then the stress fracture I’ve been nursing since 2018 finally became a full on fracture in late November 2020. Surgery was done in February with an expectation in my mind that I’d quickly recover, rehab and be hiking back on the AT in July as planned. But reality has a way of humbling a person and it soon became apparent that getting back to the AT this year wasn’t going to happen. So I’m resetting my target to July 2022.In the meantime I’m looking to fulfill my long(er) distance hiking fix for this year by doing a SOBO thru hike of the Pinhoti Trail. I’ll start October 24 and keep hiking south until it’s time to go to Mom’s house for Thanksgiving. I’ll set up a Trail Journals page in the Pinhoti Trail tab if you’d like to follow along.",,View Entry,"Oct 14, Thu",0
