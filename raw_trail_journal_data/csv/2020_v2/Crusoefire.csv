I already envy the people I see posted with start dates coming up, not sure I envy some that just started with the weather the way it has been.I spend countless hours researching equipment, and journals of people that have completed it, each one to a ""T"" says its an adventure of a lifetime. The hard days and down days seem to melt away with the Katahdin sign in front of them...I know the statistics, only about 30% of NoBo's complete it, less for the SoBo's.I am compiling gear, planning on doing a 30 mile VA section this spring as a dry run and can't wait to put boots on the ground!Hail to the Trail for all of you adventurers starting this year!","

I find each post seems to have a nugget, or something to glean. Maybe not every post but lets be positive right?
I am very excited about 2015 and have to remind myself not to look past 2014 and the camping memories I will make with my family this year, I have countless hours logged in research of gear, and bet practices. I know I'm not telling you other 15 ers anything you aren't experiencing, so this is for family and friends that may be reading later.
I am contemplating carrying a lite tent as well as my hammock, anyone else out there done this or considered it? If so let me know results or what you think!

They also mentioned the anticipation of larger than normal crowds next year...That being said I apologized for my hasty response, and post scripted, asking if that anticipation was due to the rumored Walk in the Woods movie actually coming to fruition?

I believe it got down in the 30s, still looking for that data, it was 42 when I woke at 530. I had a few times where the quilt (3/4 length) slipped and hit some cold spots but I had down sleeves and down jacket to slide under me. So all in all I'm comfortable with that temp range. Perhaps if it drops further I will be ok wearing another layer. On one other note the sniveller quilt has tape or velcro to form the foot box, it kept pulling apart slightly and snagging my wool socks, minor irritation.I did make the mistake of changing setup of one hammock strap while putting it up and didnt pre test it before sitting on the hammock...bad idea...

Since we start late i also don't want to boil water for oatmeal, meet a fit that hiked last year "" Fuego"" had cereal and dried milk in a bag n just added water, gonna try that as a quick alternative for breakfast. Colt made the shelter and moved a mile or 2 past to gooch gap looking for trail magic, he called me and said he found ""Captain"" from Pennsylvania who made a walmart run and got us 2 cokes, some beer and 2 gallons of water! Plus he was cooking hotdogs and had pizza, candy, thanks Captain! That's the 3rd trail magic so far, starting with an old Milwaukee in the springer parking lot from a couple of past thru hikers.Pitched camp there started late again lol.","

I only paused @the top of the mtn for 5 mins since I didn't have a camera and I was over an hr behind my projected time.Great vistas, but starting down the rock face with the blazes painted on the ground was a bit confusing because there were so many side trails, a few weeks ago an older guy named Lucky tried coming off near dusk with no light n snow on the rocks and couldn't see the blazes, last the trail and he got frost bite before he got off the mtnComing off blood mtn was brutal, I'm going to start calling myself "" Edward trekking poles"" instead of 'Edward scissor hands' Anyone thinking they don't need trekking poles think again.

Crusoefire,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/487670,"Colt 45 and I hit Clingmans Dome and since it was going to be his 22 birthday went into Pigeon Forge to celebrate. First thing, don't try to catch a ride with the tourists from the tower at Clingmans, they have lots of questions about your thru hike (and interest) but not too willing to give you a ride. I can understand though considering how rough we looked after slogging thru the rain, mud and trails that turned into creek beds.Just a note, the 6.9 miles from Spence Field to Derricks knob shelters are THE WORST miles of the trip so far! At least if it has rained, treacherous trails. rock climbs, bogs, it was harder than the boulder fields at Unicoi gap or blood mountain. Looking back even the 13 0r 14 miles to Clingmans was easier.Back to the dome, I called a shuttle service, none available, I check in the visitors center, the guy there wasn't overly friendly and said none ever came up there. So we went out to the parking lot to figure out the plan, when an gentleman stopped and asked us if we were looking for a ride! (his daughter and her family had overheard the gift shop conversation and she asked her dad if he would mind giving us ride!) Turns out they were headed to Pigeon Forge!! wow what birthday magic could Colt 45 bring us!it turns out much moreTHe old mill restaurant was an hour and halI apologize, I think the couples name was MIke and Judy (sorry if I got it wrong)...from Michigan rode down in a new suburban to Pigeon Forge stayed at the Laquinta hotel on Emert St there. (Aboslutely the BEST hotel Staff I have ever met STAY HERE!) I wanted to take Colt45 to the Old Mill Restaurant for his birthday. After a long day traipsing around town we went to Old Mill Square and the restaurant was packed with a wait time of 1.5 hour it was already 8pm, the Pottery Café across the street was supposedly 45 min wait. So we got a pager and went to the Old Forge moonshine distillery, Chris Blanton is the owner and we ran into him after being there a few minutes, talked about the hike, the fact it was Colts birthday and our pager went off... We started out the door and Chris said he was going to walk across the street with us to the café. He ended up talking to the owner there and told her to send him our dinner bill!! Southern Hospitality trail magic to the MAX!! Thanks Chris!Don't let the word ""café: fool you its got a full on dinner menyu and I had the BEST chicken livers I have ever had. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RESTAURANT! best food in town in my opinion. And I don't just say that because we got it free.Any way thunder and lightening storms today so we zero, and it clears tomorrow. back to the trail after what should be one of the most memorable birthdays of Colt45s life. The national park isn't one of my favorites in terms of staying at the shelters, the free air mattress I picked up in the hiker box at neals gap has slow leak so I have to blow it up every hour, we did see a bear the first night in the park, he circled our campground about 50 yards up the hill checking out our food bags. Sam Ducharmes 2015 hike on youtube has video of it as does colt on his facebook. I had just walked to the fire and left my phone in the hammock when I spotted the bear and he was going towards my hammock so I didn't want to head back that way to get it lol.Hope all of our friends ahead and behind us are doing well, and the ones that got off the trail.

Crusoefire,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/488953,"So a continuation on Trail Tips....On the hiking poles, #3. DO NOT lean them against a tree on the 'downhill' side of trail when you stop! The will sprout legs and one will try to commit suicide by falling away from the tree and down the hillside for you to retrieve..hopefully not hundreds of feet...4. Weight lifting gloves are a plus when using the poles, they keep blisters from forming between your thumb and index finger while gripping the pole for 7 or 8 hours.Cheap poles work as well to keep you from face planting as those carbonfiber millionaire poles you are contemplating buying.5. air mattresses left in hiker boxes probably werent left there because they are perfect... the one i picked up in neals gap didnt go flat until you laid on it for 45 minutes, finding this out while sleeping in a tiny tent in the rain is not the most desirable of conditions.6.flavor counts, if you are going to pack 4 or 5 days of food up one mountain and down another, make sure it tastes good.7. i hATE TO CLEAN my cook pot especially if i had something stick to the bottom, so... cook in freezer bags then toss in the woods... JUST KIDDING I DO NOT DO THAT! but freezer bags are a good way to just boil the water you need in the pot and keep it clean.8. you cant do BIG miles early, hell you can only do them if a: you have something you really want to get to....like a shower andb: you HAVE to stop and eat a really good lunch for that 2nd push if you are going to hit 15 or 16 or 20 miles before your trail legs are fully there.9.The Smoky Mtn National Park has some beautiful scenery or at least the half I could see did, the scenery doesnt outweigh the crappy shelter system. (The shelters are ok, the way they work with reservations sucks)10. GORP is useless weight, DONT CARRY IT.. you cant eat it while you walk, you need the hiking poles in your hands to keep your teeth in your mouth,( to keep from falling) and you dont really want it when you stop because you are hungry and want something filling. SO LEAVE it at home future hikers, its a good idea for a weekend hike around home but not the AT.I will stop here so I can remember to just do 11 -20 the next time.","Hot Springs

Crusoefire,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/489921,"So... I will start with the fact that I waited an extra day for a postal pkg that never showed in Hot Springs, I tried to arrange it to be bumped to Erwin, we shall see.WARNING!! If you are coming into Hot Springs and see coupons or advertisments for slack packing with Hemlock Hollow, ADVOID it like the plague,its isnt just me, its sloppily arranged, they take your credit card info which you would think is verifying thast you indeed are slackpacking... but apparently this is not the case. We got there and they hadnt picked up our packs, ok, no biggie they are going to get them...BUT everything about the experiene seems to put the owner/son/staff out, heavy sighs, inner family bitching, and overpriced. I am not alone in the opinion, every hiker I talked to the day after being there said they had the WORST experience here. The food was ok, but they add 15% gratuity for soe reason...not for the smiling service, not worth the $150 experience for 2 hikers! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME or MONEY. They are saying its up for sale, and next year want to close the cafe, they should do so on all fronts, I hate to pan an establishment and rarely do, but if you read this and still go, consider yourself warned.LLaurel Creek Trading Post (where our packs were dropped off is 19 miles from Hemlock) these guys were great, picked us up in Devils Gap, I got in late the kitchen was closed but he fixed me a cold cut sandwch, and the lady working there was truly an example of southern hospitality. I do have to warn you of the bunks which im sure the owner will upgrade, there are two that have plywood the the other 4 are covered in chicken wire with a thin pad, not a problem since you can throw your air mattress on them but on the top bunks you are at risk for falling off easily. Also its a hard climb up to that 6 ft level for some old tired bones, the other warning is the chicken wire has sharp ish points on the side towards the wall and i was at constant risk of tearing a hole in my very expensive jacks r better top quilt and thermoball jacket.So after a couple of hours i climbed down and sat at the table with my head buried in my top quilt on the table... that created the problem of cutting the blood flow to feet and legs afterseveral hours resulting in a calf that was at least twice the size of the right one, kind of scary actually.My tip for the day ASK for detailed reciepts at these hostels, after doing the math on paying for myself and Colt 45 at a hostel (any hostel), and their food, and a shower and laundry and anything else they can charge you for, as well as sharing sub par sleeping accomodations 
{addendum: after consideration, and a couple of other experiences with this transplanted pittsburgh native at the Laurel creek trading post, just AVOID this place also, I have felt what i call ""The Hiker Squeeze"" several times on this trail and this guy is one of them. There are people here who genuinely want to help hikers and only ask for fair compensation in return. Then there are others that think we are a moving gold mine and so far those people have mostly not been from the south. {transplanted northerners} They are only in it for the money and are quickly gaining a rep for that among us...so a warning to those exact people: ""We have duly noted your attitudes and are passing the word thru thru the hiker vine...no more of our money!!""]}
I am better of getting a hotel room if one is available, clean towels queen beds, cable, wifi, laundry for about 3 bucks, and generally 60 to 70 dollars for a night of quiet clean sleeping!Laughing Heart Hostel (hot springs) has been the exception so far, Tye Dye is currently managing it, she is a peacful good soul an the entire experience makes me recommend it heartily.","Hot Springs

Except coming into the Trimpi shelter out of damascus/mt rogers, a blister developed right where the hell rolls under to the base of the foot, which caused me to walk on the ball of my foot the next day and develop cramps in my arch and calf....ouch.Advice for non purist: Slack pack when possible and affordable, it gives your joints a rest and the way i see it is, 2000 miles is 2000 miles regardless of the weight you are carrying. To the purist..what difference does it make to you how i hike my hike? if i were an ultra light sub 20 hiker would you still have that opinion? (that last part is for someone ive met on the trail who bitches about slackpackers, oh well)Seen several snakes, one was in a bad mood when I moved him off the trail to get by, one was a BIG fat black snake right past the one room schoolhouse in Atkins where the trail magic was yesterday.I met Lonestar on the trail into Atkins she is going to help[ look for my 'still lost' postal package when she gets back to erwin,(she was sobo to damascus for trail days) thanks Lonestar and Ms Janet who also lives there. it took 2 weeks for a 2 day priority pkg to go from hot springs to erwin!! post office informed me they have 5 days to deliver the 2 day pkg, unless... you send it 2 day express ""priority"" for more money... Well hint usps, UPS sends it GUARANTEED 1 day for about the same price as your not guaranteed 5 day!!! Lets see, my new black diamond tip for my $30 new balance trekking poles lasted way less than the original ones. I had the outfitter in hot springs tell me i was going to break those cheap poles and would be better off moving up to a good pole/ turns out the poles have lasted 600 miles but the black diamond replacement tip only lasted a 100 or so...hmmm So, go to TARGET buy the new balance poles and save yourself a LOT of money!We are going back to trail days this week, meeting my family i hope we have good weather, maybe do the biking thing on the creeper trail.We lost a couple of hikers in or right after Damascus, Conductor got off, it was no longer fun for him, and if the mental part isnt there then its best to recognize it and avoid the torture. Hope youre having fun kayaking conductor! i know papa Al will miss ya, and Philco left, I didnt get to know him well but his hiking buddy Forrest will be missing him also.My tips this entry:1. you can do with less than you think, send it or leave it home, at the worst you will have to endure maybe 3 days before you can replace it or send for it. and you wont have to haul it up and over rocks, roots and mountains to to determine it wasnt really important.2. Make friends, be sociable, learn about the people on the trail, and DO IT EARLY AND OFTEN! This time only comes once in your life, if you normally have a bad attitude or outlook towards life change it! (not me lol)You know if you do and there isnt a place on the trail for it, make this your life changing moment! (ive met 1 or 2 whom this is for)3.Pack something up the mountain out of a town as a reward, my fave so far has been ORANGES, they are so much sweeter when you crest a ridge, sit down and cut it open with the view!4. The ""best italian"" (thats the name of it ) in Gatlinburg lives up to its name, eat there and get the garlic rolls, also some of the best spaghetti and meatballs ive had. Need to mention VITO's in Franklin he will pick you up and take you back for free, have to have cash for the food though, great food it is!Ok thats about it for now, if you would like to see pictures check out my FB page Ron VanBibber,(crusoe-fire) or Colton VanBibber (colt45) we can post them there much quicker thatn trail journals.Friend me if you like, and if you live north of damascus come do some trail magic lol, if you want, its (trail magic) fewer and farther between lately.Woke up breathin...","Atkins VA

I actually have the permanent one in my bag my wife brought to trail days, so anyone have suggestions for a dentist in or after Roanoke, maybe Waynesboro would be great. The problem with Roanoke is its Memorial Day weekend and I cant hang around till Tuesday.Lets see as for the trail, I highly recommend stopping at the Captains along the trail, I wouldnt exactly call the creek crossing a zip line, (i had to pull most of the way) of course i had my pack on the seat alsoand the cable was a little messed up but anyway the Captains was great.COLD soda on the back porch, charging stations on the front porch, wifi and free camoping in the yard! I tried to give him some money for resupply and he said NO' just pay it forward!That my friend,s is what the TRAIL should be, and a fine example of trail magic. so plan your hike sections out of Pearisburg to end up there, its well worth it.On other fronts i sent my top quilt and north face jacket home too soon apparently, the last 3 nights in my hammock were COOOLD! i spent the next night in Sarver shelter to eliminate the underdraft, (btw its a long ways down to the shelter but it is a very good shelter with a covered porch and water is a bit shallow) anyway it was even colder that night. I had to coverup with my 3/4 underquilt, and then used my hammock as a blanket to cover the rest of me. lesson learned, mid MAY is TOO SOON to drop all the warm layers! ALSO: DO NOT USE THE HOT SPRINGS POST OFFICE TO BUMP BOXES!! I lost mine, from there to Erwin, and have heard of at least 3 others that had problems with that post office.For anyone that was on the trail and met my son, 'Colt 45' he got off in Pearisburg, had the physical part of it down easy, just the mental part of dealing with the trail I guess... When people asked him if he was having fun, his reply was: ""Except for the walking!"" Another trekking pole tip: If you are first to break trail in the morning do not walk with your head down while swinging the pole in the air to clear spider webs in front of you, because you WILL poke the end of the pole into a tree and then run your chest directly into the other end of the pole, nearly impaling yourself on the handle... just a guess really, I wouldnt be stupid enough to do that...sigh...Knees are important tools on trail, take care of them, hike before you lose them, and future hikers, more importantly than practice hiking... S.T.R.E.T.C.H!!!! You will thank me for the advice, I promise.I understand Dusty Pilgrim is back on the trail, in the Roanoke area, so perhaps I will catch him.Virginia has some great views and ridiculous PUDS, but it is what it is, I think I am developing a new outlook, a different point of view on life, its in its infancy and hard to express, perhaps this is the beginnings of what the trail does for (or 'to') you.I find I just seem to accept what transpires a bit easier, and move on, and start each day saying ""thank you Lord for the day youve given me"" Rain or shine, its another day I have to live, learn and love.Woke up breathing....","headed north in VA

A tiny lil blister can hurt like a #%*€. It was right where the heel starts to roll under which meant I wasn't putting my heel down when walking and would basically step only on the ball of the foot which caused other problems....waaahhh... Nuff whining.Hadn't felt last 3 toes on either foot for a while, good long while, worried it was neuropathy, especially after running into a vascular surgeon near James river section and thought I should get checked.(diagnosis was it was just repetitive motion injury) Anyway, for whatever reasons i decided to exit the trail, and became a section hiker, a long section hiker at least.my wife came down to Lexington we did some trail magic right before the priests said goodbye to bean counter, Sam I am, and some others. I missed catching Dusty pilgrim, might not ever have caught him actually but I had some great times hiking with he and Sam.I want to go north in August and do a section with Sam if possible to keep up with him by then lol, wondering where papa al is also. I still stand behind my advice to future hikers, don't worry so much about practicing with a heavy pack, more importantly, STRETCH DAILY AND seek out someone online that has completed AT and see how their pack loadout changed over time on trail, but either way limit your miles till you are well into VA. Don't try to crank them up too fast.Your ""trail legs"" become a combo of miles hiked, weight lost, mental toughness gained, and weight reduction in your pack load by sending winter gear home. I sent home warm layers a bit too early, probably 2 or 3 weeks early.I met some great people, some different people and....ahhh some characters on the trail, wouldn't trade the experience for anything!

Crusoefire,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624984,"Hello, there are some that know I started a thru hike march 2015, I made it to Lexington Va and got off trail with a knee problem, as well as the Virginia blues mental shortfall. My 21 year old son had started with me and decided to leave the trail after Damascus, this was a blow to the morale even though we rarely hiked together, since his pace was more suited to ""Speedy Gonzalez's"".But enough of the past and ruminations, what lies before me is the question of starting where I left off in Va. as a 'Lash' and becoming what I call a ""Two Hiker"" ( finished in 2 try's) or... begin again and thru hike it.The thing I cherish most about my 2015 adventure is the many friendships I formed and have to this day almost 5 years later, if I start in Virginia, I deprive myself of that facet of the trail... at least it appears that way from this vantage point.I am a much more experienced hiker, smarter (hopefully) and have learned how to get my base weight down... waaay down, which will definitely extend my ability to complete the trail.I hate leaving something incomplete, and have run the gamut of not caring if I ever get back on the trail to, regaining some of that pent up excitement some of you are building towards at this very moment concerning your own hikes.I have set out some very specific conditions (some are my wife's conditions, which is paramount to success)1. I have to implement a rigid stretching program this winter, this will most certainly be the most important thing any of us could do2. I must reduce my body weight by 10%, again, this will help the knees longevity.3. I walk / hike all the time, but I want to up my miles gradually in order to be in full trail legs shape when I start.4. I have to wait until spring sports season is near completion, my youngest son runs track and it is too difficult for my wife to get him to all the practices and meets by herself. Valid point.5.i have some homeowner to do lists that I want completed to free my mind of worry..That's pretty much it, I think there are improvements I can make in hiking as a replay,that include not getting sucked into zeroes too often, and doing only neros. Not carrying too much water, ( that my fear packing) they say you pack your fears and I would always fill up on water unnessecarily...Well that's enough ramblings for a first post.",,View Entry,"Nov 21, Thu",0
