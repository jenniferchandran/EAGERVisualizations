Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627102,"We are Bill and Monty Chipman, known on the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail as ""Fixit"" and ""Third Monty."" We thru-hiked the PCT twice, in 2005 and 2010, then the CDT in 2016.  
We had not planned to do the Appalachian Trail. ""It's way back East,"" we said. ""It's mostly green tunnel, with lots of rocks."" ""It has way too many people."" ""It has lots of ticks and mosquitoes and horrible humidity.""
But when we finished the Continental Divide Trail, we couldn't help it. We started thinking, ""Triple Crown."" And not just an ordinary Triple Crown. If we can pull off a thru-hike of the AT, that will mean Fixit gets to join a very exclusive ""club"" called ""Triple Crown AT AGE 70 AND ABOVE"".
That's one of the major reasons WHY we are headed for the AT. But there are some other reasons, too--the same reasons that led us to hike the PCT and CDT.
STAY IN SHAPE, physically, mentally and spiritually. Most people our age (Fixit is 80; 3rd Monty is 72) are on multiple prescriptions, and hobbling around with knee problems, hip problems, etc. We did NOT want that to ever happen to us, so we've worked very hard at staying in shape, physically. And mentally, there is nothing like the challenge of doing a long trail. Studies have shown that thru-hikers who FINISH are those who maintain MENTAL strength. And then there is the spiritual side. Fixit and I are both Christians. That means we have had a genuine encounter with Jesus Christ, Who is God Himself. He has come into our lives and transformed us from the inside out, and now we love Him and live for Him above all else. Doing a thru-hike gives us a chance to ""walk"" with Him and experience His presence and His love in ways that just aren't possible in ""civilization."" Over and over again, we have seen Him taking care of us in a way that only He could.The satisfaction/joy of living simply, with just ""the basics."" There is nothing that can beat being able to just walk all day, carrying everything that you REALLY need and nothing that you don't, and just thoroughly enjoying every moment, even the moments that are cold, wet, scary and uncomfortable. I always say, ""The only thing I miss is being able to just turn on a faucet to get water."" The beauty of the mountains, the forests, the deserts, etc. We love being able to get away from town and into the world of the trail. The huge views, the incredible beauty of the backcountry, simply cannot be seen from a car on a highway, and not even from a dayhike. We feel sorry for hikers who cannot let go of their artificial stimulations of electronics, recorded music, etc. We love to hike and hear the wind, the water, the birds, etc. Opportunities to meet people we would otherwise never meet. This applies both ON the trail and OFF the trail. While we are ON the trail, we have met fellow ""hikertrash"" from all over the world. We get to hang out with them, hike with them, talk with them. It is an amazing experience. And OFF the trail, we find that our thru-hiking story has often opened up a door of communication with people who would otherwise not listen to us. We get to eat EVERYTHING and LOTS of it! At home, we are careful to match calories to how much exercise we are getting. On a thru-hike, part of the challenge is to stay ahead of the calorie deficit, so we don't end the hike looking like Holocaust survivors. That means we get to EAT, and EAT and EAT, everything we want. It is a lot of fun!We'd love to have you follow our journey--the only caveat is, Fixit and I (3rd Monty; I'll be doing all the writing in this journal) are dinosaur ""technopeasants.""  So we won't be updating every single day and posting videos, etc.  Our method is that every night, I take a PEN and write on PAPER what happened for us that day.  When we reach a resupply, I SNAILMAIL the paper journal to my sister, who then will post it on our blog (montybillpct.net) and also here on Trailjournals.  Our photos will also be on the montybillpct.net blog, and they will only be added occasionally, since they are on a camera card that also has to be snailmailed.  Yes, it may be slower, but it works great, and we like it!We don't carry a bunch of electronics--only a cellphone that is stowed deep in the pack and only used for emergencies.  At home, that same cellphone lives in a drawer and is only taken out occasionally (like when we are going on a long trip and might need it for emergency use).  Fixt refers to cellphones as ""electronic dog leashes for people"", not to mention the health hazards of all those wavelengths going through your eyes and brain, and the obvious problem we see everywhere we turn of people being positively addicted to their cellphones.  No thanks!  We love the mountains and the woods and the critters and meeting other hikers.  Who needs electronics???  Not us!",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Sat",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627103,"OK, here goes! (This journal is being written by 3rd Monty, so when you see ""I"" , that's who it means)  We've been training for the AT (as we have trained for our 3 other thru-hikes) ever since October, but haven't been able to post anything till now (WordPress site had to be totally done over).  What you are reading here is basically copypasted from our WordPress site--the URL is :  montybillpct.net





So today we headed out for an all-day hike at one of our favorite places--Annadel State Park, near Santa Rosa. It's got big hills and LOTS of really rocky trail. We figure that's perfect for AT prep. I guess the rocks are different from AT rocks, though. A lot of them are lava/volcanic rocks from all the volcanic drama that happened around here 5,000 years ago or so. Hey, we still have hot springs and geysers, so it's not totally over yet!





For training purposes, we carry our old packs, loaded up with 20 lb. of ""odds 'n sods"". My pack is the one I carried on both of our thru-hikes of the PCT, but now it's ""retired"" and I use it for training. I made it myself, a la Ray Jardine, only I did add an external frame. (Sorry, Ray, but my shoulders are just not strong enough or big enough to carry a fully loaded pack without something to transfer the weight down to my hips).





Winter rains this year have been on the lower side of average, so although the grass is green, it's still pretty short. The trees are bare and leafless, but I love to study the tracery of the branches--each kind of tree has its own shape and patterns. The wild turkeys are out, but it's too early for any turkey chicks. It was a really cold (for CA) day--low 50's all day, with ice still on the puddles in the forest, even in the middle of the morning. We wore all our layers, all day, and ate lunch sitting out in the full sun, by Ledson Marsh, with its great view of Hood Mountain, listening to hawk cries from the tops of nearby trees. ( For some reason the hawks seem to like to hang out by the marsh and ""talk"" to each other.) 





It was a glorious day.",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Mon",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627104,"The continuing drought here in Northern California has been really hard--we are saving every bit of water we can, to the point of saving even the water we ""run"" while waiting for the hot water to come through, and the rinse water from washing dishes. We collect this in buckets (there's a row of them in the kitchen and the bathroom), carry them outside, and use the ""saved"" water for our winter vege garden, which right now consists of snow peas, different kinds of lettuce, kale and leeks.
BUT, on the bright side, there is a trail we love to hike, but avoid in the winter because it is so awfully muddy--the Bolinas Ridge Trail. So today we decided ""Let's go for it!"" 
The trail begins with a steady climb up through cow pastures. We have to ""squiggle"" through a gate to start the trail, and say ""Hi!"" to the cows and calves as we pass by. (Sadly, their grass is barely growing). The higher we get, the more awesome the views, all the way back to Tomales Bay, where the San Andreas Fault makes its way into the sea. We call this part of the trail, ""The Sound of Music"" because that's what it looks like--the opening scene in the movie where Julie Andrews is singing about ""The hills are alive with the sound of music....""(Note: on our montybillpct.net blog we have pictures, and I have copypasted text only over to trailnournals.com)

Eventually we reach ""The Big Eucalyptus Patch"" where several huge ""euc's"" are growing by a spring. Finally we get to the top of the ridge and we are into the forest, full of ferns, and a wildlife camera (I always stop there and wave!) 
From that point on, it's a moderate rollercoaster of beautiful trail through redood forest and Douglas fir forest, with glimpses of San Francisco Bay to the east.Lunch was in the redwoods, leaning against a huge tree. All these redwoods are second growth (originals were logged in the late 1800's) but you would never know it--these 120ish year old trees are magnificent. 
Then we headed back to the car, muttering ""One of the best things about long distance hiking is NOT being 'on a leash' of having to 'get back'. We can just GO!"" Pretty soon we will be starting to count down the days till we CAN ""go""!",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Mon",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627105,"One by one, the ""big deals"" of preparing for the AT are getting done. But compared to our hikes of the PCT and CDT, we are being really slackers! For both of those, our garage at this point would be lined with numbered boxes, and we'd be starting to load them up with supplies.
All we have right now is an ""AT corner"" in our living room!
But the following ""big deals"" are now DONE deals:
Book airplane tickets. A look at ""when is the best time to book for the best price?"" made us realize that the time was NOW! Yikes! So we are flying out from San Francisco to Atlanta, nonstop, on Thursday, April 23. A good friend of ours even volunteered to take us to the airport. (Our original plan was to HIKE around 3 miles to the ""Airporter"" bus stop).Set up a ""Survivor Dave"" shuttle run to Amicalola State Park. We have heard so many good things about ""Survivor Dave"" that we figured we HAD to ride with him. He was a lot of fun to talk to on the phone, and was also VERY patient when our newly refurbished computer was giving us grief in trying to pay him. When we were all done, he said, ""OK, any questions? Comments?"" and I said, ""So, do we have to sign one of those I-am-not-responsible-if-something-bad-happens-to-you papers? For the CDT shuttle, we had to sign that if we got caught in the crossfire between Border Patrol and the drug runners, too bad so sad, the CDTA was not responsible."" Dave just laughed and said, ""Well, the only drugs around here are mostly meth and no Border Patrol.""Book a place to stay near Atlanta. Survivor Dave has a special deal with a hotel north of Atlanta. We will take the MARTA train, go to the hotel, and Dave picks us up from there. So I had the fun of calling up the hotel and asking for the ""Survivor Dave Hiker Rate."" It even includes breakfast, and Dave said, ""I'll pick you up at 7:00, April 24, but I'll come early and have some coffee with you!"" Sounds great!Freezedries. Unlike the PCT and CDT, where our resupply boxes included almost all the food we would need, on the AT we are only sending ourselves freezedried dinners (which we doctor up by adding things to, like dehydrated veges from our garden, etc.) So that means a BIG freezedry order from our absolute favorite supplier, LDPCampingFoods.com. They have great discounts. I don't know how they do it!Shoes. We both wear La Sportiva Ultra Raptors, and plan to go through 3 pairs of them in the course of the hike. So the ""shoe delivery"" has arrived, and we are currently using the brand new shoes for day hikes, to make sure they feel good. I've only once had a pair of trail runners that DIDN'T feel good, but that was enough to make me a bit wary. So now I test every new pair before putting them into a resupply box!",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Sat",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627106,"(Pictures for this entry are at montybillpict.net)Today was the first time in quite awhile that we were able to do a close to 8 hour hike. In December and January and early February, the days are too short to pull off a long hike. We need at least 1 1/2 hours of daylight at the end of the hike, so we are not trying to drive home in the twilight. We had a run-in with a deer one time and don't want a repeat of that experience. So that really cuts the hiking day pretty short in the winter. But today we figured we could go till a bit after 5 pm! Yay!
We were out at Point Reyes National Seashore, which is probably our top favorite place for hiking. Lots of big hills to climb, amazing views of the ocean, and the trails range from easy to fairly challenging. It was a clear, breezy, beautiful day, so we headed for the top of Mt. Vision, via the horse trail.  Spring has sprung--bushes and trees are just starting to leaf out. The willow trees have everything from ""jewels"" (buds that are round and swelling but have not opened yet) to catkins.There are a few flowers....and (sigh) the stinging nettles have sprouted. There are a lot of them out at Point Reyes, and they are probably the only bummer about the trails here.We could see the Farallones Islands way out at sea, and a bit of a fog bank way out there also. But the drought situation is BAD. The grass is green, but very stunted and has brown tips. The backcountry camps, which get their water from springs....well, we met a ranger who had to drive in with a tank of potable water, otherwise there would be no water at Sky Camp. I don't know how bad it is at the other camps.

At the end of the day (7 1/2 hours of actual hiking time) we both felt a bit tired, but good. We were carrying around 21 lb. each. We have learned that carrying weight is the key to training for a thruhike. And we also thought about all we need to get done before we leave on April 23. Yikes!",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Mon",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627107,"Daylight savings time has started here in California, and for us that meant ""Hooray, we can do THE LOOP out to the coast!"" During the winter, the days are too short and there just isn't time to do a 20 mile loop and finish with enough daylight left to make the drive home.

But some snafus happened first thing in the morning (unexpected things came up that required making phone calls and sorting out) so it was 9:30 am before we were at the Bear Valley trailhead at Point Reyes Nat'l Seashore. So we opted for a shorter version of ""The Loop"", and shouldered our ""training packs"" to head out.
Point Reyes in springtime is just beautiful. Everything is green, the earliest wildflowers are out, and the creeks are running. 
We did the moderate climb out of Bear Valley up to Divide Meadow (we call that part of the trail ""The Icebox"" because it is so COLD early in the morning) then to the junction with the Glen Camp trail, where we began the ""short loop"". This involves a very long and often steep climb up to where we finally get a ""view of the blue"" (the ocean) and then a long downhill to what we call ""Wild Kitty"" (Wildcat Camp). 
The ocean was very still--no wind, no whitecaps--and sadly, we could see offshore THREE large ships just sitting there. We figured they were cruise ships in quarantine because of the stupid coronavirus/Covid-19 thing.

We had lunch at one of our favorite spots--a perch high up on a cliff overlooking Wild Kitty and the whole coastline from Point Reyes and all the way south to where Alamere Falls comes tumbling over the cliff into the sea.

It is glorious. We scanned the ocean looking to see if there were any late migrating whales going by, but didn't see any. (There are times we can sit there and see lots of whale ""spouts"").

On the way back we met a guy with a Vermont ""Long Trail Patrol"" shirt on and said, ""Hey! We're headed your way this summer!"" Turns out that yes indeed, he DID do patrol work on the Long Trail and he has also helped on the AT. So that was kind of exciting to meet him!





But thanks to the virus thing, our order of freezedried food is on backorder (the folks at LDP foods are pretty frustrated right now) and Delta Airlines (we are flying Delta to Atlanta) sent us an email saying, ""No worries, you will be safe from the virus when you fly with us!"" It will be so good to get into the woods and forget about all that civilization stuff and face the much more down to earth challenges of the trail!",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Mon",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627108,"We got plenty of training on ""hills"" today, going up 'n down, up 'n down a LOT of stairs, because every Wednesday we are in charge of a Bible club for kids called ""AWANA"". Kids come from many different churches and some from no church, to have a chance to learn about how to know God ""for real"" and how to really know the Bible, plus have fun. 
So many kids today are in the situation of parents too frazzled and busy to really spend time with them or encourage them or help them. But we try to fill in that gap, with AWANA leaders who really love the kids and get to spend some one on one time with each kid to help them study and learn.
AND, we are so grateful that at ages 72 (3rd Monty) and 80 (Fixit), we can still run up the stairs two at a time and run around with kids.",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Wed",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627109,"The past few days we've been getting a flurry of emails from the headquarters of the PCT, the CDT and the AT, about COVID-19 and what they are doing about it. Their plans range from ""No volunteer trail projects for awhile and y'all be careful"" (PCT) to ""Sorry, folks, but we are shutting down our center in Harper's Ferry and cancelling big trail events"" (AT) to ""We hate to say this, but you should probably consider cancelling your 2020 thru-hike; many of the people in the trail towns are elderly and we don't want to put them at risk"" (CDT)
Our only concern is we hope they don't cancel airline flights between San Francisco and Atlanta on April 23. And to be honest, we are kinda hoping that the trail angels who show up along the AT with food for hikers will still be out doing their thing. We enjoy trail magic!
Here at home, we are highly amused at seeing people going out of local grocery stores with a load of......toilet paper! Fixit and I figure, ""Hey, if we have to, we'll just go into ""hiker mode"" when we have to go to the bathroom.""
""Hiker mode"" is: 1) GUYS don't need TP. Fixit does just fine with leaves and stones, occasionally assisted by a bit from his water bottle. 2) GALS (like me) have a bit of old bandana for what we call a ""pee rag"", which gets rinsed every day. It never gets stinky and is not a bit unhygenic. Then for TP, I personally find that on the trail, 2 squares a day of the thicker, tougher TP is all I need. I get maximum use from each square, then put the used ones into a plastic ""snack size"" ziplok. This little ziplok then is put into a quart size ziplok (that also has my UNused TP). I then carry this along till I get to a garbage can, and dispose of it.
Of course we always finish up with a bit of Purell, which we carry in a tiny travel-size container.
We are not at all freaked out by COVID-19. We went to church today and everyone was being careful to practice ""social distancing"" (6 ft) and there was no coffee hour to hang out with your friends and meet new people, but there was still joy, there was still laughter, there was still love and peace and the presence of God with us.
A Salvation Army officer friend of mine told me about her experience in helping people who had survived the horror and devastation of a severe tornado event a few years back. The people who were true Christians, who truly and for real knew Christ, were able to look at the monster tornado heading right at them and say, ""Well, Lord, You know where I am. I guess I'm coming home."" And then the tornado veered away and they said, ""Oh! I guess not. OK!"" They were at peace and thankful to still be alive. The people who were just religious or had no religion were STILL in shock and terror and trauma, days after the tornado. They had no spiritual resources.
It's the same thing with COVID-19. The people who know God, for real, can look at it and say, ""OK, I'll do my bit to help stop the virus from spreading, and I will do everything I can to help other people and encourage them and let them know that they CAN really know God, but if COVID-19 gets me and I die--I know I'll be going home to be with Jesus and that will be totally awesome!"" The others..... are huddled at home in fear. That is no way to live!",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627110,"Another all-day hike, this time to Annadel State Park near Santa Rosa! This is where we go for not just hills, but seriously rough 'n rocky trail. 
Driving toward Santa Rosa from where we live in Petaluma, we could see the mountaintops were dusted with snow, and brrrr, it was cold! When we headed out from the trailhead, we were wearing all our layers plus gloves.


Thanks to a bit of rain recently, the plants were really perking up, and the wildflowers are starting to bloom, though not with the size and vigor and profusion they usually have. Most blooms were rather small and sparse. I saw a lot of wild forget-me-not and the first of the shooting stars.


The route we like to follow includes a trail named ""Rough Go"" and that is a very accurate description! It's extremely rocky, and the rocks are mostly all volcanic. This whole area was once the scene of volcanic eruptions. Mt. St. Helena, just to the north and dusted with snow today, actually is a volcano, and even has a petrified forest at its foot. The many hot springs in this area are a pretty good indicator that ""it ain't over yet""; there is molten lava deep within the earth below us.


On really rocky trail, Fixit (Bill) just goes bopping along at full speed regardless, while I am picking my way and choosing where to put my feet down. The reason is that I've had several falls (one pretty bad) on the rocky trails in this park, and have learned that I just have to slow down. It is really frustrating when I know I COULD be going a lot faster, but dare not do it. Part of the problem is that I have really BIG feet in proportion to the rest of me, plus I have bifocal glasses, so if I look through the top of the glasses, the ground looks like it's waaaaaay far down, and if I look through the bottom part, the ground looks like it's at my knees. I depend a lot on my trek poles to let me know where the ground actually IS!


But aside from that, I love hiking here. There are so many different aspects to this park: tree-covered mountains (Douglas fir, all kinds of oaks & madrones & laurel, plus occasional redwood groves) as well as a lake and a marsh, and many lovely, open meadows. Today we saw many, many wild turkeys. It's pretty obviously the time of year when the boy turkeys are looking for girl turkeys! We heard gobbling off and on all day and saw many of the toms strutting their stuff. One of them looked like he was practicing--he would ""buff up"" and hold it for a few seconds, then go back to normal, then ""buff up"" again. He kept doing this over and over.


Annadel State Park is also a favorite destination for trail BIKE riders. We meet lots of them here! They are brave. You could not PAY me to go careening down these trails on a BIKE. We've stood by and watched as paramedics had to helicopter out a bike rider who wrecked his bike and himself. The medics told us that about once a week they have to go in and rescue injured bike riders. I believe it. These trails are rough & tough. I prefer HIKING them!


Our favorite lunch spot here is at Ledson Marsh, where we are practically guaranteed some good birdwatching--water birds in the marsh (a lot of geese today) and raptors as well as smaller birds.


Two years ago, during the awful fires near Santa Rosa, a large part of Annadel Park was burned. We went through some of the ""burn zone"" this morning, and the afternoon part of our hike today took us through a part where the burn was pretty bad. Almost all the trees were killed. Some are resprouting from their roots, but many magnificent oak trees are completely dead. It is so sad. You can tell how bad the fire was in any given area by looking at the tree trunks. In the badly damaged zones, the trees are black and burned all the way to their tops. In other areas, the black burned bark goes only partway up the trunk, and in other areas, there's a bit of black on the trunk, but only on one side.


But we really like seeing how everything is slowly recovering. There were even some oak trees that last summer looked dead, but this time, on maybe one small branch, they are sprouting a few leaves. Amazing!


Back home, we continued ""collating stuff for the AT"" and collecting boxes to put it in. I just finished drying a lot of slices of leeks and I'm crumbling them up into little bits to bring with us and add to our dinners on the trail. We are both feeling strong and looking forward to when the adventure begins",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Mon",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627111,"I've now received TWO very depressing emails from the AT Conservancy. Wow, are they in doom 'n gloom mode! Contrast that with the PCT Association, which is very upbeat. The PCT people sent an email today saying, ""Oh bummer, we've had to cancel our trail team maintenance projects for March and most of April--but NO WORRIES! We have a full schedule of projects in line for this summer!"" And their advice to PCT hikers is ""OK, you guys, you be careful and observe the guidelines about not bunching and all that, and have a great hike!""
What is with the AT Conservancy? 
The only concern I have right now is that after some bad experiences with mailing resupply boxes to post offices (limited hours that force you to wait in town plus overzealous postal workers that only keep a general delivery box for 2 weeks, then send it back), I now AVOID mailing to post offices. Problem: all our resupplies are at private businesses and hostels. From what the AT people are saying, sounds like those places are currently closing and hurting.
But we are not starting our hike till April 24, so I am going to wait a bit and then phone to find out who is open and who isn't. I may end up having to mail to some post offices. Sigh.
And yay for the PCTA! Those guys have a GREAT attitude!",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Wed",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627169,"Last night I decided to have a look at TrailJournals to see the reaction of current AT hikers to the doom 'n gloom ""get off the trail"" message of the AT Conservancy.
I looked at a lot of journals, and discovered that the responses fell into one of 3 categories. 1) Fear: these hikers were scared or even terrified at the thought of getting covid-19 and also very worried at the thought that there would be no ridgerunners or rangers out patrolling the trail. They have quit and gone home. 2) Oh well--I'll just wait a couple of weeks These hikers have done just that--gone home temporarily, while continuing to do training hikes to stay in shape. 3) Ain't nuthin' gonna stop me, no way: these hikers are just continuing on, with the reasoning that ""I'll have way less contact with other people if I just stay out here on the trail.""
Fixit and I are in category 3. As far as ""no rangers, no ridgerunners"", we are not a bit concerned. On the PCT in 2005 (before the movie ""Wild"" came out) we would often go for days in very remote wild country without seeing another human being. People would ask, ""Ooooh, isn't that scary?"" And we would raise an eyebrow and wonder, ""What's scary? It's really nice to have the whole backcountry to yourself!"" And no rangers? Some rangers are helpful (like rangers who looked for better places to cross roaring whitewater and marked them for the hikers) but many others are just annoying, like the ranger lady Fixit and I met one afternoon, on the PCT north of Tuolemne Meadows in Yosemite. Of course she wanted to see our permits, but then she demanded, ""Where did you camp last night?"" We said, ""Tuolemne Meadows"" (which was about 18 miles behind us). The ranger lady frowned. ""That's not possible"", she said. We replied, ""We are PCT thru hikers. Our minimum mileage per day is 25 miles, except when we were in the southern Sierras and it dropped to 19 or 20. We do 30 mile days if the trail is good. Yes, we really DID camp at Tuolemne Meadows last night!"" She frowned again, mumbled an OK and headed on. 
That's the kind of ranger we DON'T like to see.
Fixit and I have been having lots of practice lately in facing down tough situations. Here in Sonoma County, California, the last 2 years have thrown one stressful thing after another at us. First there was the awful fire in Santa Rosa (we know several people who lost everything in that fire); we were working with the Salvation Army to provide all kinds of things needed by the survivors. (I about wore myself out on that one and learned a good lesson about working in disasters: Take care of YOURSELF, too!)
One year later came the ""Camp Fire"" that destroyed the town of Paradise and even our home town of Petaluma was inundated with smoke for weeks. Fixit actually deployed with the Salvation Army (he is a sergeant) to help run a center for evacuees in the city of Chico.
Then this last fall, ANOTHER wildfire and 100's of thousands had to be evacuated in our own Sonoma county. Plus vast areas had all their power shut off. Our own town of Petaluma was mostly shut off (our house was OK; we were in a little ""island of light' in the middle of a sea of darkness at night), and even the evacuation center where we deployed with the Salvation Army was running on generator power.
So we've had one tough, stressful event after another. Facing down this kind of thing is not fun, but wow, it sure gives us the opportunity to rely on God and not on ourselves. One of the biggest lessons we have learned on our three thru-hikes is that God really does care about us. One of the ""colorful characters"" of the PCT is Joe Anderson of ""Casa de Luna"". He lets hikers camp in his large yard (the ""Magical Manzanita Forest"") and he and his wife Terri feed everybody, too. We were hanging out with Joe & Terri and the other hikers in 2010, when Joe said, ""Lissen up, you guys! I get to hear a LOT of your 'trail magic' stories about how amazing things would happen when you needed something or you were in trouble. Well, lemme tell you--don't give me that BS about 'magic.' Give credit where credit is due--it's GOD. Because He really does care."" Fixit and I cheered a hearty ""Amen, Joe!"" 
So we are still packing boxes and training every day, and we still do plan to hike the AT!",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Fri",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627213,"Yesterday I spent a couple of hours on a training hike at Helen Putnam Park. Fixit did not join me this time, because he's recovering from a minor medical procedure that was SUPPOSED to have been done a couple of months ago, but the doctor kept procrastinating. He should be fine in a couple of weeks.
The park has been renovating several of its trails, which were getting a bit gullied and ""slumped"". I was able to walk on some of the renovations, including a whole new reroute that avoids a rather steep, messed up, old section of trail. Since Fixit and I were on a PCT trail maintenance crew a few years ago, and we got to learn a lot about building and caring for trails on that trip, I now have much more understanding and experience for looking at any trail maintenance and renovations I come across.
Being on a trail maintenance crew is an awesome experience! I highly recommend it!
Because Petaluma is under the ""shelter in place"" rule, and all ""unneeded"" businesses are closed, there were a lot more folks on the trail than usual, and I was able to do a lot of ""people-watching."" Some people are so fearful that they literally are huddling in their homes and not even going out for walks (and hysterically criticizing those of us who do go out and saying we should be jailed!!!), but I would say the majority of Petalumans are being cheerful and making the best of things.
There is a rule about ""six feet away"" from other people, and on a fire road trail, that's do-able, but on a narrow footpath, it's not. There are lots of narrow footpaths at Helen Putnam Park. So what almost all of us did was keep to the right as best we could and pass quickly with just a wave and a smile. But there was one couple I met whose behavior was really sad. They were hiking towards me on a narrow footpath. I moved as far to the right as I could, and expected them to do the same. Instead, they suddenly started RUNNING off the trail, up the hill into the grass, and as I passed, they yelled at me angrily. I was thinking, ""Are they crazy? That grass is full of ticks!"" (Which is why I did NOT move completely off the trail into the grass). I hurried by while they yelled and I wondered. Finally I realized, ""Oh, duh, they wanted ME to move OFF the trail about 3 feet, then THEY would move OFF the trail about 3 feet, and that way we could keep the 6-foot distance. And then we would BOTH have to stop and do a tick check.""
The other thing I noticed was a family of dad and 2 kids, one a 6 year old-ish girl and her big brother (I'd say he was about 8 or 9). They were just starting up what we call ""The Face"", a long, steep hill that is greatly loved by Petaluma runners, who come there to train. The boy saw the hill, and being a boy, started to CHARGE up it! I cheered and said, ""Go, go! Way to go!"" Boys LIKE a challenge! They like to take it on! But little sister stopped and began a piercing, whining cry of ""Wait for me! Wait for me!"" Big brother ignored her. Little sister made no attempt to keep up, just stood and whined. Finally the dad made big brother come all the way back, and little sister looked triumphant. I was horrified. Little sister was being trained to be a selfish control freak. A far more sensible arrangement would be to say ""Big brother, once you get to the top, wait up!"" That way he would be able to do what every boy needs to do--meet big challenges--while at the same time, practice reasonable courtesy. And little sister should NEVER be allowed to whine and control, but instead be encouraged to do her best, with the idea that if she is diligent to work hard and run and climb, someday she ALSO will be able to charge up a big hill!
Well, I went up and down The Face myself, a couple of times, figuring ""There will be a lot of this on the AT!"" And I want to be ready to face that challenge!",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Sat",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627339,"Taking a look at hiker journals and blogs....seems like most (not all) of the hikers are bailing off the trails and going home, for fear of spreading the coronavirus.We still plan to go for our AT hike on April 24.  Hopefully by then some of this hysteria will have died down.  There are many medical doctors (I've read some of their communications to their patients) who are basically saying:  1) Take care of yourself--eat right, take good vitamin supplements, get exercise & sunshine, plenty of water and enough sleep.  Wash your hands a LOT.   2)  DON'T WATCH THE NEWS!  It is spreading a lot of misinformation, designed to create fear.  It is NOT good for your MENTAL health. 3) Do the social distancing thing as best you can.   Your chances of getting coronavirus are VERY VERY small.Even the PCT people have joined the ""get off the trail, you might be spreading the virus!!!!!"" panic.  We have hiked the whole PCT twice.  Many times we went for days on end without seeing another person.  And the PCT has no shelters where hikers congregate.  On the AT, our plan is to hike the same way we did on the PCT and CDT:  AVOID CAMPING where other people camp.  And a run into town to pick up a resupply box and grab some food--that can be done ""to go"".  We don't have to sit down in a restaurant.  We would be doing that sort of thing even staying at home and going to the grocery store and running errands.  For us to stay home would not lessen our ""chance of spreading the virus"" one little bit.Meanwhile, here in Sonoma County, where we live, they had the same problem as the poor AT people seem to be having--with so many people out of work, they head for the trails to go hiking. (Here, it's trails and BEACHES).  Result: way, way more people on trails and beaches than there would normally be.  And sadly, many of the young people are not making ANY attempt at ""social distancing.""  I hiked all day on Monday March 23 in Annadel State Park, and every ADULT hiker or biker I met was politely staying 6 feet away.  Not the teenagers and 20-somethings.  They were in groups and goofing off.  So the Sonoma County health department decided, ""CLOSE ALL THE PARKS AND BEACHES!!!""  I would say ""That is so dumb--give every one of those teen scofflaws a misdemeanor citation and let them spend some time in 'juvie'....""  But the problem is, none of the police or rangers want to get close enough to anyone to give them a citation.  So they are stuck with closing the parks.  We know of other trails, though, that are NOT in parks, so we are OK.  We didn't successfully thru-hike from Mexico to Canada THREE TIMES by being easily spooked.  We are determined to go for it on April 24.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Wed",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627377,"Here in Sonoma County where I live, they have closed ALL the parks, from little pocket parks in residential areas to the large regional parks and even national parks. All beaches are closed, too. That's made it a challenge to find ways to do training hikes! But where there is a will, there is a way, and we have been able to find some good STEEP hills in residential areas of Petaluma where we can still do plenty of huffing and puffing as we carry our 20-25 lb. packs.
I thought of an interesting parallel. Last year, much of the PCT was deep in an insane amount of snow. Very, very few hikers were able to complete a thru hike due to those difficult conditions. Well this year, it's not an insane amount of snow we have to deal with--it's an insane SITUATION. If we are able to pull off a thru hike of the AT this year, I will feel like we are sort of in a similar group to those who pulled off a thru hike of the PCT last year. A friend of ours recently posted on Facebook: ""ATTITUDE is the difference between an ordeal and an adventure."" Yeah!The AT Conservancy has asked the hikers to PLEASE! GET OFF THE TRAIL AND GO HOME! So have the CDTA and now even the PCTA. We actually agree with them! The way that 99% of the hikers operate, they SHOULD get off the trail and go home! But we do not do things in the way of the 99%. We operate very differently.Here are 3 differences: 1) We NEVER camp around other people. We AVOID them. Why? Because 99% of other hikers are seriously stupid. They COOK when they camp! That is like inviting every bear in the territory to come visit. They often build campfires--another way to invite every bear to pay a call. They sit up late talking. When we camp, we find a stealth site, set up our tent or tarp and go to bed, and that's it. We don't even EAT where we camp. 2) We MINIMIZE town stops. On both the PCT and the CDT, we easily kept up with and often even passed much younger, faster hikers. Why? Because they went off trail to every town they could get to and stayed there as long as they could, hanging out. We did much longer stretches on trail between town stops, and minimized our time in town. 3) We never joined a ""tramily."" We hiked with just the two of us because we didn't want the complications of trying to coordinate with a tramily. And on the PCT and CDT, there were often stretches where we saw no other hikers for days. That was fine with us.
So we are continuing to pack our boxes--a job somewhat complicated by the bare shelves in the stores; we've had to go online to order stuff instead of being able to just grab it locally. I continue to work on sewing our new raingear (I make a lot of what we wear). We answer phone calls from the kids in our Awana Club who want to recite their Bible verses to us over the phone, since they can't do it in person at club. We train and train and train. And pray and pray and pray that God will open doors for us to be able to get to the AT and be able to do this thru hike. On both our PCT hikes and again on the CDT, we repeatedly experienced many almost miraculous occasions where we know God was working things out for us and saying, ""I love you."" That's how He is. He is truly awesome.",,View Entry,"Mar 28, Sat",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627611,"A glorious day today of hiking through the cow pastures. Wow, the calves are getting big--and the bulls are out with the cows now, so we had to be a little bit careful!! We weren't running with the bulls, but we were HIKING with them.  One in particular really glowered at us.  Then it was on through the forest till we reached the ""view of the blue""--the Pacific Ocean far below us. We could just barely see the breakers along the shore, because it was a very hazy day. But it was the first day this year that we could hike without jackets on! The sun felt so good.
We continue to carry our heavy training packs, and we look for hills to climb, on the theory that the AT has lots of hills and we'd better be ready.
We are still poised to head for our AT thru-hike if all the restrictions are removed.  
Meanwhile, our last bit of resupply stuff we are still waiting for is our Emer-Gen-C packets, which we always take along for the good taste and the vitamins. It has been very hard to find any, though, even online. Everywhere you look, it's ""out of stock."" But we finally located a supply and hopefully it will be on its way to us tomorrow.
This whole coronavirus thing is totally stupid and crazy. The bottom line is, ""Yes, it's a very contagious and quick-spreading virus. But No, it is no more deadly than any nasty strain of flu."" To shut down the whole country and scare people to death is just plain awful. What is interesting is that Fixit and I are pretty sure we DID get coronavirus--way back in January or so. The experts are now saying that it arrived in California (that's us!) way far before the rest of the country. Back in January, Fixit and I both got hit very suddenly with what we ended up referring to as ""the cough thing."" I got it first. We were hiking out at Point Reyes--I felt fine in the morning, but around 3:00 pm, I suddenly started having a cough every time I went uphill, and even when I tried to talk to Fixit. Cough, cough, cough. I jokingly said, ""Oh bother, it must be the Colorado Cough from the CDT doing a rerun."" (The Colorado Cough is well-known among CDT thru-hikers--you spend so much time at 11,000-12,000 feet (and higher) that the extremely dry air causes many hikers to develop a cough).
But the next day I felt awful--nauseous and very weak. I just lay on the couch all day. And coughed, and coughed. The next day I was better, and after that rapidly got back my strength and energy. But the cough didn't finally disappear for a whole month. Many of my friends reported having similar symptoms.
We are very much hoping that all the sheltering and other restrictions will lift before May 15. That's the latest we would be able to start an AT thru hike. We are determined to be ready.

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627882,"Fixit and I are scrubbing our mission to hike the AT this summer.  Grrrrrr.  What finished it off was reading the latest updates from the ATC, especially the one about all the AMC huts in the White Mountains being closed for the rest of the year.  We had not planned to stay in a hut, but we did plan to EAT at them as often as possible, to save having to carry as much food.  The other clincher was that the AT/Long Trail on state land in Vermont is closed.  We had set May 15 as the end of our ""window"" for doing a thru hike, and that's still a week away, but with so many closures still in place, and even some new ones, we do not want to travel all the way from California for nothing.We have friends and family who are professional medical people of various sorts, and they tell us that pretty much any real medical professional does not consider covid19 to be any more of a ""threat"" than the flu. they are not personally worried about getting it. The media has totally hyped it up and made so many people scared, and then the heavy, ponderous hand of government enters the picture.  Grrrr.  We are cheering for the countries that never went into lockdown (like Sweden) and the states which have ""opened up"" and are no longer self-destructing.So it will be end of April 2021 when we will start the trail.  Our only concern is that ANOTHER panic attack will happen because of ANOTHER nasty flu and they will freak out and shut everything down again.  We fervently hope that what everyone learns from this whole experience is that what was done was misguided, stupid and destructive.  All this talk of ""oh, we have to help protect people""--there is nothing to be protected FROM, unless you have made lifestyle choices which make you vulnerable to the flu.  In that case, YOU STAY HOME and let the rest of us run free!See y'all in 2021!",,View Entry,"May 09, Sat",0
