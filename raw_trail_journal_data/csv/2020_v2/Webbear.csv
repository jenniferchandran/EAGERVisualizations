Webbear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/235586,"So many things to think about when one comtemplates the vision of a thru-hike. Equipment, food, hygiene, clothing, weather, and the list just goes on and on. These past years I have reseached these and other aspects of long distance hiking. In the up coming entries I shall touch upon a few of these items.",,Thoughts,"Jun 06, Fri",0
Webbear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/235599,"Many people are amazed when I tell them I am going to hike the Appalachian Trail. The respones range from ""GOOD FOR YOU"" to ""ARE YOU CRAZY?"" But most people ask ""Why are you doing it?"" My reason, I guess, is for the challenge and adventure. With twenty-five years of seating behind a computer screen life has got pretty mundane and boring. I want to see if I have the internal fortitude to complete this task. Can I hike the miles needed day in and day out? Can I live out of a pack that I carry on my back? Can I overcome the fears, lonelyness, pain, and weather from GA to ME? WE SHALL SEE!",,My Why,"Jun 06, Fri",0

Webbear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/290137,"On September 12 I did a 5 to 6 mile hike at a local Boy Scout camp. With a pack weight of about 25 pounds which felt good most of the day. The hike took us over a mile of wet-lands walk-ways and around two small lakes. I took it slow but still finished in 3 hours. Over all a good hike and the scouts I took along thought so too.    I have been reading many Journals of thur-hikers and their completion of their journeys. This has caused me so many differnet emotions. I am so very happy for them and thier accomplishment. At the same time I wish I was there also. In the woods fighting the bugs, walking in the rain, seeing all the wounderous vistas, sleeping under the star.... goodness.... I hope my departure date gets here quickly. I Now say ""Congratulation Class of 2009 on your determination and will power to get the task done ..... GA > ME 2009 ..... HURRAY""!!!!",,Shake down hike one,"Sep 16, Wed",0

Webbear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/333776,"I found this on a SOBO hikers journal and thought I would share it here:When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, When the road you're trudging seems all uphill, When the funds are low and the debts are high, And you want to smile, but you have to sigh, When care is pressing you down a bit, Rest, if you must, but don't you quit. Life is queer with its twists and turns, As every one of us sometimes learns, And many a failure turns about, When he might have won had he stuck it out; Don't give up though the pace seems slow, You may succeed with another blow. Often the goal is nearer than, It seems to a faint and faltering man, Often the struggler has given up, When he might have captured the victor's cup, And he learned too late when the night slipped down, How close he was to the golden crown. Success is failure turned inside-out, The silver tint of the clouds of doubt, And you never can tell how close you are, It may be near when it seems so far, So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit, It's when things seem worst that you must not quit. ~ Author unknown",,Ponder This Quote,"Nov 30, Tue",0

Webbear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/366321,"With constant daily pressures and recent events in my employment, I have been forced to face the facts that my walk in the woods must be delayed. I will push my start date forward now to 12 March 2016. Hopefully with this new date, the economy will be in a better state and my family can have fewer worries about me on the trail hiking. It deeply saddens me continuing to live vicariously off those who hike before me though their journals, but one must do what one must do. My prayers are with each of you adventurers that take to the trails this year and every year that I am not in the mist of you. So, till my time comes, please start slow, stay focused, and always hike your own hike.",,Life changes --- and delays the trail,"Jan 23, Mon",0
