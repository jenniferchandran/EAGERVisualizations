Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625671,"My training for July - September 2020 AT final drive has been going well.  As mentioned previously, I've got osteoarthritis is both knees; the left knee is worst with virtually no cartilage remaining.  Right knee has very thin amount left. The discomfort has been tolerable due exclusively to the plan I've implemented since last July.  The plan essentially includes a focus on endurance, via daily treadmill workouts, backpacking in local state parks and biking.I'm confident that continuing this plan will enable me to summit Katahdin no later than the end of September. I've also been focusing on reading journals of other thru hikers in the NH and Maine trail sections.  I've been obtaining significant insight regarding their experiences with the terrain, pace,access to shelters, AMC huts and resupply.  Much of this confirms what I already know but additional info sources are always helpful.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Thu",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625747,"I continue with my daily routine of Endurance, Osteoarthritic knee strengthening, Muscle buildup. This all planned in response to my shortened section trek of last June, 2019 completing only 108 out of planned 500 miles to Katahdin from Rutland, VT, due to endurance meltdown and almost total lack of knee cartilage in both knees, especially the left knee.  As mentioned in prior posts, this plan which I set up for myself has been approved by my family doc as well as orthopedic MD and surgeon.  I was concerned that lack of cartilage should be cause to prevent my final push up Katahdin.  My ortho doc says it depends upon the severity of bone on bone pain and that not to worry about bones collapsing or chipping away; knee replacement surgery is not recommended due to potential complications including nerve damage, infection, damage to adjacent tissue and at the extreme...heart failure. Knee replacement is recommended only when pain becomes intolerable.  He said ""you'll know when its time..."" but be in no hurry.The daily routine Endurance plan is focused primarily upon cardio strengthening for which I use a Sole treadmill which I programmed a routine than combines speed and incline designed to strengthen my heart muscles with the objective of providing more oxygen thus easing stress on the heart, thus significantly improving endurance.  Problems with maintaining endurance and suffering from exhaustion go hand in hand, evidenced by my readings of various 2019 journals of thru and section hikers daily accounts going through the Whites and Maine.  These accounts have provided me with invaluable knowledge to use in being prepared for what's to come at every turn in my, what I hope, through my dedicated efforts, to be my final section hike on the AT -- to the top of Maine....projected to be around 9/22/20.An additional facet of my game plan is frequent hikes during the week at nearby state park mountains for which I take a pack and poles, increasing the pack weight gradually between 15 to 30 lbs. Each hike is between 7 1/2 and 15 mi.If your long term hiking the trail this year, be prepared and competent in your ability to endure the physical and mental stress what will come. This includes pack weight, proper equipment, foods rich in protein & carbs, knowledge of water and resupply sources and campsites/hostels to stay. I prepared a daily itinerary which I know can change at any time due to weather, injury, etc. This is a good planning tool and promotes confidence that you've thought it through.",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Mon",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625924,"Updating my workout progress toward upcoming July final section push to Katahdin....20lb dumbbells (10 each) increased to 75 reps per day(am, afternoon, pm).  Incline and speed increased on programmed treadmill exercise on a daily basis. Cardio is my main focus. Leg and knee strength follows a close second.  In the months ahead, this will equalize.",,View Entry,"Jan 24, Fri",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626099,I continue to strictly adhere to my endurance training program to ensure good cardio and core and overall body muscular strength. I'm also continuing to seek ways to minimize the weight in my pack. I learned from prior section hikes on the trail months on end that * I'll typically come home with things that I never use. It is these items that I will leave out of my pack for the next trip.,,View Entry,"Feb 07, Fri",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626245,Today I hiked 12 miles at my nearby State Park. The hike was over moderate terrain with an average incline of between 8 and 15%. The weather was a bit cool at 31 degrees F. This hike gave me an opportunity to try on different layers to see what would work when I hike  over the White mountains and into Maine this summer. I've read trail journals from various hikers in the Whites last year of temps that can dip down into the low 30s and start out in the mid-30s in early morning when you start your hike. I plan at least 2 to 3 hikes per week in the 7 to 12 mile range. Pack weight today was 16 lbs. As the weeks and months go on prior to July I will adjust the number of hikes and pack weight upward.,,View Entry,"Feb 16, Sun",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626420,Yesterday and today I hiked 8 miles each day picking a slightly different route for each day. This provided me a very robust workout and I could see my  day-to-day endurance getting much stronger. Tomorrow will be raining.  I'd like to test my rain gear but I think I'll pass for tomorrow and go to the treadmill for 80 minutes and also do my normal 75 reps of 13 pound dumbbells each hand and also 40 reps of 5 lb dumbbells lifted horizontally. I will also continue with the leg raises and knee bends. I continue to carry a 16 lb pack and expect to increase the weight in about a week. My left knee which is without cartilage and my right knee with cartilage about as thin as a sheet of paper is a consideration which I must factor into each day's work out.,,View Entry,"Feb 24, Mon",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627365,"Its been a few weeks since I've reported on pre hike activities.  
Took several 8 to 10 mi hikes in nearby state game lands with moderate inclines. I also continue my daily regimen of cardio and leg strengthening treadmill runs along with ramping my 14 lb dumbbells reps to 75 per day.  This regimen has brought very noticeable results compared with my endurance a year ago when the regimen was not nearly enough.  
Sadly as we all know, Covid 19 has created such a dire situation for thousands of people all over the world with the highest incidence now in the US. Quite frankly and obviously, the suffering on so may levels, i.e. the climbing death rate, economic losses, et al, far outweigh the stoppage to our burning desire to thru or section hike the AT that we have prepared for physically, mentally and logistically for so long.  
I was planning for a late July departure from New Hampshire to complete my final section north bound to Katahdin.  I'm 70 with not many years left to make it.  Viewing the trends and projecting therefrom, its unlikely 2020 is the year.   However, life is what it is and we can only try to succeed within the scheme of nature's grand plan.   Unless that curve suddenly deflates and absolutely no risk is present, we may be lucky to reach our goals sometime in 2022. But in any event, I applaud the efforts of our front line ""infantry"" consisting of doctors, nurses, first responders, researchers and supporting staff who lay their lives on the line for us in this horrible time in our lives.  In light of this, please join me in giving abundant thanks to the heroes noted above, follow their advice and use common sense in doing your part to crush this pandemic.",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Fri",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628457,"Hoping that by near end of July, 2020 the AT will reopen, at least from Glencliff, NH north to Katahdin....this is the section I need to complete my AT journey.I continue to work out daily and hike local trails.  If the situation gets better, I will then re-look logistics and food drops, etc.",,View Entry,"Jun 09, Tue",0

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630389,"I slack packed for the first time since I started the trail in Springer several years ago in sections.  Since this was the first real ascent for this trip and being a difficult one, slacking made all the sense.  Being 70, and fresh from training for the past year, the slack was great. Felt like I really enjoyed the hike of this difficulty in a long time.  I carry a 45 lb backpack and have a knee needing replacement so the slack was a Godsend.  Met shuttler Marlene (I recommend) at the Kinsman Notch trailhead for a ride to the Notch Hostel which proved to be a great place.  Coming down off the north side of Mousilaukee tested your resolve due to very slippery conditions, a couple slips and falls required me to adjust my descent skills.","Jeffers Brook Shelter

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630390,"What I thought was going to be a less strenuous hike turned out to be the Whites through and through.  Summited Mt. Wolf along with other peaks on this stretch.  Slippery conditions descending and slow going on ascents realized a slow pace for me today such that I arrived about 8 pm at the shelter which for me was way late.  Hikng with a full 45 lb pack on only my second day in the Whites was tough for me and showed in my pace.  My osteoarthritic left knee, now bone on bone, was quite painful.  I did not think, with the training program I faithfully follwed during the last year, that the knee would be such a problem.  But it was more the very tedious, slippery, dangerous conditions that did not bode well for me.  About the only good thing that went well for me today was the weather.","Notch Hostel

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630392,"Knowing what was ahead today, I got an early start, about 7 am but did not complete my hike today until dark...about 8 pm.  The difficulty of North & South Kinsman peaks is all you need to know.  I had several more slips and falls on treacherous rocks on the way down.  My pace was very slow as a result and I knew I needed a new strategy for the days ahead.  I truly enjoyed the ascents but the descents were what did me in today.  I had difficulty finding the trailhead under Routes 3 and 93, not well signed even though I was using Guthooks which indicated that the TH was ""nearby"".  I was lucky to ford the 2 streams in the dark and staying on trail before reaching the interstate.  I found solace and rest at an Inn in Lincoln.  The following day I decided to take a zero. Problems developed mainly due to medications I take for senior issues such as blood pressure, etc.  As a result I was very dizzy and passing out occasionally.  thinking it through I decided with a heavy heart to abandon the hike for this year.  I severely underestimated the Whites even after all I read about them.  I thought what I already experiencede this far on the trail prepared me for the remainder of the journey.So here's the plan....in several months I will undergo a full knee replacement, go through intensive therapy and get my pack weight down to 30 pounds or less.  After I'm on both feet, my workout routine will continue with weights, treadmill and local state park 10 mile hikes with backpack. I will need to have a good heart to heart with both myself and my physician about age, muscle loss and other factors (you 25 year olds don't need to be concerned with) but in the end its obviously up to me to decide if I have what it takes to complete the Trail.","Eliza Brooke Shelter

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632137,"HI folks:My last post mentioned that I was looking for strategic changes to enable me to finish the trail summer 2021.In November, 2020 I had a full left knee replacement, not just for hiking but because it has been painful day to day and knee was void of cartilege...bone to bone.  It has been 6 weeks since the surgury and working with my surgeon and physical therapists I have had great success in meeting all rehab goals with an excellent degree of flexion in the knee.  It will need another 3 to 4 months to try moderate hiking terrain.  After assessment, my goal will be to continue with the rehab and shoot to hike the more strenuous ascents in my area in PA prior to starting from Lincoln, NH in July, 2021.  I plan to finish no later than 9/15/21.  I could not have picked a more difficult section in the AT to start my final section, since the hiker legs will not have fully developed by then. However, I am hopeful my training regimen, which is very robust, will enable my body to be in shape to tackle this toughest of all sections.  I can hardly wait!  I've made some changes in core gear items including tent and backpack.  I've chosen a Granite Gear 60L and I am still undecided on an UL tent but will settle for  nothing more than 2 1/2 lbs.  These 2 items alone will reduce my pack weight 4 lbs.  Last year I was hoisting 45 lbs whick at my age (71) was a killer in the long run.  My plan is getting pack weight down to 30 lbs.  This alone will make a huge difference.",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Thu",0
