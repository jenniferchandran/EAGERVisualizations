Stayed last night before starting trail at Amicalola Falls SP campground. It had rained the night before and just stopped in the morning. Woke up around 8 am, made coffee and started organizing pack. Started looking like a nice day. Took everything out of car and double-checked to make sure I got everything I wanted to take on trail that was mixed in with all our other camping gear. Put a bunch of stuff in a soft cooler that Alyssa will bring to Charleston in early May and also included my fishing gear and laptop.
Finally got everything packed around noon. Had a difficult time closing my pack as it was completely full. Then I realized I hadn't packed my coffee press and 10 oz of coffee. Jerry convinced me I really didn't need coffee as I won't have time to really relax and enjoy it on trail. He was right and it saved me about a pound of weight. We first drove to top of falls, parked and I got out walked down just 100 steps or so to get a few pictures then headed to Visitor Center. Weighed my pack outside with their scale and it weighed in at 34 pounds, no water, right at the max I wanted to carry. Got my tag with registration number 974. Took some pictures at the arch even though I wasn't doing the approach trail. Then we drove to the Springer Mountain parking lot from the west.
In the parking lot we split the last Yeungling and split a mini bottle shot of Tennessee whiskey. Jerry forgot to hit the record button so the video he thought he was making didn't get preserved for posterity. He started another recording as we said our goodbyes and I headed up trail to Springer Mountain summit (arrived 3:09pm), the southern terminus of the AT. It was already 2:30 pm so I knew I wasn't going to make it to Hawk Mountain Shelter as planned and instead set sights on stopping short at Stover Creek Shelter.
It was a partly cloudy day so I wore my sunglasses for the first day of hiking trail (writing this several days later in Neel Gap and haven't worn the them since). Signed the register in the rock, took a few requisite pictures and started on trail.
It was a fairly easy 2.8 miles to Stover shelter arriving at 5 pm, set up camp and hung around the shelter while eating my first Mountain House. There was a nice group of about 15 there - not really overcrowded. Played ""Scotland the Brave"", ""Amazing Grace"" and ""Piano Man"" on my harmonica and got a few complements. It got dark a little after 8 and everyone was in their tents by 8:30. AT shelters are not the place for late night parties.
Fell asleep shortly after I got in my tent but then woke up to a pretty good rain storm. Lots of rain pouring down, lightning and thunder that was only a couple seconds behind meaning bolts were hitting pretty close.
Middle of night I realized I had a nice puddle in the tent. Hard to explain, but with my single-walled zPacks Duplex, if you push against the bottom bathtub wall it will extend outside the rain fly/roof and water will flow right into the tent. That's what happened. Mopped up the puddle with my camp towel and vowed to be extra vigilant about pushing against side of tent. With the early nap, then the storm and excitement of first night on trail, probable only got a few hours of good sleep.

First night no rain overnight. Got up around 7:30, ate two strawberry oatmeals, and got on trail at 9 am. Cameled up at small stream on way out of camp and carried usual full bottle of water. Replenished at Slaughter Creek along the way.
Even though mostly uphill to Blood Mountain, there were quite of few flat sections and slight downgrades. It was on one of them that I got inspired to get into a slow jogging rythm. My pack was now a few pounds lighter than at start and I think my legs are getting in better shape. It's like the difference I can feel when I hit the treadmill four or five days in a row. You feel like you are ready to just bolt if you have to. I think I jogged a good quarter mile out the 7.4 I did today.
The climb to the top wasn't all that bad. What made it difficult was that it was cooler today, maybe mid to upper fourties and raining. My hands got cold so I got out my rain mitts and they helped alot. Would have been really nice to put one of the three pair of gloves I had in my pack, but they were burried deep in there and I wasn't about to unload my pack on trail while it was starting to rain. Lesson learned - always keep one pair of gloves in an outside pocket so I can easily get to them if it gets cold.
Since it was windy and cold up on top of Blood Mountain didn't hang around for more than a few minutes in shelter. Just took a picture of shelter and headed down mountain. The initial descent was pretty tricky going down a smooth boulder field. Would not want to do that with snow or ice on trail!
Arrived at Neels Gap at 1:20 pm. Checked out Mountain Crossings outfitter to re-weigh my pack. Wasn't the best scale to get an accurate weight, but it read 30 lbs. That's 4 lbs lighter than at start which is about right for three days of food. Actually, they say you should eat 2 lbs/day, but I don't feel like I starved myself at all.
Overheard someone saying there were still spaces in hostel, so for $20 sounded like a no-brainer. Got my first shower since Jetty Park Campground in Cape Canaveral 8 days ago. Got a few slices of someone's leftover pizza, went to Mountain Crossings to resupply, bought a Philly cheese steak and Coke for dinner. Played a little harmonica. Did a little birding. Heard and saw the usual suspects like chickadees, nuthatches, Robin's, Cardinals, Carolina Wrens, Downy Woodpeckers, and Dark-eyed juncos.
First leg of journey is in the books. Next resupply should be at Dick's Creek Gap four days from now where I'll spend a night in Hiawassee.

Did laundry at Holiday Inn Express. First ran all my down stuff (sleeping bag, puffy jacket and booties) on low heat while I washed all other clothes. Woke back up around 2 am to put washed clothes in dryer. Spread all my other gear out all over the suite to let everything else dry out.
 Started going through all my gear to decide what to ship back home to lighten my load. With no end in sight to the rain and fog I decided to ditch my binoculars and camera for now. After one week I think I only got one or two good bird pictures, and one was a chickadee that are in abundance here and back home in the Laurel Highlands of PA. All this stuff I'm unloading will be shipped to my daughter who I'll see in early May. At that time I'll be able to unload a couple of cold weather items and should continue on with camera and binoculars to do some birding when there's more daylight and nicer weather.
Didn't get a whole lot of sleep, maybe only four hours total. Went down and got a good hot breakfast (omelette, sausage, biscuits and gravy) which was included in the $109 price for the room.
Went back up to room and finished going through gear. Loaded it all into a bag that I could tell weighed a few pounds. That was exactly what I needed. The plan was to skip a town visit to Franklin, NC, and go all the way to the NOC, 67.5 miles away. I figured I could do that in 6 days. Now I will have room in my pack for more food and it won't weigh any more than when I start.
As I was checking out ran into Bernie and Johnny Walker hanging out on the lobby. Didn't know they had a room there as well that night. We got set up with Guthook to follow each other. Will be great to run into them again later on trail. They are taking a zero so it might be a while before I run into them again, maybe after I take my week off in May.
Stopped by outfitter to pick up a spare fuel cannister and a few Mountain Houses, then to Ingles to round out the resupply. The stuff to be shipped home weighed in at 5 pounds on Ingles scale! That is huge!!! My food bag also weighed 5 pounds, so now I had 6 days of food and my pack weighs what it did without any food, about 30 pounds.
Stopped by PO next to Ingles and shipped box priority where they confirmed the 5 lbs weight.
Then it was time to hitch a ride back to Dick's Creek Gap. Started walking towards Budget Inn to see if they a shuttle heading up the mountain, but right near the Domino's where I got a cheese steak the night before, one of the guys that works there offered me a ride. Southern hospitality is awesome!
Got back on trail about 3 pm. It was clear overnight and through the morning, but by now we were back to overcast, fog and light rain.
No cell service at Dick's Creek Gap, so when I got to the top of a hill at mile 70.4, I stopped for a few minutes to send a couple of texts and synchronize my checkin on Guthooks. Started hiking again and after 20 minutes or so I ran into two hikers that were thru-hiking and asked them why they were going the wrong way. We'll, it was me going wrong way so I hiked 0.8 miles of trail three times (2 nobo, 1 sobo) and lost 52 minutes. Good thing I had my compass with me!!! Note to self: learn to use the damn thing!

Morning temp 42. Had the campsite all to myself (#2). Another beautiful day. Got on trail at 9:20, passed US64/Winding Stair Gap at 3pm, then arrived Silar Bald Shelter at 6pm. That's only 1.4 mph, alot slower than a couple of days I did at 1.75, but there were a couple of good climbs that really slowed me down.
Started off hiking in my usual long sleeve base layer running jersey, but quickly changed out to my short sleeved t- shirt. It was a beautiful day for a hike in the woods, right around 60 I'd say. Being a Saturday, passed quite a few day hikers, a few of which paused to chat a minute. On departing, offered them a rendition of ""Scotland the Brave"" on my harmonica which was met with various levels of jubilation.
Took the blue trail towards Silar Bald Shelter and was gonna go all the way there, but got to a stealth site where a couple (Ben and Amy) that passed me along the way were setting up camp. They told me it was another half mile to shelter, but water was just a short walk away. Since there was room for my tent on a slight slope it was a no-brainer to just drop my pack, go get water and camp here as well. Hey, thruhikers will do the whole 2000+ miles of the AT, but go an extra half mile down a hill for a place to sleep - forget it.
Only 23.7 miles to the NOC from here. That's one full day of hiking today and should get to the general store there to resupply and recharge batteries before they close tomorrow. I'm down to one bar on my power pack, but I've got a near-full charge on my phone. If I stay in airplane mode and conserve, should make it to NOC tomorrow without my phone dying.

As has been happening pretty much every day since I started trail, I crawled into my sleeping bag soon after dark about 9pm and fell asleep. Like clockwork, I woke up again in the middle of the night about 2:30 am. It felt pretty cold, checked thermometer and it read 41. Stayed awake for an hour then fell back asleep.
What was different about this morning was that I woke up to a quite vivid dream, first one I can remember on trail. I got off trail to go to some kind of hotel/casino where I bought  trifecta ticket that hit for $200,000! Checked and double-checked the numbers a number of time. Sorry, but I don't remember the numbers for all you gamblers out there that love numbers. I had a really hard time getting to the cashier and for a while couldn't find it, but finally did and made it to a real makeshift type of cashier. They didn't seem to have a way of handling big winners, but then a supervisor lady came and took my ticket without getting my contact info. I remember talking to people about how I really wouldn't get the full two hundred grand, but maybe half after tax withholding. I started thinking about how I might be able to buy a boat already equipped for ocean sailing rather than spending the time fixing up my boat to sail around the world. Oh, then totally unrelated, I dreamt I sat on or rolled over into my glasses and broke them. Well, then I woke up and found out that it was all a dream. Damn, no winning ticket in my sleeping bag and glasses intact. I think I would gladly take a broken pair of glasses for that big chunk of change!
Met Mitch and 007 again on trail at both Silar Bald and Wayah Bald. First saw them at Stover Creek. They remembered a guy playing harmonica there. I guess that was me.
Ben and Amy pitched their tent in the same general area when I was at Silar Bald  Shelter trail stealth site. I saw them again in the morning after the cool lightning storm at Cold Spring Shelter.

Lots of heavy rain, lightning and thunder overnight. Still raining when I woke up, but just stopped as I got all packed up and broke camp. Still looked like rain and was still pretty cool, so put on poncho, rain pants and rain mitts for rain protection and extra warmth. It warmed up a bit so took off rain mitts after a couple hours on trail. Rained a little off and on throughout the day's hike, but not too heavy. Early part of trail was literally a stream so had to be careful not to step in a really deep puddle. My waterproof hiking shoes are nice knowing I can slosh in a puddle and stay dry as long as it's not deeper than the sides of my shoes.
Big climb today was 800 ft ascent up to Wesser Bald. There was nothing to see so no reason to climb fire tower. The rest of trail today was a few more short ups, but mostly downhill. Some parts of descent were pretty steep slowing me down quite a bit. Overall, did the 11.5 miles in 6:08. That's 1.88 mph, maybe my fastest pace yet.
Passed Tree and Danja along the way. Met them the night before as I pulled into Cold Spring Shelter. Unfortunately, they are getting off trail because of the uncertainties of trail support during these trying times.
Arrived at NOC at 3:42pm. A number of hikers milling about, a few just about to catch a shuttle to gas station store a mile away. Went in and started charging power pack and phone. Grabbed an Italian sub, heated it up on microwave and washed it down with my first beer in 12 days - a 16 oz Arragant Bastard, 7.2% abv. That was so good.
Read a Guthooks comment that there was a stealth campsite along the river, so followed directions to find it (go to train tracks, follow green fence to right, go down steps, find camp). Washed hair using spigot at front of outfitter across the street from store  Went back to general store, bought lots of junk food (candy bars, pastry, donuts, etc) for 3-day resupply to Fontana Dam. Store was  closing at 6pm, so got 3 bars on my power pack and full charge on phone, so should be good for 3 days. Bought a roast beef sub and another beer for dinner. Put on my pack and went to ""Hobo Island"" to set up camp. Found a spot at end of area and met Kelly from Maine who was also camping there for the night. Unfortunately, she had to get off trail for a few days to nurse a foot injury. We talked for a bit as I ate my sandwich listening to the constant roar of the Nantahala River that was flowing quite well.
Set up camp. Mom called so we talked a little while. Checked alot of online stuff for the first time in days. Deployed Ursack once more and called it a night.Fortitudine VincimusHarpo","Cold Spring Shelter

No rain overnight. Packed up, said goodbye to Kelly complementing her on her great bear bag hang, and went back to general store. A number of thruhikers milling about including Ben and Amy that I first met at Silar Bald Shelter and again the morning after the stormy night at Cold Spring Shelter. Sound like they might try to push on. Others not so sure.
Went in and got a good cup of coffee and bought a Chicken Ceasar wrap and a pint of Left Hand Brewing Milk Stout for dinner.
Started climb up Cheoah Bald at 11am. Started to rain shortly after I hit trail, but I expected it and already had on my poncho and rain pants.  Arrived Sassafras Gap Shelter at 3:20 so decided to push on. Rain stopped briefly and I thought that was it for the rain, but I was wrong. Was really on the cool side, probably low forties, so wore my rain mitts to keep hands warm. The rain was very steady and pretty heavy at times so my rain gear held out no longer and I was getting soaked all the way through. Hiking shirt and pants felt totally soaked, socks were squishy. Started feeling chills the minute I slowed down or took a break so kept up the fastest pace I could. This was perfect weather for getting hypothermia. Hands were still cold with just rain mitts so put Smartwool gloves on as base layer. Eventually, they got soaked as well.
By the time I got to top of Cheoah Bald at 4:01 and took my gloves off to check in and take a couple of pictures, my hands were very cold. Started trek down mountain and started warming back up. I knew I could make the 5.6 miles to Stecoah Gap within three hours since I have been doing about 2 mph on flats and descents recently. As it warmed a bit on the descent, was able to take off gloves and mitts without hands feeling cold.
The trail followed a ridgeline near the final part of the descent doing some small ups and downs not knowing when I'd finally be dropping down into the gap. I was out of water shortly after sumitting Cheoah so I knew I had to get off the ridge before I'd find a mountain stream. Finally, looking ahead all I could see was the mountain on the other side of the gap. The trail had to start descending down into the gap and I'd find water soon. Sure enough after a while I found a very small stream going across trail that I was able to get maybe a half bottle of water at a time to filter. Guzzled at least a half liter, filled up my bottle and was now ready to find a campsite for the night.
Arrived Stecoa Gap about 6:50. Nice parking area with trash cans and picnic table. Still soaked head to toe. Possible stealth site a mile ahead. Sheriff SUV parked looking for speeders. Small grassy area just beyond picnic area. Decided to pitch tent right here. Sheriff never bothered me. I really needed to get those wet clothes off and into my dry camp clothes. All is well now. Gonna eat that Chicken Caesar wrap and down that beer!

Was still drizzling on and off as I was setting up my tent the night before, but finally got it set up. It was difficult because I didn't want to tent in the fenced picnic area, but just outside of it next to the gated forest service road. The ground was really hard near the road, so had to keep shifting the tent so I could drive a stake into the ground.
Checked radar and could see that a nasty storm would soon be passing through for the next few hours, but should be gone around 1 or 2 am. During the storm the wind blew one of the stakes holding one of trekking poles up, do I had to hold onto it to keep it upright so that the tent wouldn't collapse. On top of the storm, cars would pull into the parking area and hang out for a little while. Finally, the rain did stop around 2 am, so I got out and fixed that stake. It was still a bit windy, so that stake came out once more later in the night, but I was able to adjust the pole by angling it outwards and at least it stayed up. At most a few drizzles passed through so I wasn't worried about rain coming into the tent. In the morning, everything was a little damp from condensation, but only one small puddle on the downslope side of tent to mop up with camp towel. I don't think I got more than a few hours of sleep. Did not feel really well rested in the morning.
Morning temp was 47.6 degrees. Really didn't feel like putting on cold, soaking wet clothes, so I hung all the wet stuff out to dry on the fence post as the temperature warmed up.
Was talking to a guy walking his dog when Quest, who hiked trail in 2004, came over to talk. He asked what my trail name was so I told him ""Harpo"" because I play the harmonica. I played him my go-to song ""Scotland the Brave"" which he said he'd look up and try and play on his bluegrass instrument (mandolin maybe?). I'll have to lookup his trail journal when I get a chance. The guy walking his dog offered me ride to Robbinsville, but declined as I had all the supplies I needed to get to Fontana Dam.
Then another guy (Doyi) showed up who was a shuttle driver, but again I declined a ride. But, he did give me his phone number in case I need a shuttle before I get out of this area. We maintained a good six foot ""social distance"" as he is a 70 year old guy with some risk of complications from coronavirus.
With the nice breeze and the temp warming up into the fifties, my clothes dried out enough to move on. Latest start yet at 1:23 pm.
Trail was pretty uneventful. Unfortunately, no good clearings for view of Smokies. It was just so nice to hike with the sun shining through most of the time. I did feel like I was dragging ass wondering what happened to all the energy I had the day before. Strange pains that came and went and the shin splints were particularly annoying. Well, hopefully an easy eight mile day and a good night's sleep will solve that.
Arrived Cable Gap Shelter at 6:20. Only one here is a guy in a tent. Said ""Hi."" We didn't talk much. He's not a thru-hiker, just out in the woods for some days with his dog.

No rain overnight as expected. Got packed up and left camp at 10:46. Said ""bye, have a great day"" to my campmate, who replied, ""You too, Bud.""
Trail was pretty uneventful although it was an absolutely gorgeous day for hiking. Wish I had a day like today for Cheoah or Wesser Balds. Today's trail really didn't have any good vistas. Always too many trees blocking the view  Didn't run into anyone on trail again. The cool part was finally getting a close up look at Fontana Lake and hiking the lakeside trail leading to the shelter.
Arrived Fontana Dam Shelter at 2:37. Nobody home except alot of wasps and giant bees. Tried charging phone with charging station, but it didn't seem to work. Checked out concrete tent pads. Probably could pitch on one of them if I had to someday. Bathrooms were locked due to ""public safety.""
Sign on the board had the number for shuttle, so called it to get a ride to Fontana Village to do laundry and resupply. She said meet in parking lot, not at shelter. So, got all packed up and walked to parking area. Finally changed my convertible hiking pants into shorts.
Got a ride from lady shuttle driver who loved to say ""gotcha"" when I answered her question or explained something. She said park was closed and dam road is barricaded. Not sure though if it's just closed to vehicular traffic or also pedestrian traffic. It's like this all over the place. Areas are under lockdown. Not a single motel open in the county for travelers.
PitStop gas station/hiker resupply store was  closing at 4 so she dropped me off there. Laundromat is just 100 yards up the road. Got a few items to get me through the night (like a beer to drink with dinner) and got $5 in quarters for laundry.
Walked up to laundromat, changed into rain pants so I could wash my hiking pants and started wash cycle. Sat down on chair on patio and considered options. My goal is to carry 7-8 days worth of food, try to cross the dam, enter the park and hike the 75 miles through GSMNP without resupply.
Still had to be back here tomorrow to resupply so seemed to make sense to find a stealth site near the laundromat/PitStop rather than get a shuttle back to shelter and then another shuttle in the morning. It's 2.8 miles away, so not an easy walk from Fontana Village to Fontana Dam Shelter.
So I decided that when I put the clothes in the dryer I would have time to scope out the area to find a stealth site. Fontana Village is a resort, so alot of open space and roads all over the place. Not easy to find a spot where won't be seen from a road. Hiked up trail across road from laundromat that went behind the swimming pool bathhouse. Then the trail continued on up to part of the disc golf course, past a cemetery with a locked gate to keep the dead people in and then it wound back down to the road. There was a nice spot tucked away that would have been perfect, but it was right behind someone's back yard with a golf cart out front. That meant to me probably someone who worked for resort so scratch that spot.  Finally decided that right behind swimming pool bathhouse was best spot. There were even a few patio chairs there I could sit on to make/eat dinner.
So, went back to laundromat and got my now clean dry clothes all packed up. Also, realized there was a spigot out behind the laundromat, so washed my hair. Haven't had a shower since I was in Hiawassee, but at least I washed my hair at the NOC and again today. Feels good to have clean hair.
Walked across the road and up the little trail and I got to my stealth site behind bathhouse. Sat in a chair, boiled water for my Mountain House Beef Stroganoff dinner and washed it down with a good beer.
Waited until just before dark to setup tent to make sure nobody was gonna bother me and they didn't.
p.s.  When I was putting quarters in to start the washer, I must have put a couple of them in too fast because it didn't credit two of the quarters I put in (sign on board said put quarters in slowly). That meant I was $0.50 short for the dryer. A trail angel answered the call. I saw someone pull up and go into the post office, so I wandered over there so I could explain my dire situation and beg for two quarters. The lady was very nice and searched the front and back of her car until she found some change. She actually gave me four quarters. A true angel!!!

Did not sleep real well for whatever reason. The spotlight that shined into my tent didn't help. Got up around 7:30 am and packed up. Couldn't find two spare stakes. Looked and looked and but couldn't find them here. No problem, still have a few more spares.
Walked down road to PitStop and bought food for 8 days. High resort prices made for an expensive resupply: $162.82!
Store clerk called shuttle for me and I got a ride back as close to shelter as possible. Roads were barricaded so had to walk about a mile up road to shelter. County was going on complete lockdown. No travelers allowed in.
Made it to shelter and met a girl, Sierra, who had spent the night there. We talked a bit about how she had planned on doing a section hike starting at Fontana Dam and going through the Smokies, maybe further. Paid my credit card bills before they went overdue at the end of month, changed into my t-shirt as it was quite warm already, said ""See you on trail"" to Sierra, left shelter at 11:15 and headed for the dam. Nobody at the dam visitor center and nobody on the dam to stop a pedestrian from walking across. Kept walking on road that veered to right. Saw the first sign for Great Smoky Mountain NP and took a selfie.
Finally came to the point where the trail entered the woods. No ranger standing guard to keep me off trail. No signs posted to say park is closed. So I went back into the woods ready to traverse the entire 75 miles or so of AT in the park in one shot.
My hopes were to make it to Mollies Ridge Shelter - a 12 mile hike. But, the climb was quite strenuous and I didn't seem to have a real high energy level so when I got to Birch Spring Tentsite at 4:10 pm, I was ready to call it a day - one of the earliest stop times I've had since starting trail. It was a good decision.
About an hour later Sierra arrived and set up across the stream. We talked a little more, I played some harmonica and that was it for first day in Smokies.Fortitudine VincimusHarpo","Fontana Dam Shelter

We left Birch Spring Tentsite at 10:11. Trail profile was much more forgiving today than yesterday's 2200 ft climb out of Fontana. And, it was even warmer today. Well into the 60's so was able to hike in a t-shirt again. Never would've believed anyone if they told me I'd be hiking the Smokies in a t-shirt on the AT end of March!
No great views on today's hike, pretty uneventful. But then, just before reaching Spencer Field Shelter at mm 183.1 we came upon a family of three black bears, probably a mommy bear and her two good-sized cubs. I saw two of them first about 30 yards ahead hanging around a large felled tree on downhill side of trail. I stopped and whispered to Glitter, ""check out the bears ahead."" It was magical. Within seconds, the two bears took off down the mountain and then we also saw a third bear follow behind. So exciting! We saw a family of bears in the Smokey's!!!
We got to Spencer Field Shelter at 5pm and, of course, nobody was there.  No reason to pitch a tent especially since we are expecting a good storm to blow through sometime tomorrow morning. Glitter took top bunk, I got the lower.
Shelter has a nice heavy duty tarp to keep the wind and rain out of the sleeping area. But, there was also a fireplace inside the sleeping area. We gathered wood and  brought inside so we could make a nice fire. It hasn't rained for several days so the all twigs and branches were fairly dry and Glitter was intent on getting it started without using my last fire starter.
Having spent a couple months living in New Orleans inspired Glitter to bring a string of blue, green, purple, yellow ambiance lights that she strung just above the tarp and hung some Mardi Gras beads to complete the decorations. We had the coolest looking shelter!
All Glitter used was a paper towel and lighter to get the fire started. We had a pretty nice fire going for most of the evening.  Since it was just after 9 o'clock on a Saturday night, I played and sang ""Piano Man."" After that, we watched Billy Joel's version that I downloaded from YouTube. Glitter brought a real mini speaker system that we played the music from my phone. Great sound! Billy does it just a little bit better than me. A few more videos including an introduction to Jacques Brel (Les Vieux) and it was time for ""Silent Night"" on harmonica before going to sleep.Fortitudine VincimusHarpo","Birch Spring Tentsite

Rain was supposed to start at 8:30 am based on Weather Channel forecast that I got the night before. Instead, the storm started around 6:30 am, which was good in that it was only supposed to last a couple of hours and now we can get an earlier start on trail without starting out in rain. It was a pretty intense wind and rain that lasted a good hour. Fortunately, only a few thunderbolts. Sure glad I was in a shelter and not in my tent. No way all my stuff would stay dry in a storm like that. By 9 am, the skies were beginning to clear and started seeing some sunshine. Should be a little cooler today, but a nice day for hiking.
Stopped in Derrick Knob Shelter at 3:45 pm for a few minutes to camel up. Haven't run into any other hiker yet today. Old Chief stayed here two nights ago.
Arrived Silars Bald Shelter at 7:35 pm. Didn't see anyone on trail today. It was just me and Glitter.
Glitter realized that the rain and cold weather in the days ahead would be conditions beyond what she prepared for and besides that, her power pack was dead and iPhone on life support. So, she decided to stick to her original plan and bail at Newfound Gap. That meant we needed to get to Newfound Gap in time for her to get picked up and for me to continue on past the gap another 3 miles to Icewater Spring Shelter. That would make for a 15.3 mile day for me, so it was an early night to bed so we could get an early start in the morning.Fortitudine VincimusHarpo","Spencer Field Shelter

Got a good early start on trail at 9:20 am and made it to Clingmans Dome observation platform at 11:37 am. The place was deserted. There were some clouds, but visibility was pretty good while we were on the platform. The wind was blowing pretty good as expected.
I thought there was an outside chance the visitors center would have an outdoor receptacle where we could recharge, but I walked all around the building and didn't find one. At least one of the vault toilets in the parking area was open, so got to use that. And, of course, the visitors center was deserted as well.
Glitter called Park Dispatch (using my phone, hers was dead) to see what her options were for getting to Gatlinburg. Dispatch gave her the numbers of a few shuttle drivers, so she called them and all went to voicemail. So, she called her mom and dad and left messages. She called back a few minutes later and finally talked to her mom and told her we'd be at Newfound Gap around 5:30 pm. I gave her my phone to call her mom once more as we got close to Newfound Gap to reassure her mom we were on schedule.
We actually made good time  got to Newfound Gap at 4:50 pm and it was a relief to see her mom's car in the parking lot. She was out taking a little hike so I didn't get to meet her mom. It was time for me and Glitter to say goodbye, so a sweet hug and I was on my way to Icewater Spring Shelter. Got there at 6:51 pm. Of course, I had the shelter all to myself.
There was a nice bundle of branches in front of shelter, so I collected more and brought inside. All shelters in the Smokies have a heavy duty tarp that shields the interior sleeping area from the outside elements. Got a really good fire going. It was great. Stayed up late until fire burned out.Fortitudine VincimusHarpo","Silars Bald Shelter

Left Icewater Spring Shelter at 10:24 am. Pretty cold, in low 30's up here at 5919 ft. Gonna be a rainy day. Looking to make it the 12 miles to Tri-Corner Shelter, but could bail out at Peck's Corner Shelter at 7.4 mile mark.
Since I still had two pair of toe warmers I hadn't used yet, I thought today was a good day to be on the safe side and use one of them. By end of the 12 mile hike, my shoes and socks were pretty well soaked through from all the rain. The toe warmers didn't feel like they were still giving off heat when I took them off at end of day, but bottom line is that my feet and toes didn't feel cold while hiking throughout the day.
Arrived Tri-Corner Knob Shelter at 4:52 pm. It was a challenging day on trail. Cold and wet, mix of rain, sleet and snow not to mention some helacious wind on the ridges. Good thing rain stopped after a few hours. It was snowing as I was going to sleep and I wondered how much snow would be on the ground when I woke up in the morning.

Left Tri-Corner Knob Shelter at 12:13 pm. Took my time getting in trail because it was cold and I only had 7.7 miles to go to Cosby Knob Shelter. Got a couple inches of snow - not too bad. Should be fun hiking through that!
Arrived Cosby Knob Shelter at 4:20 pm. Trekked 7.7 miles in 2-3 inches of snow on trail. Started out around 26 degrees and didn't warm up much so no melting going on today. The challenging part of today's hike was getting around all the branches that were hung over onto trail from being weighed down by freezing rain.
Ten miles tomorrow and I'll be at Standing Bear Farm hostel for well-deserved rest.Fortitudine VincimusHarpo","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Left Cosby Knob Shelter at 10:19 am. Another cold night, but beautiful sunny day to hike out of Smokies.
It was cool to start out hiking in snow and fallen frozen rain and then gradually the trail just turned wet at lower elevations. I would estimate that only above 3500-4000 ft or so got freezing rain and snow.
Arrived at Davenport Gap at 4:16 pm - no ranger standing guard at the trailhead. That completed my 6 night/seven day trek of the Smokies without resupply. Then it was on to Standing Bear Farm arriving at 5:30 pm.
The top room of the treehouse at Standing Bear Farm was open, so I took it for $45/night. Got a DiGiorno pizza and a few beers and I was all set. The guys that worked the Farm got a good fire going and Mark played some cool stuff on his guitar while I played a couple of tunes on my harmonica. Marc is a pretty good harmonica player (although he didn't have one with him that night) so he gave me a few suggestions for playing.
