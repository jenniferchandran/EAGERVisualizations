HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625309,"So today I make it public.  It is my intention to thruhike the Appalachian Trail (aka the AT) from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine.  The trail goes through 14 States, and has a total hiking distance of approximately 2,200 Miles (to my Canadian friends, that’s 3,540 Kilometers).  If you add up all the ascents during the entire trail it is the equivalent of climbing Mt. Everest 17 times, or at least that’s the rumor.
Wait a minute, this sounds way too familiar.  I'm sure I've posted this before....
Oh that's right, just about a year ago.  I won't bother to re-post the details of my January 2019 adventure.  If you're interested go check out my 2019 thru-hike journal.
Instead, I'll let you know whats been happening since Janurary, and invite you to follow along with my 2020 adventure.",,View Entry,"Dec 10, Tue",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625310,"So here I am again, doing some Pre-Adventure hikes to test out my gear and my repaired leg.
As you have read about in my 2019 journal, I did a test hike on the Bruce Trail in September to test out the leg repair and found I was definitely able to hike again.  I must admit I was a little concerned, but Dr. Manwell (my Orthopedic Surgeon) was true to his word.  The leg really is as good as new.
In October Anita, Elizabeth and I decided to take a little family vacation to the Adirondacks in the great state of New York.  The plan was to do some hiking in ""Real"" mountains to make sure my leg was up to the task.  Our first hiking day was on October 26th, when all three of us summited Mount Van Hovenberg during just a day hike.  I carried a small light day pack which is nothing compared to my Altra 60.  The three of us had a delightful day and the weather was about as perfect as we could have asked for.  Today's photo is from the top of Mount Van Hovenberg.",,View Entry,"Dec 11, Wed",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625311,"On October 28th the three of us headed out hiking towards Marcy Dam.  The plan was for Anita to hike with Elizabeth and I up to that point and then she will turn around and go back to civilization, and Elizabeth and I will continue on for a three day adventure.  The weather was perfect and we enjoyed the hike to Marcy Dam where Anita turned around and headed back.  Elizabeth and I continued on and planned to overnight at the Feldspar camping area.  Although there is a lean-to there, we will be tenting, and this is a big change for me because I've never shared my tent with another person before this.  The young man who was manning the visitor center had told us about an area just before we would reach Feldspar called ""The Bog"".  He advised us to be careful crossing on the logs as they may sink a little when we stepped on them.  We soon discovered that this was the understatement of the century because when we got there those logs sank under even the slightest weight to a depth of around twelve inches before they found the bottom.  Needless to say our feet, socks and boots were soaked by the time we got across, and stayed that way for the next three days.  Even so, we laughed ourselves silly during and after the experience.  I have included some photos of the bog on the photos page.Once at Feldspar we got our camp all set up and did our nightly chores.  We managed to get ourselves organized into our sleeping bags with only one very small incident during which I managed to kick my dear daughter in the head.  Sorry Elizabeth, I assure you it was an accident.",,View Entry,"Dec 12, Thu",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625313,"Today is October 29th and it is to be our biggest hiking day of this trip.  The original plan was to hike about 20 miles and summit three high peaks today.  We broke camp and headed out early for our first destination, Gray Peak (elv. 4840 Ft).  This is the 7th highest peak in NY state and would be an out and back summit, meaning that we would drop our big packs near the base of the mountain and hike up to the summit and back down without packs.  The weather was cold and damp, but no rain or snow was falling.  The cold actually makes for easier hiking because you don't get overheated during the exertion of hiking up a mountain.  We hiked into the low lying clouds today and reached the summit without incident.  Once we returned to our packs we stopped for lunch, and to assess our progress.  We decided that it would be unwise to attempt all three peaks we had originally planned because it was taking more time than we had expected.  Therefore we decided to skip mount Skylight and head straight for Mount Marcy (elv. 5344 Ft).  Mount Marcy would be an up and over hike, meaning that we would be carrying our packs to the summit and down the other side.  Also, the summit of Mount Marcy is above the alpine region so there would be little vegetation to protect us from the cold wind, and we could expect to be hiking over ice and snow so our microspikes would be coming in handy.  And yes, those are the same microspikes I SHOULD have been wearing in January.  It was a real grind getting to the summit of Mount Marcy, and once there we found it was completely shrouded in thick fog so there were no views to be had.  There was a very strong wind blowing and it was well below freezing, so we didn't spend a lot of time on the summit.  I had selected two possible overnight campsites for us tonight, but once we arrived at the first one we decided to push on because there wasn't a good water supply nearby.  Unfortunately this meant we would be hiking into our campsite after dark.  The campsite for tonight was back at Marcy Dam where Anita had turned around two days ago, and once there we wasted no time getting set up and into our sleeping bags.  We were both exhausted to the point where we decided to just skip dinner and go to sleep.  Elizabeth was particularly pleased at our getting to this campsite because it meant Anita could hike in to meet us in the morning.  As Elizabeth and I were breaking camp in the morning of October 30th, Anita got to Marcy Dam to meet us before all three of us hiked back to the visitor center.I have gained a new appreciation for the use of hiking poles during this trip.   When you are carrying a large pack in the mountains they are not an option.  I now know they won't be spending much time strapped to my pack while on the AT.",,View Entry,"Dec 14, Sat",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625890,"People sometimes ask me why I love winter hiking so much. Today I came across this particularly beautiful scene as I was out hiking near our home, and realized that this is one of the reasons. 
Winter hiking has many advantages over summer hiking, but the beauty of snow is high on the list. Now if that’s not enough to get you out in the backcountry during the snowy months, how about the complete absence of bugs, no rain, no overwhelmingly hot or humid days, and the list goes on. It’s easy to add a few layers of clothing during the cold, but there’s a limit to what you can take off when the mercury rises. 
My AT thru hike is getting very real as the time gets closer. It is now less than three weeks before Anita and I head south to Georgia, and in my basement is a literal pile of resupply materials. I have been getting as much as I can ready before my departure so it will be easier for Anita to keep me provisioned during my adventure. 
I can’t wait to finally take my first step toward Katahdin.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Tue",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626054,"On Saturday evening my in-laws and their spouses had Anita and I over for a Hiker Send Off dinner. I was made to feel very special and genuinely appreciate all the effort that everyone put into this event. The food was spectacular and the english language has no adequate way to describe how wonderful the dessert was. 
As part of the evening I brought along three things that I am often asked about when my hike comes into conversation. My bear vault, my backpack, and a resupply box. The bear vault and resupply box were discussed at length, and then I was asked to show what was in my backpack. Now just to be clear, the backpack was set up for training hikes so the contents are not what I would normally carry on a real hike. It was brought so they could pick it up and feel the weight and see how the weight is distributed when worn correctly. The laughter that ensued when I started pulling out cast iron exercise weights was absolutely priceless. 
I will remember this special evening long into my hike, and will use the memory to help pick me up when I get dragged down. Thank You to all who took part in making this event  something to remember.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Sat",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626081,"So today I finished up my packing, and not only is my backpack ready but also four weeks of additional resupply. The boxes have been checked and rechecked, labeled and then checked again. We won’t be sealing them closed because there remains a few food items that we will need to get once we cross the border into the USA. There are strict rules concerning meats and dairy items that we don’t want to take a chance of having a problem with at the border. We also want it to to be very easy for the border inspection to see what’s in the boxes and not give the impression we’re trying to hide something. Each box will also have a complete packing list in case there are any questions. 
I have been working diligently on my honey do list of pre hike jobs and today I stroked off the last thing on the list. Yesterday I did the deed and purchased my medical insurance for while I’m on the trail. As a Canadian, additional medical insurance is a must just in case the unexpected happens. Our Ontario government insurance is great while we’re in Ontario but it doesn’t do much when we’re out of Canada. 
So I think I’m ready. Three days to drive down to Amicalola Falls, two days there getting oriented and then on Wednesday February 12th I take my first step on the approach trail. 
I just can’t believe it’s finally my time.",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Thu",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626134,"Well my time is finally here. Anita and I arrived at Amicalola Falls Lodge today. Despite the rain, we went out and did a little easy hiking, sporting our umbrellas. I have decided to slack pack the first 1.1 miles of the approach trail tomorrow because the wood planks in the steps are deathly slippery with all the rain. So tomorrow morning I will register at the visitor center, get my official hang tag, and then start hiking up to the lodge without my pack. On Wednesday morning I will leave my lovely wife at the Lodge, put on my pack and head north to the summit of Springer Mountain. Anita will drive South to Florida. 
Then on Thursday morning I start this epic journey to Katahdin.",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Mon",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626161,"And so begins the adventure of my life. I am NOBO thruhiker tag #123.
I started out under the iconic arch at the Visitor Center carrying a day pack, and although my plan yesterday was to hike only to the top of the falls, plans are only guidelines right? After reviewing the options and road crossings, Anita and I decided that the High Shoals road crossing would be an acceptable pickup and drop off location. Before I left however, we drove to the spot to ensure the road was open after all this rain (It was). 
So I actually hiked 3.1 miles with a total ascent of 1455 feet today, and I feel GREAT.  Tomorrow Anita will drop me back off at the same road crossing, this time with my full pack, and then get on the road to Florida. I will hike 6 miles to the summit of Springer Mountain (Elevation 3780 ft). 
Oh, and for my very observant friends out there, yes this photo was staged, that’s definitely NOT just a day pack, LOL.",,View Entry,"Feb 11, Tue",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626169,"This morning Anita dropped me off at the High Shoals Road crossing, and after a slightly teary moment we hugged a long hug and said our goodbyes. I am already missing her.As of today I am officially counting miles toward my AT thru hike. I summited Springer Mountain and have now started the white blazed trail toward Katahdin. 
Today I hiked approximately 6 miles with a total ascent of 1850 ft, but only 0.2 miles will count toward my thru hike, with the rest being on the approach trail. 
Currently I am hunkered down keeping dry in my tent behind the Springer Mountain Shelter along with three other thru hikers. We had all originally decided to stay in the shelter but there is soooo much fog and mist blowing into it everything was getting wet within minutes of setting up. We all agreed that nobody was interested in waking up to a drenched down sleeping bag so we all relocated to our tents. 
It’s been raining off and on most of the day today but was still a pleasant enough hike due to the relatively warm weather. All in All I’m very happy to be here and look forward to tomorrow.","Springer Mountain

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626224,"OMG. What a night. 
We were all very happy with our decision to relocate into our tents by this morning. We had an absolutely wicked storm last night with crazy winds, thunder, lightning, and rain by the bucketload. The winds were so bad I actually got up in the middle of the night to put tent pegs into the stay ropes on the sides of my tent, something I have never felt the need to do before this. I think I might have gotten 3 - 4 hours of sleep, and that’s being generous. 
I was very fortunate to have managed to stay relatively dry all night l, but the same can’t be said for Pat, Thomas and Jolene. These are the other three thru hikers that were here tonight. Pat described his tent as a small lake, and Jolene said theirs was a little wet. 
Due to the rain this morning I didn’t get on the trail until about 10:00. Just getting water from the stream was a real chore because all the pathways were under water. I had to pack up a wet tent because it was still raining a little. 
So once I got on the trail I didn’t waste a lot of time hiking to Hawk Mountain Shelter and the first job was to set up my tent to let it air dry. The same four hikers are here plus about four more. Thomas, Jolene and Pat are going to try the Shelter again but I’m hunkered down in my tent. The temperature has dropped precipitously to 30 degrees F, but it feels much colder when I’m out in the wind.","Springer Mountain Shelter

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626225,"It was a late morning getting onto the trail again this morning. After the freezing overnight temperature last night I found that although I had slept with my water filter to protect if from freezing, I had neglected to protect my water bladder. Fortunately the bladder itself didn’t freeze but the drinking tubes did. As a result I had to take some time to thaw them out before refilling the bladder. 
I hiked 7.6 Miles today with a total ascent of 1850 feet. About half way through I needed to break down and take a second vitamin I ( ibuprofen) as my legs were beginning to ache. It did the trick and the last half went along pain free. I think I’ll take a second one tomorrow morning just before  getting on the trail as it will be a tough hike tomorrow. Thomas and Jolene arrived here just before I did, and Pat showed up with a new friend Kathy. 
I’m missing my sweetheart more than I expected , and I’m already looking forward to our reunion in Hiawassee. 
Today as I was hiking I came across Jolene on her hands and knees on a log in the middle of a stream crossing, and she was obviously in distress. I assisted her in getting back to my side of the stream and after she insisted, I went on across. I soon realized that her trekking poles were too short to reach the bottom of the stream so she couldn’t use them to steady herself as she crossed. I tossed my poles over the stream for her to use and she was soon across without incident. One very small kindness to another human being, something this world could use more of.","Hawk Mountain Shelter
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Feb 14, Fri",7.60
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626226,"So I stayed in the shelter last night, my first time ever. It was comfortable enough and dry, but I found it colder than my tent would have been. A shelter is a structure with either one or two levels but only three walls. The levels are just a flat wood platform where you can roll out your own sleep system. It offers some protection from the wind but not much due to the open front and air vents in the back. I was on the upper level along with Thomas and Jolene, and there is absolutely no privacy other than what your sleeping bag offers. As a relatively private person I found this a little disconcerting, but soon got over it.  I slept fairly well until about 5:30 AM when my bladder just wouldn’t wait any longer. It wasn’t a real problem as I had my alarm set for 5:45 anyways. I did Most of my morning routine by headlamp so I could be on the trail by sunrise. This was necessary today as I had a big hike to do. I hiked 12 miles plus 1/2 mile from the main trail to the shelter, with a total ascent of 3,000 feet. The 1/2 mile doesn’t count toward my thruhike, as only AT trail miles do.  The 3000 foot ascent is far far more than I have ever done in one day and I’m feeling it tonight. 
During this entire hike I have been amazed by these little ice formations on the ground in patches shown in today’s photo. They look like little ice flowers, but I think they are formed as the ground freezes and forces the water in it to rise to the surface where it freezes and is pushed up by more water coming up from below. I know the photo probably doesn’t do them justice because they are really quite beautiful. 
So now I’m at Woods Hole Shelter hunkered down in my tent staying warm as the temperature has dropped below freezing again. Lucky for me the shelter was already full when I arrived. I am sleeping with my water filter system, my bladder drinking tubes and all my electronics in my sleeping bag. It’s getting a little crowded in here.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626244,"Last night was an interesting night. The tenting locations were far from ideal, and I eventually set up on a site that was far from level. All night my sleeping bag kept sliding down towards my feet and running into the end of the tent. I would shimmy it back up and in a few hours it had slid down again. It was aggravating especially since my sleeping pad was doing the same thing. A double wammy.  I skipped lunch preparations this morning, but more on that later. 

The first part of my hike this morning was to climb Blood Mountain, the tallest summit in the State of Georgia. I have now summited the tallest mountain in two states. The climb up was actually easier than I thought it would be. I guess after reading other hikers describe it I was prepared for the worst and it never materialized. Unfortunately, as was the case in New York, the summit was completely socked in with fog and there were no views to be had.
My hike today took me through the infamous Neels Gap. In the hiker world this is the most amazing place, and I now understand why. They treat stinky sweaty hikers just like anyone else, maybe even better. They have an outfitters store, an AT memorabilia store, a pantry where they sell various hiker foods, and various sandwiches and other food you can buy. I selected a pepperoni pizza from the freezer and one of the employees just took it away from me and took it out back to heat up. I had a nice chat with him as the pizza oven did it’s thing and found out he had thruhiked the AT a few years ago. With that and many section hikes he has accumulated over 10,000 miles on the AT. 
He accepted the $10.00 bill and returned the $5.00 bill even though the total was $10.79.  Later I went to the cash register to pay for a coffee and he told me it was on the house for thruhikers. 
I can tell you never has any pizza tasted as good as this one did as I scarfed it down along with the Root Beer. 
After leaving Neels Gap I continued North along the AT and unfortunately missed a turn, and ended up hiking down a sheer rock face. I got about 75 feet down it when I realized there were no White blazes that are traditionally painted on the rock, and if this rock was wet it would be virtually impassible. I stopped and got out Guthook and soon realized I was off trail and the only way back to the trail was climbing right back up the rock face. I succeeded without any disaster, but lesson learned. 
I am now camped out at Baggs Creek Gap, my first “unofficial camp site”. It has a piped spring for water but no shelter, privy or bear box. Mark and Marcella are also here but the rest of my tramily stayed overnight at Neels Gap. Mark and Marcella were at Woods Hole Shelter last night as well, and are doing a three day hike.","Woods Hole Shelter

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626290,"I wrote my post last night as I always do in “Notes” on my iPhone and then once completed I took my phone off “Airplane” mode to upload the post to the trailjournals website. I keep my phone on airplane mode to conserve battery power and only connect when I need to for a specific task. 
Almost immediately I received a text message from my sister who lives near where I live telling me that my mother is in hospital and on life support. Although we have known this was a possibility for several years, it was not expected now as she had just recovered nicely from a medical problem and was to be sent home last Friday.  Although the connection was very bad my Sister and I talked about the situation and I believe I must return home to be there for her. 
So this morning I got packed up and hiked South back to Neels Gap where Anita will pick me up tomorrow, and then we head back to Canada. 
Today’s photo is of a tree outside the outfitters at Neels Gap. This is the point where a lot of potential thruhikers give up and go home, but before they leave they tie the laces of their hiking shoes together and throw them into this tree, to state with absolutely clarity that they are finished. 
I thought that this photo was very appropriate today because my boots have NOT been tossed into the tree. I have not given up on my dream, but merely put it on hold until Mom is looked after. 
To all my followers, friends and relatives I once again say to you “I will be back”.","Baggs Creek Gap

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626993,"First and foremost I would like to sincerely thank everyone who signed my guestbook and provided a host of warm wishes and prayers for my mother.  I know she is looking down happily on me as I return to the trail, and will be following along from above with every step I take. This morning Anita dropped me off at Neels Gap and I headed North, over the same trail section that I hiked four weeks ago. My total distance today was 11.4 miles with a total ascent of 2950 feet. However because I had already hiked the first 4 miles, only 7.4 miles count toward my thruhike.The weather was not pleasant today as it was foggy and rainy all day. The fog blocked any views there might have been. The trail was very muddy and even with my tall gaiters my hiking pants are still muddy up over the knee.I did come across some tulips growing in the most unexpected place up on top of a mountain so I snapped a picture of them and have added it to my photo page. What a difference from four weeks ago. During my first 5 days of hiking 4 weeks ago, there were perhaps an average of 5 people at the overnight locations. Tonight at Low Gap the shelter is full with about 7 people and there are at least 25 tents scattered around the shelter area. The reason I started my thruhike in mid February was to get ahead of this bubble of hikers, but now I find myself right in the middle of it.  The best laid plans ....","Neels Gap

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627024,"Again today was totally fogged in and there were absolutely no views to be had. I hiked a total of 7.3 miles with a total ascent of 1530 feet. I had hoped to continue on to the next shelter but realized that the next 6 miles are going to be brutal, complete with two very steep 1000 foot climbs. So I decided to overnight here at the Blue Mountain Shelter and tackle the two big climbs tomorrow on fresher legs. Again tonight the shelter which is supposed to hold 7 is housing more like 9 hikers and there are about 20 tents here. Today’s photo is of one side of the shelter, and my tent is the black one on the left side. There are two army buddies staying here tonight and one of them pulled the funniest practical joke on his buddy. Now to put it in perspective, you must realize that this is a backcountry site with no access other than the trail. So one of these two told his buddy that there was a pizza order being planned at the shelter and if he wanted in he better get over there and give them some cash.  His buddy had been talking for hours about being hungry and he bought right in to the story, and practically ran over to the shelter and asked who he needed to pay for the pizza. Needless to say there was a lot of laughter over the joke, all in good fun of course.","Low Gap Shelter

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627059,"I slept in a little this morning because the weather was terrible. It rained heavily all night and the fog was so thick it made it difficult to see even using my headlamp. I left the shelter at about 9:30 AM and headed north. I knew today was going to be a tough day with 2 very steep climbs of over 1000 feet and those climbs didn’t disappoint. Today I hiked 8.1 miles with a total ascent of 2897 feet. About half way through the hike today I came across my first trail magic. A church had set up a tent at a road crossing and was just starting to cook up hamburgers and hotdogs, along with cold drinks and a big propane heater to warm up the hikers. I chose to drink half of my hot chocolate. I did enjoy the nice comfy chairs they had put around the heater. Unfortunately it started to rain before the burgers were ready so I decided to move on. After all, I still had another mountain to get over. Last night I met a hiker calling himself “donut”. He is a very fine young man who freely admits to being a little overweight. He is a good hiker and I found myself leapfrogging with him most of today. There was a point today during a relatively flat area when donut was about 1/4 mile behind me, and suddenly I could hear the most beautiful opera music being sung behind me. I had a difficult time associating that voice with donut so when we met back up again I asked if it was him. He rather sheepishly admitted that it was and that he broke out into song sometimes when he was struggling with his hike. I told him how much I enjoyed the beautiful sound coming up the mountain. It almost seems a shame that someone with such a beautiful voice is going to school to become a lawyer.Near the end of my hike today, the sun finally broke through and the day became just beautiful. The first priority when I got here to the shelter was to set up my tent and try to get as many things dried out as I could. Fortunately I was successful and all my gear is now dry, not clean but at least dry.","Blue Mountain Shelter

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627121,"Last night at about 5:00 AM nature called and I had to make a trip to the privy. This isn’t uncommon these days, but what I saw on my return to my tent certainly was. Across the valley next to my tent were thousands of lights stretching as far as my eye could see. It was breathtaking, and made me realize that no matter how much we thruhikers think we are in the backcountry, civilization really isn’t that far away. Today I hiked 7.9 miles with a total ascent of 1850 feet. That sounds like a relatively easy day and mostly it was. However there was a section that I climbed over 1000 feet in less than 1 mile. That hike up to Kelly Knob was in my opinion the hardest climb so far on the trail. This morning I awoke to a wet tent again due to the heavy fog and mist overnight. I guess dry isn’t the name of the game this hike. I prepared my breakfast but no lunch today as I’m having to ration my dwindling food supply. I have added 1 day of hiking before my next resupply and that has stretched my supplies a little. Not enough to worry about because I had cheese and a snack bag for lunch.Today’s photo is a sample of the mushrooms I have noticed all along the trail. They come in a huge variety of sizes and shapes and are quite pretty. Tomorrow I get picked up by the Budget Inn shuttle at Dicks Creek Gap for a night in a real bed, a hot shower, and to pick up my resupply.

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627123,"Last night I slept on the second level of the shelter at Deep Gap and what a good choice that was. Everyone on the lower level ended up with wet sleeping bags due to the fog drifting in the front opening. I am so glad I decided to go to the upper level despite hitting my head on the rafters countless times.Today’s photo is of the first sunrise I have witnessed this entire hike and it was glorious. It would mark the beginning of a truly perfect hiking day, well almost perfect. This morning I left the shelter at 8:00 AM in order to be at Dicks Creek Gap by 11:15 for my shuttle pickup. That distance should really only take about 2 hours but I wanted to leave a little extra time just in case. Am I ever glad I did because I made my first bonehead mistake and ended up needing every minute of that extra time. As I came up the side trail from the shelter I turned the wrong way on the main trail and ended up going South for 0.9 miles, on a very steep incline. So I ended up hiking an extra 1.8 miles that I can’t count, and due to that error I just squeaked in about 5 minutes before the shuttle arrived.  So today I hiked 5.4 miles with a total ascent of 1280 feet, but only 3.6 of the miles count toward my thruhike. Now I am relaxing at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee, a motel that goes the extra mile to attract hikers including a free shuttle pickup and drop off. I have completed my laundry, had a much needed shower, had a delicious pizza from Marcos, and picked up my first resupply box. Tomorrow, if all goes well I cross my first state line, say goodbye to Georgia and hello to North Carolina.","Deep Gap Shelter

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627228,"On Thursday afternoon, after repacking my bearvault and backpack with all the new provisions from the resupply box in preparation to hike on, I decided to sit and take stock of all the information I had regarding the coronavirus issue. I knew that like all other thruhikers, I had received an email from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy imploring all hikers to please get off the trail now and go home. I knew that the Canadian Government was strongly urging all Canadians that were abroad to come home as soon as possible, even if that meant cutting their trips short. I knew that the US and Canadian Governments had jointly made the decision to close the US-Canadian border to all but “essential travel”.  I knew that I had emailed the Canadian Consulate in Washington DC explaining my situation and they had responded that I should return to Canada sooner rather than later. They informed me that while I could get a flight back to Canada now, flights we’re getting difficult to book and they couldn’t give me any assurance of my ability to get home beyond the next few days. I had no choice but to accept as fact that if I continued my hike, I may find myself unable to return home at a future date. And so it was with a heavy heart I made my decision to abandon my hike and attempt to get home. It took calls to at least 10 shuttle services before I could find a ride to the Atlanta Airport. Thank You to Donald and Mary from “The Further Shuttle” for going above and beyond the call of duty and getting me to the airport very early on Friday morning. There were only 2 Air Canada flights going to Toronto on Friday and I had booked the later flight. Upon my arrival at the airport, I was informed that the earlier flight had already been cancelled. I waited many hours for my flight to board all the while wondering if it too would be cancelled. I am happy to report that my flight left Atlanta on time and arrived in Toronto at about 9:15 PM, as scheduled. My trip through Customs and Immigration went smoothly, and my backpack survived its trip through the baggage system unscathed. I am now starting my government mandated 14 days of self-isolation at home, and the more news I get regarding the AT, the more I know I made the right decision. So that ends my AT thruhike attempt for 2020, as I believe this pandemic has really only just begun and will get much worse before it gets any better. Over the next few months I will be doing much soul searching before I decide whether or not to attempt it again. If I do, I will create yet a third journal on this site. It is said that the third times the charm.....",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Fri",0
