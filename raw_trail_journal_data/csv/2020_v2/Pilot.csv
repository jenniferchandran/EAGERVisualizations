Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/364428,"With 2012 seeming right around the corner, I have at least the dates and general plans scoped out for my 2012 AT hikes. I decided to start a new journal this year Vs carrying over my old one as the number of entries were getting too long and managing pictures was becoming problematic from my Droid phone.2012 in some respects represents a new phase in my AT hikes. Having done from Rangeley Maine all the way down to DWG on the PA side - my hikes are getting further and further away from home and every trip from here on out will be more challenging logistically given the distance just to get to the trail. 
I will also be hiking this year with a new friend, Greenie, who I ironically first met many years ago doing the Presidential range on a hut to hut hike with the scouts - and in some of the worst weather I have EVER hiked. I met Greenie again via the AMC on a day hike we did together and then two section hikes on the LT. Superman and Wingman may make part of my hikes this year - but that has not come together yet.
As I close in on 2013, and my goal of completing half the trail by the end of that year I am also getting close to my target year, 2014, to try to finish the balance of the trail. It still remains to be seen if I will hit my goal, but I continue to work toward that reality and await to see how things play out.
My plans for 2012 are to hike PA from DWG to at least Port Clinton. On the Maine side in September I will complete from Rangeley to Caratunk. Both sections will be difficult so I am still keeping my daily miles down based on what I will find on the ground...like rocks and difficult footing. If the trail turns out to be kinder, then I will do more miles - but I would rather be realistic and enjoy the ride Vs being a mileage hound and not enjoying my time of the trail.","

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/378799,"Greetings!Later this week Greenie and I will head down to PA to take on the dreaded rocks of Pennsylvania! We will be covering the section of trail between Port Clinton and DWG over several days - the first of which will be simple slack packs with my Sister and her boyfriend to get us into the rhythm of the trail.The days will break out in terms of miles as follows if everything flows as planned:6.4 miles9.8 miles17.4 miles12.8 miles10.8 miles13.8 miles - and -6.4 milesIf the week turns out anything like NJ did last year, I am sure we will make some modifications based on the weather and our pace. Last year, rain kept us moving in order to hit towns to get out of the crappy weather - and hopefully this year we will catch a break in terms of rain. I shouldn't say this as not to jinx our hike, since last year when I made the comment that the only place I did not want rain was Mahoosuc Notch - and that was what we got...pouring, soaking, cold and miserable rain... but the only place I hope the weather is cooperative is LeHigh Gap. Rock scrambles and extreme exposure in conjunction with bad weather (especially thunderstorms) is not a good combination and would cause us to modify our hike.Otherwise, I am really looking forward to this trip. I have been training as always including a recent short jaunt on the AT out in the October Mountain State Forest leading an AMC trip of folks new to backpacking (pictured above). I met a hiker at the Kay Wood shelter doing a flip-flop that started at Port Clinton a few months ago - he termed hiking that section heading north as more like ""stepping"" than hiking.At any rate, the trail is what the trail will be and I will make the most of what it tosses in my direction.","Home

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/379926,"We got a late start today and did not hit the trail until 11:00 AM. After spotting a car near the side trail to Windsor Furnace, we drove down to port Clinton and began our walk for the day. It was about 87 degrees by the time we got started, so it was slow going in the initial 700 foot out of Port Clinton.   Shortly after reaching the ridge line, we stopped to eat lunch and hydrate The trail today was easy with few patches of rocks. Much of the day followed an old woods road and while the views were limited, the forest was beautiful.We stopped at Pocahontas Spring and watered up. The spring was flowing well and was clear and cool. Later we passed Minnehaha Spring which was not as nice. Before Windsor Furnace we crossed a nice stream flowing vigorously. A thru hiker by the name of Haystack was sitting by the stream fiddling with his cell phone. We stopped and talked for a minute and then walked on.We got back to the car just as a thunder storm was brewing up. We are staying at Pamelas bed and breakfast in Kempton tonight and will get an earlier start Sunday.","Port Clinton, Pa

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/379984,"Rained like crazy last night but we were comfortable in the carriage house at the B&B. We were up early and had breakfast at 7:30. After finishing breakfast the inn lost power, but since we had already eaten and had our coffee it was not an issue. We were on the trail shortly after 9:00 and made great time to pulpit rock where the views were slightly shrouded by wispy clouds. We walked over to the astronomical observatory where we saw a couple of large black snakes. The hike to the pinnacle was fairly easy with only occasional Section of famous Pennsylvania rocks. We stopped at the pinnacle for lunch and the continued on. The trail was an easy old woods road with mild rocks and stones. We met up with a group coming off of one of the side trails who turned out to be from the Delaware AMC chapter doing a training hike for a trip to the whites in July. After stopping to talk we continued on. We made it to the car by about 2:30. Greenie ran ahead to the shelter to get a spot for is (which he later moved to pitching his tent for some reason).We are at the shelter with Arizona, Hay Stack (who is from Quincy Mass), baked beans and one big surprise, Stumpknocker. Right now it is threatening to storm again. Greenie may regret moving to his tent and Stumpknocker had a large branch crash through his tent in the storm last night. Tomorrow, we are all moving North so the week should prove fun with a great crew of northbounders.","Windsor furnace

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/380124,"To say today was tough would be an understatement. We were up and on the trail by 6:25 to beat the heat of the day. Arizona left at the same time as we did and the only one out before us was Stumpknocker. Arizona stayed with us for about the first half hour and then kicked it up a notch. We did not see him the balance of the day.We made the Allentown hiking club shelter by 10:00 and felt really good about having done 7.4 miles by that time. We had some really nice sections today with wide open woods roads but the we had some nasty sections with big rock jumbles that really slowed us down. We started referring to the harder sections as ""rock dances"". We made the New Tripoli camp site by 1:00 where we broke for lunch, to dry some of our gear out and to water up. After lunch the heat of the day really intensified making the idea of keeping a good pace unlikely.We traverse the appropriately named knife edge section and finally made it to bake oven knob which was a nasty boulder scramble adding insult to injury where we were now really tapped out and very hot. We pulled into the shelter at 4:00, hot and spent from todays miles and excessive heat. Tomorrow we will need to be up and out early again to beat the weather and clear LeHigh Gap before weather sets in.","Eckville shelter

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/380249,"We were up and out early again this morning knowing that we could be up for thunderstorms around mid-day. After having our breakfast, we watered up and hit the trail by 7:00. We tented last night across the AT in a clearing above the shelter. It was a perfect spot as we had a breeze most of the night and no company. The tenting spot next to the shelter had a big old widow maker of a tree and I was not about to tent there.We started off with a rock dance, but the trail took a turn for the sweet, nice and beautiful! We had all sorts of mountain laurel of all colors, fields of ferns and more. We saw a large doe at one point just staring at us from a position of about 20 or 30 feet from the trail. We made the next shelter by about 10:00 making great time with the beautiful trail. After a break and watering up we continued on. We made LeHigh Gap in no time. The heat of the day was building as we began the climb.There was more shade than expected on the way up, but when we hit the exposed section it was absolutely roasting.We stopped for some pictures and kept walking. A section of the AT is re-routed after the north end of the winter trail taking us along the side of the mountain range on an open grass covered road way. We stopped on the trail in a shady spot to have lunch.After lunch we continued on when Greenie all of a sudden jumped back. A large timber rattlesnake was right in the middle of the grass road and right where we could not go around it. We waited as it moved off the road and then ran like hell as far from it on the opposite edge of the road.We passed through the Palmerton super fund site which was largely denuded of vegetation. We expected another spring to draw water, but found none. We were almost out of water when we popped out at Little Gap at 2:30 well ahead of expectations. There at the trail head was a cooler with beer in it. Greenie's first trail magic!We are now in Filbert's bed and breakfast in Danielsville, clean and content. Tomorrow we have a short day so we will take a later start. Now for dinner and relaxation!","Bake Oven knob shelter
",Little Gap,"May 29, Tue",12.80
Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/380369,"What a difference a day makes! Today was soooo much cooler and comfortable in terms of temps. We were up and moving a little later given the short day. Kathy at Filberts B&B served us breakfast at 8:00 consisting of fruit cup, coffee, four eggs (farm fresh) scrambled with cheese, farm fresh Bacon, sausage, French toast, hash browns and toast! We were dropped off at the trail at 9:00 and began walking north. We had a 400' climb out of the gap and a short rock dance. After that the trail was flat and easy with occasional rock waltzs. We stopped at an overlook and took some pictures. There was a section hiker there with his dog who spent the night in the awful storm. We spoke to him and then went on.We stopped at Smith Gap road for lunch. A Biologist doing studies on timber rattlers stopped and asked us if we had seen any, but during our conversation he got a call which ended the discussion.We met up with a northbounder at the side trail to the shelter by the name of Orange lightening who works at Saracuse University (he maintains the lights at the sport facilities), spoke for a while and moved on. The shelter is a bit worn considering it was built in 1982, but with the wood ticks we are now finding it was not a tough decision to tent camp tonight. Several NOBO thru hikers are here tonight including Baked Beans who we now have met up with three times at shelters, several hikers we have not met, and an AT ridge runner. It seems that Massachusetts is well represented tonight with several of us from the area at the shelter.Tomorrow is a 13.8 mile day and the back of my left knee is a little ""off"" so I hope it will not be a problem tomorrow. The weather is looking fantastic until we get off the trail on Friday. I am hoping that the trip finishes as well as it has gone up to this point.","Little Gap
",Leroy A Smith shelter,"May 30, Wed",10.80
Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/380512,"This morning we were up and out by 7:20 making our way north. The weather today was the pick of the trip with low humidity and cooler temps. We took the time to stop at some of the overlooks as we headed north, not feeling rushed by the weather or our schedule.The one thing I can say about today is that the rocks were in their full glory. We pounded through mile after mile of nasty footing with little respite.We stopped in Wind Gap to water up at a motel near the trail at 10:00. I wanted an ice cream but they had sold out with the recent heat. Greenie tried to buy a soda, and after several tries ended up with a sprite as they were out of most flavors. After watering up and resting we were on our way. We met up with Beowuf who we met at the shelter last night. We hop-scotched each other for a while and then he pulled ahead of us to stay.Northbounders are pushing for DWG to take in the Thursday night free feed at the Church of the Mountain so all of the NOBO guys we saw last night are in the same mode.We encountered a spring marked on the trail before wolf rocks that was not on the map. Greenie got some water and we moved on. At Wolf rocks we took a break. The Turkey Vultures were winging on the up-drafts as we sat. Baked Beans past us as we stopped to talk to some hikers at Fox Gap. We put into the shelter by 3:15 and after looking for, and not finding a place to tent, we put into the shelter for the night.Tomorrow DWG and home. It has been a fantastic week at every turn. Greenie marvelled at the fact we never used our rain gear the entire week as I wrote this entry. Sometimes things just work out without a hitch!","Leroy A Smith shelter
",Kirkridge Shelter,"May 31, Thu",13.80
Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/380939,"To our surprise, Haystack arrived last night at around sunset. It seems that he was in Palmerton and caught a ride from a guy that convinced him it was best to not take on Lehigh Gap on his own and dropped him at Wind Gap instead. Haystack took it as a sign that his trail angel would consider it too dangerous given the heat and number of snakes in that area to do on his own - so he took the advice and decided he would go back at a later date in cooler weather and do that section at the end of his thru-hike.We also had the undesired company of some (drunken) local Yahoo's lighting off fireworks at about 11:30 last night near the shelter. As it turned out the Ridge Runner responsible for that section of trail had them stop their antics, but opted to spend the night in his car rather than scare the heck out of us sleeping in the shelter last night by arriving so late. He arrived at the shelter in the morning and sat with us while we prepared our packs and ate our breakfast.After sleeping in until after 6:00 this morning and taking our time to get up and out, we hit the trail at almost 8:00 - the latest start we had on the trail since last Saturday when we started his trip. We said our goodbyes to the Ridge Runner and Haystack and headed north.We crossed a nice grassy opening where the Yahoo's had gear strewn about like a tornado had hit a camping area, took note of the view east, and moved on. We passed lunch rocks but did not stop to take a look.As we made our way toward DWG, the trail turned to a nice open woods road - what a pleasurable way to finish this trip Vs having our feet banged around any further by rocks.We stopped at some of the overlooks and took some pictures while we enjoyed the beautiful morning. High clouds were working their way into the morning sky, forboding rain which was forecast for later in the day. We would be well on our way home before any weather would hit the area.We passed a nice area near Mt. Minsi where some folks were camped and began our descent into DWG. We passed through some magnificant Rhododendron tunnels where the blooms were still tightly closed but Mountain Laurel were in various stages of display.We passed a few day hikers heading south and Greenie made note that he could smell their soapy cleanliness for a long time after thay had passed us.Emerging onto Lake Road we made our way to a friends house where my sister had left my car earlier in the week after she left us on Sunday.I can truly say that I enjoyed the northern 1/3rd of PA even in spite of the rocks. We had so many areas of easy trail and beautiful things to see mixed with some great encounters with other hikers.Next, off to Maine in the fall to continue my journey north to Caratunk. I would like to add one last comment regarding the conclusion of this hike - That is, when I got home, I tossed my boots in the trash. The soles took a real beating to the point that they were coming off in places. I wear Keen boots, which are not exactly known for their ""durability"".  As they say - Pennsylvania is where boots go to die!","Kirkridge Shelter

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/391495,"Greenie and I stayed at the Sterling Inn on Friday night and were up and out early to catch the first ferry over the Kennebec River at 9:00 AM Saturday morning it was a gradual climb from the river as we headed south bound to West carry pond shelter. We passed several NOBO hikers on their way to catch the ferry along the way.We stopped to take in the river several times as there were many places, including a magnificent falls to stop. We passed Pierce Pond and Pierce Pond shelter but did not stop. After Bates Ridge we were approaching a main logging road where we were thinking of having lunch, but opted to stop at a beautiful (new) boardwalk over a wet area near a small pond. The dragonflies were methodically cruising the area eating bugs near where we sat and ate our lunch. I related the story about dragonflies to Greenie that our minister told at my Dads memorial service. I guess my Dad was here with me at this spot he would have so enjoyed.We passed around East Carry pond passing a group of college students from Colby out for freshmen orientation. Some of them would be at West Carry Pond Shelter tonight while the rest would continue to Pierce Pond Shelter. We mad the shelter shortly after 3:00. I guess the pace was too fast for Greenie as one of his knees was painfully stiff. I was worked he would not be able to finish the trip, but after resting and taking some vitamin I he was ok. We bedded down before dark ending a long but fantastic day.","Caratunk US 201
",West Carry Pond Shelter,"Sep 01, Sat",14
Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/391496,"We were up and out by 7:30 this morning. We worked our way around the edge of the pond and started our first climb of the day over Round Top Mountain. We made Long Falls Dam Road in short order and stopped to stretch on the side of the road. Some lady came along in a Prius and gave us a odd look as we sat and stretched sitting on the side of the road ( or more accurately sitting on the road).The road has been recently re-paved, so some scratched in the road surface ""2000 +/- "" noting that this is about 2000 miles from Springer Mountain in Georgia.passing Flagstaff Lake we stopped at a rocky beach area to take in the lake, but these strange white flies came in on us in mass and drove us back into the woods to avoid their bite. We stopped at little Bigelow lean-to for lunch. This is one shelter I must come back to and spend the night someday. We drew water from ""the tubs"" and moved on after lunch. The climb up little Bigelow Mountain gave some fantstic views of Flagstaff Lake which is massive. We thought we could see Katahdin as we looked north. The vistas of Bigelow Mountain put into perspective how hard but rewarding our hike tomorrow will be.  The hike into Safford Notch reminded me of Mahoosuc Notch as you have to walk through a large boulder cave at the entrance of to the notch to get to the camp grounds. We selected a spot at the back of the camping area near the water source where there were tent platforms and some hardened ground pads. Greenie took a platform while I tented on one of the padsAs of this moment i am sitting in my tent at Safford Notch camp site getting ready to turn in for the night. Today was stellar. I hope tomorrow brings that and more as we work our way into Stratton and the ultimately to Rangeley.","West Carry Pond Shelter

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/391691,"We were up and out on the trail at 7:30 AM. We wound our way around massive glacial boulders as we began our climb of Bigelow mountain. As we ascended we could see that all of the valleys as far as the eye could see were filled with clouds. The mountains appeared to be floating in an ocean of clouds. We reached Avery peak at about 9:00 and took our time to drink in the views. We stopped at the Avery camp site to draw water from one of the ""water boxes"" built around a water seep and then move on. This camp site is one place I need to visit again someday. We then summit the even higher west peak at 4,145 feet and started down toward south horn and the horns pond lean-to. When we reached south Horn it was noon, and I was absolutely famished so we stopped to have lunch and dry out our feet and shirts from sweating. At the horns pond shelter, the caretaker urged us to visit the pond which we did and then went on our way. The climb down was long and at times difficult with boulder jumbles and loose soil in places. Our legs took a pounding with the steep climb down, but the trail finally leveled off and we reached Maine 27 at 3:30. Both Greenie and I ran out of adjectives to describe all we saw today. This mountain range rivals the Whites in many ways. Tomorrow we are going to slack pack from Caribou Valley Road back to Stratton to avoid the predicted storm from the remains of the hurricane. We will figure out Wednesday when we have a better fix on the weather.","Safford Notch Campsite

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/391796,"So today we caught a shuttle from Sue to Caribou Valley Road where we slack packed back to ME 27 and ultimately back to Stratton.As it turns out Sue (not the same as Susan that owns the motel) used to live on the Cape and is dating a guy originally from there. We got on the trail around 10:15 AM and began with a moderate climb that became a stiff climb after the Crocker Cirque campsite. There were some boulder scrambles but nothing too difficult. We made the summit of South Crocker mountain before noon and after descending into the col between the north and south peaks we stopped for lunch in a small glade along the trail.At the north peak I commented that one of the cloud formations looked like a shark. Greenie humored me telling me that I had been in the woods too long. This section of trail could have been anywhere given there were not many views and the hemlocks had grown into the trail. As we made our way north we started catching glimpses of the twin peaks of Bigelow mountain to which Greenie comment that he thought they looked like a perfect set of boobs. It told HIM that I think he has been in the woods too long....we chuckled about our ""visions"" in the woods for a long time after. For a while the hike was easy and we both got into our zones as we wound through the forest. We finished by 2:45 and called Susan for our ride back to the motel. Tomorrow we will head out around 10:00 and we have a short day to the next shelter where we will stop for the day. It looks like the worst of the weather should be out by around 11:00 so I expect that even if it is raining it will be short lived.","Caribou Valley Road
",Stratton,"Sep 04, Tue",8.30
Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/392277,"This morning we woke to the sound of driving rain. It started raining after midnight - and we were glad to be inside Vs out in our tents on the trail. Hikers had been streaming into Stratton late in the day on Tuesday night to get inside before the weather had hit so town was busy last night with the influx of hikers off of the trail.I looked at the RADAR on my phone and checked the National Weather Service and other resources I use when check the forecast, and announced to Greenie that the rain would be done by 9:00 AM. Greenie quipped at me with skepticism, but I stood by my analysis and reconfirmed that the rain would end by 9:00.Susan had given us the keys to a Jeep she had for hikers to use when in town, so we invited the hikers in the ""bunk house"" to join us for breakfast but there was only one taker.We went down to the Looney Moose for breakfast, which was something (eating breakfast out) we had been looking forward to enjoying while in town. While enjoying breakfast we found out that about three inches of rain had fallen overnight - so the rivers (water levels) were now a concern.We were back at the motel by 8:30 and sure enough, by 9:00 it stopped raining. Greenie congratulated me on my prediction - but still with some doubt in his voice that it would in fact stay that way.Susan drove us over to Caribou Valley Road and when she got out of the car to see us off, she remarked that she had serious doubts on our ability to cross the Carabassett river given how loud it was at the distance we were at from the river. She said she would wait for us to let her know if we could cross or not before taking off. When we got to the river it was a roiling torrent - and there was no way in hell we would be able to cross.We went back to Susan who was still waiting at the car with a look of ""I told you so"" on her face. We opted instead to head over to the base of the Sugarloaf Mountain ski area and hike up to the summit via the ski trails and then take the blue blaze side trail to the AT. This would allow us to keep on schedule and only skip a 2.2 mile section of the trail. The bottom line is that this was the safe way to proceed and keep on schedule.It was sometime after 10:30 by the time we were hiking, and the climb up the ski slopes was no easy task. The runs are designed to go down....not up. We reached a warming house and thought we were at the top - but when we did not find the side trail and after checking one of the trail maps on the slope we realized we were only half way to the top.We picked up the tote road leading to the summit and followed that the rest of the way. The wind was ripping and the clouds were blowing across the face of the mountain as we made our way up. Hypothermia was a real concern given the conditions, and we were pleased and fortunate to find that the warming hut was ""open"" at the summit in which to take refuge. The hut was really trashed with the door missing from the east side - but we entered to get out of the weather, dry out and eat lunch.After eating we followed the cairns that lead to the blue blazed side trail. Some workers were just over the ridge line taking down an old tower and we stopped to talk to them for a minute before heading down to the AT. Once we dropped into the trees, the wind died down and the chill factor became a non-issue. The trails however were now running streams. We had one more river crossing between here and Rangeley at the Orbeton river to be concerned with, but we hoped that the levels would come down by the time we got there. ""At least water will not be an issue"" I commented to Greenie as we discussed what was ahead of us and the possiblity we could have to wait an extra day for the water levels to drop. We had food for three days but could stretch to four if we needed to do so.Once we hit the AT, we turned south bound heading for the next shelter. Greenie commented that ""we are home again"" seeing comfort in the white blazes marking the trail.As we intercepted north bound hikers we provided them with the status of the river ahead of them and suggested that the take the side route as we had - but that the decision was theirs to make with the information they hadWe reached the Spaulding Mountain shelter by about 3:00 where we were eventually joined for the night by two NOBO hikers ""Pain"" and ""Warrior"". Honest Abe was a the shelter when we got there - but only to take a break before continuing on. He planned to stealth camp at the summit warming hut since he knew it was open.Today was an adventure- but we had made the right decisions for us and our safety. As night fell we climbed into our sleeping bags and bedded down for the night.","Stratton

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/392278,"We were up around our usual time of 6:00 this morning but took a little longer getting up and out of camp. For some reason we seem more efficient in getting out of camp when we tent Vs when we stay in a shelter. I guess it is that we are so much more ""compartmentalized"" when in a tent where we tend to spread out in a shelter.We said our goodbyes to Pain and Warrior and continued south bound. We passed some hikers along the way who had crossed the Orbeton River that morning and from the sound of it, the water level should not be over our knees - good news after hearing yesterday that the level was over the top of other hikers legs.A couple of passing NOBO hikers told us of some bear tracks on the trail ahead - so we stopped to take some pictures of them. Seeing the tracks made me feel all the better about our practice of doing proper bear bag lines to hang our food at night while others take the chance of hanging food in the shelters. We followed Sluice brook for a while - and after seeing the way the water channels down a rock sluiceway I can see where it gets its name from. The brook ends in a beautiful waterfall just before reaching the Orbeton River and we found some really great swim spots which we would have endulged ourselves in had it been warmer.We changed into our crocs to get across the Orbeton River and found the crossing a non-issue. Greenie had never forded a stream before, so this was a first for him.The hike up Poplar Ridge seemed to go on and on with multiple false summits - which started to frustrate me to no end. By the time we hit the peak I was one big sweat ball and smelled like you read about.We stopped for lunch of the rock summit and spread our gear out to dry out from the sweat and wet conditions the day before.After lunch as we started down to the Poplar Ridge shelter I slipped and fell - bouncing not once but twice after landing on my pack Vs my rear end before coming to rest in the dirt. Greenie gave me a hand up and we got moving again.We stopped at the shelter for water and continued on. This is one shelter I am glad we did not stay at as the sleeping platform was made of branches that had been stripped of their bark and layed side by side creating a washboard effect. NOT my idea of something comfortable to sleep on - but then again, any port in a storm will do.We made the climb up over Saddleback Junior and then up to the Reddington Stream Camp site where we would spend our last night on the trail. The camp site is new and hardly used - it seems from a spacing perspective that the thru-hikers skip this spot and they usually tend to put into shelters Vs camp sites.We had a tent platform to ourselves and in fact, only two other hikers stayed at the camp site that night tenting below where we set camp so it felt like we had the entire place to ourselves.Greenie and I spent some time discussing how all of our decisions had paid off on this trip and how we had avoided not only some crazy rain from the remnants of the hurricane as well as worked around what was clearly a dangerous river crossing. This trip had certainly become a real adventure!We bedded down before dark with nothing left to do for the day - glad things had worked as well as it had, but beginning to feel sad that our week on the trail was almost over. We still had some great hiking ahead of us tomorrow with Saddleback and the Horn still to get over and a long stretch of alpine zone to take in....now all we needed was for the weather to cooperate one more day.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

We finally bagged trying to sleep and got up at about 5:45 AM. We broke camp before eating breakfast as we always do and as we were taking down our tents I looked up and saw that the moon was big as day right over our heads - a beautiful sight. We hit the trail by 7:20, saying goodbye to the two hikers that came in late in the day the night before as we passed their tenting spot.The climb up the horn was about 750 vertical feet, and we reached the summit at about 8:15. The peak was covered in clouds and the wind was blowing fairly hard. As we made our way toward Saddleback the clouds started to break up and we started to catch views of what lay ahead - miles of alpine zone hiking!As we passed through the col between Saddleback and the Horn, we met two thru-hikers heading north that had spent the night on the porch of a warming cabin at the summit of the ski area. They were reveling in their good fortune as not only did they have a prime camping spot, they had electricity with which to charge their phones.As the day progressed, the views got better and better and Greenie and I were at a loss for words to describe what we saw. I have been in the alpine zone before and have logged many miles above tree line - and still to this day find those places magical - but this topped all that I had seen before. The stretch of uninterrupted beauty went on for miles. This land is truly a special place to be protected and preserved.We stopped at the summit of Saddleback to take a break, dry off from our sweat and enjoy the view. The clouds being ushered over the mountain just north of us was like a flowing stream as the wind propelled the white mass from the depth of the valleys below up and over the col between Saddleback and the Horn.We finally had to be on our way, and left the summit with reluctance yet extreme satisfaction. As we made our way toward the Piazza Rock lean-to, we discussed the possibility of extending our hike two days to complete the section between Caratunk and Monson. I started off the discussion by saying to Greenie that this trip had been so fantastic, that I thought that we should end the hike with today Vs taking the chance of jinxing things by extending our hike. The trip had been so perfect that anything else would be anticlimactic. I had made the mistake at one time of going for miles Vs going for the smiles - I did not want to go down that path again.So we decided to end our hike today at Rangeley and go home on Saturday. In the end, we awoke on Saturday to rain and bad weather so we know we made the right decision.We stopped at Piazza Rock lean-to for lunch and then pressed on to Greenie's car at the parking area at the AT in Rangeley.As we made our way back up to Caratunk to spend the night and retrieve my car, we spoke with extreme satisfaction about our trip and how we had made all of the right decisions for us on this hike - and all had turned out well.","Reddington Stream Camping area

I will overnight at Hiker Hostel along the way to keep my load light by not carrying extra food, spending only one night tenting on the trail. My friends husband will pick me up near the summit of Springer Vs my having to do the approach trail given the time constraints I will be operating under.With the hike later this week, and the other hikes I have planned, barring any physical issues I will easily clear the 1,000 mile mark this year - making the idea that I will finish the trail (2014?) more and more of a possibility.

My gear was already there where I had shipped it down to the outfitter last week. I settled into the Hostel which felt like a cross between a submarine and a dungeon in terms of aesthetics - but at least it was warm and dry. In all there were 16 of us in the bunk room.A local church group brought in a (free) fantastic dinner for the hikers of Spaghetti with meat sauce, bread, salad, sweet tea and brownies - YUM :>).Among the hikers staying at the hostel were a couple of guys from Germany here to hike for about 30 days and a number of thru-hikers, mostly in their early 20's. One hiker was from Pelham, Massachusetts. I was up at 6:00 this morning - Pirate (the keeper of the hostel) as already up and making breakfast. The coffee was already made!Being toward the western side of the time zone it did not get light until 7:30 - which was when I left the hostel heading south. It was raining lightly as I headed up the trail. I made the summit of Blood Mountain in an hour and 20 minutes. Stopping at the shelter at the summit for a few minutes, I headed on south.It was raining and cold, but as I descended to lower elevations it gradually warmed. The rain slowed and eventually stopped altogether.Along the way I met a young NOBO hiker from Vermont. She greeted me with ""hello Yankee"" when she found out I was from the Boston area. We spoke for a while and then walked on.I ran into Mother goose, who was hiking with an older couple. After they were out of ear shot, she asked me about the summit conditions on Blood Mountain - and then she said that they were ""newbies"" and that she would bypass the summit to avoid the tough footing and weather conditions.I pulled into Woody Gap at about 12:30 and caught a ride from two men that had just finished resupplying a friend heading north. They drove me to the Hiker Hostel which is where I am now. This place is a beautiful log cabin structure with all the comforts of home.I need to check the weather for tomorrow and figure out my game plan as the word I heard on the trail from other hikers was heavy rain and possible thunderstorms in the morning followed by clearing and much colder weather. My goal is to reach Hawk Mountain shelter - 13 miles and about 2600 feet of elevation change.In all it has been a beautiful day on the trail. The trail in Georgia today was without the rocks and roots like we have up north, so the hiking was easy going and fast paced. I could not see much due to fog at elevation - but the sun did try to make an appearance more than once and the fog lifted at the lower elevations. Not a bad first day covering 10.6M and 4,600 feet in elevation change.","Neels Gap

For the most part, the rain cleared out by about 8:00 and I was not dropped off to the trail head until 9:00.There was a fog that hung in the trees as I made my way southbound. I passed several NOBO hikers as I worked my way south. Passing through Gooch Gap there were a number of hikers still breaking camp which I surmised to be a church group or something given their numbers. I stopped at Gooch Mountain shelter at about 11:30 where I took an early lunch and drew water at the spring. Razor, a ridge runner came into the shelter as I was preparing to leave. We had a nice conversation about LNT and the ""newbies"" on the trail.Not far after Justus Creek I ran into ""Don's Brother"". We stopped to talk for a few minutes and he told me about the passing of his brother who had recently succumb to ALS. Don's Brother is on the trail walking in memory of his brother and trying to raise money for ALS research.I passed through Coopers Gap and Horse Gap and by the time I reached Hightower Gap my legs were starting to tell me ""enough"". I had hoped to be into camp at Hawk Mountain by 3:30 or so, but I was not in camp with my tent set up until 4:30. In looking back I had under calculated the elevation change on the day not counting for Sassafrass and a couple other peaks en-route (stupid on my part). I would have set camp along the trail if I had not needed water (there is none after Justus Creek until the shelter).It was raining when I put into camp. After filtering water and other things I set about getting dinner together at the shelter. There was some dude there with a strange camera contraption that takes 360 degree pictures every so many seconds...which looked heavy and on top of it crapped out in the bad weather.After dinner I went back to my tent to settle in for the night and found that the tent was LEAKING! I guess my old Hubba finally failed me after the many nights on the trail and I had to rig the piece of Tyvek I carry over the tent to keep the rain out (and had to cut my new bear bag cordage in the process).Overnight, it was blowing like crazy and the temperatures dropped from in the 40's into the 20's with snow.I am glad I have all of the full-on winter condition hiking experience I gained this year as it all came into play on this hike. There is something to be said about climbing 4,000 footers in winter conditions that gives you an education you will get nowhere else!","Woody Gap

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/404617,"It was blowing and snowing like crazy when I finally got on the trail at 9:00 AM. The sun rising so late here (7:30ish) with being so far west in the time zone still puts me off balance. I was awake at 5:30 but did not feel like moving until light.I spoke to the other hikers at the shelter about how to keep their water from freezing and drinkable given that none had winter hiking experience. It seemed to be getting colder by the minute so I hustled onto the trail to keep warm. The snow was blowing almost sideways where the wind boomeranged through the mountains.The trail was easy and the elevation change mild as I largely descended for the first few miles. The trail started a steady incline at about three forks as I passed through some beautiful rhododendron forests and walked past long creek falls. The Benton MacKaye trail crossed the AT in several places. I met several hikers along the way and stopped to talk. I had anticipated I would see Guru and Dyer Straights, and before too long ran into them heading north. It always amazes me how you can meet someone on the trail and feel like you found your long lost brother when you see them again down the trail. I hope to see them again up north later this year.I also met Fahmah who I expected to find based on his journal. We stopped and spoke for a few minutes.I will say that I found it distressing seeing so many people hiking north wearing blue jeans or inappropriate footwear for winter conditions - but I did - and it makes me wonder if one of these folks is going to get themselves into trouble with hypothermia, frostbite or worse. VERY Scary.When I reached the USFS 42 at 12:15, I had intended to hike on to the summit of Springer - but I was behind schedule with 45 minutes until my ride would arrive, my legs were spent and the conditions were horrible (40 to 45 MPH winds/25 or so degrees and snow). I opted to call it and wait. Springer will still be there when I climb it with Greenie, so I felt it better to save it for that moment rather than push on.I can see from this walk why so many people drop out by Neels Gap given the big swings in weather and the rolling terrain. While the tread ways are smooth and wide I could see the look in many hikers eyes saying ""what the hell am I doing"" or worse. Moreover many do not appear to be mentally prepared for how hard the trail can be","Hawk Mountain Shelter

I could hear them breaking camp and never did get to see them again to say goodbye one more time. Greenie was going to give Darth and Dog a lift to the bus station to head home - but we never saw them again so we had to assume that where they got out so early they must have caught a ride on their own.We hit the trail at 7:00 straight up, and passed Rooser and a couple of NOBO girls on the way out of the shelter. We expected it would take us three hours to hike into Port Clinton, but my feet were really sore with a couple of hot spots on the bottom of my left foot and the heat and humidity was off the chart so we kept the pace slower than usual. The rocks were a bit more prevalent this morning which also slowed us down.We stopped at a vista to try to dry off and take a break but with the humidity there was no getting my socks to dry at all so I just had to push through it.The final climb down into Port Clinton is a really steep one - not a place that you want to slide or fall as you would keep sliding and pick up a great ""rash"" from the stones and gravel on trail.We pulled into Port Clinton at 11:00 and drove in Greenies car back to the 501 shelter where my car was parked.

In the morning we will retrace our steps back to Crawford Notch where we will cross US 302 and head up Webster Cliffs and eventually to Mizpah Hut.On this hike I am leading an AMC backpack as an extension of our chapter's backpacking series - and for some on the trip this will be the first White Mountain backpack and also their first 4,000 footer to boot.The hike in took much longer than I expected as many of the group have not done a backpack with the roots and rocks of the Whites.

We would have been out of camp earlier if not for one of the crew having gastric distress which required an extended use of the privy.We made US 302 in about two hours(more respectable for a group this size) and after dumping extra gear (tents, stoves etc) at the cars, we made our way north with lightened loads. As we walked down to 302 we feasted on wild raspberries growing along the roadway.The climb up Webster Cliffs started all nice and gradual, but turned tough the further up we went. I expected some good rock scrambles and the AT obliged with some stiff climbs that tested some members of the crew.I have to say how proud I was of the group (four ladies and three guys) as there were plenty of places where we could have had some serious meltdowns but it never happened.We made the summit of Mt Webster after lunch and then turned north toward Mt Jackson. The trail turned much more kinder and gentler with some minor steep parts but overall the trail gave way to a more reasonable pace.Before passing over some bog bridges we passed a woman drawing, stopped to say hello and kept walking.We reached the hut by 5:15, about an hour or so later than I had expected for a group like this.

As always it will take some hard work and mental resolve but if I can come back from a broken ankle, lacerated cornea, broken big toe, Achilles tendon and heel problems...and oh yeah...cardiomyopathy (congestive heart)...I can beat this too. It is all in your attitude and will. Like the trail, the mental is by far more important than the physical. You can always push through the physical - but the mental can be a showstopper for many.Greenie has decided that he will wait for me to heal and will wait to finish this section with me when I am up and running. We have also asked for 12 weeks off next year to finish the trail so that is going to be my focus - providing I can get it off from work.

When I do it up, I do it really nice - nothing half baked for this trail stomper!Next step is to see a specialist - but I do not expect that there will be a surgical procedure done and that it will be simply left to heal. I am looking at six or more weeks before resuming any physical (hiking and the like) activity so getting something in during the October period is out.Ultimately I will be able to resume my normal activities and be out there backpacking again next year - and perhaps backpacking and snow shoeing will be in the mix this winter to keep me from getting cabin fever.I am going to owe my wife ""Puddles"" in epic proportions after this is all said and done.The bright spot (if there is to be one) is that the weather was really raunchy this past weekend and they got about 2"" of rain in the Caratunk and Monson areas on Monday so at least I missed out on that ""fun"".I am still waiting to hear what work will or will not let me do in terms of taking an extended period of time off in 2014 (to finish the trail) and will probably not hear for another few weeks.","

The only choice for someone like myself who is active and athletic is to fix it. I have another 1,200 miles still to walk and I am going to finish the trail if I have to crawl the rest of that distance.At least the results of this surgery are, by in large, very successful.

The surgery according to the doctor was textbook and I should see a full recovery within four to six months.As of last week I started putting about 50% weight on the injured leg while using crutches (standing only, not walking) and I can do some isometric exercises to ""awaken"" my quad muscles - but NOTHING yet with the hamstring.I have had to wear a brace 24 hours a day to restrict the movement of my leg and am now up to 60 degrees of movement at the hip so sitting down is getting easier but still not tolerable for more than a few hours tops. The location and size of the incision is still a major factor to sitting with any comfort.In just over a week I should be able to lose the brace and begin walking on the leg - which I am sure will be a charm given I have not used it in six weeks.Greenie and I have been discussing next year and will make a determination of how much of the AT we will work on once the dust settles a little and I have a better read on my recovery and how much time I can get off from work. Our original plan was to finish the trail, and while we still would like to do that it may not be feasible. We will at a minimum take a good bite out of Virginia and finish back up to Caledonia in PA where we left off on the southern end last year. Time will tell what kind of distance I can put down and the pace I will be able to keep - at least initially. 100 mile weeks are likely out of reach until I get myself fully healed and conditioned.More to come as things proceed.","Home

Everyday is focusing on the here and now and recognizing the baby steps that will eventually get me to 100%.I can do the following which given where I was just a few weeks ago is a big deal:1) I can now put on my own socks and shoes and tie my own laces.2) If I drop the soap in the shower I no longer have to call for my wife to pick it up - I can actually bend down and get it myself.3) I have 105 degrees of movement at my hip now - which means I can almost reach my toes to trim my own nails.4) I and sit on a regular toilet vs. having to use an elevated potty chairI think you get the idea. Independence in terms of the things we all take for granted until they are gone is a big deal - and the little victories all add up to one big win.I have initiated discussions with work about time off in 2014 in hopes of getting a hike in that is more than ten days or two weeks - but I am not completely confident that I will get what I am looking for (three months).

Slow by my standards, but I did it. The funny thing is, I looked at the small changes in elevation today with some apprehension, not wanting to do more than I should. I never looked at going up this way in the past....I always loved going up. It was down that slowed me and gave me caution.I miss the woods, and in one instant as I watched a wind devil swirl across the now harvested corn field and melt into a stand of trees it hit me - how much I miss the woods.I wrote on my calendar at home, numbering each week from the day of my surgery as a mile marker for the time that has passed and the time that I yet have to wait. There are no guarantees that I will be up and hiking the way I did prior to the accident after six months. In fact, while the prognosis is highly favorable, there is no guarantee that I will return to the form I had prior to my injury. All I can do is work at it, watch the weeks move by and be positive.I also started a note book within which to record my daily PT and other physical activities as I work toward returning to long distance hiking and backpacking. Greenie writes every day when we are on the trail - and I think I too will continue this practice after I am better.My hope of finishing the trail in 2014 when I am still 55 is probably not going to happen - but I will adjust as needed. I have set the lofty goal (given my current status) of doing about 260 miles of the AT this year. If my body is willing and heals properly I know I can do it. So it is in my mind more a question of when, not if.","Home

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440514,"So today marks a milestone in my recovery from hamstring repair surgery. I am beginning week 17 post operation this Friday and will likely end my PT next week. The focus now is on gaining strength in my injured leg and resuming normal activities. I am up to 11+ miles on the stationary bike and the big news is that today I did 3.3 miles hiking at a 3 mph pace which is a huge step forward for me as it is the longest distance I have walked since tearing my hamstring tendons. I still have a long way to go to my old pace of 4 mph and 18 mile days, but the confidence I am gaining and the strength I am feeling in the injured leg is highly encouraging. I started a trip flow plan yesterday during my lunch hour at work as I prepare to do 220 miles in May with my hiking buddy Greenie. I have been guardedly optimistic on hiking in 2014, but steps like today make me feel that it is a realistic goal to strive toward. I guess all I can say is to keep the faith and keep working at my PT and conditioning. The ordeal has been a test of my faith, mental strength, courage and commitment to hiking the AT. I can say with a clear conscience that I have remained strong and steadfast on all fronts.Happy new year to all!","home

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440985,"Each week I continue to show improvement in my hamstring repair recovery. Today the weather was perfect for hiking, and I got out on the local trails. Much of the snow and ice had melted off with the warmer temps and rain yesterday and today was up in the 40s with a good wind, but perfect hiking weather. I had to use my micro spikes in only one short shaded section, otherwise the trail was largely clear of ice and snow.I stretched my hiking distance to 4.4 miles today at a 3.4 MPH pace. This is on top of doing a 14 mile bike ride on the stationary bike yesterday. The strength in my leg has greatly improved and I am testing the hamstring strength with some climbs and a faster pace which is showing promise of coming back to my old form.I took the steep side of Cedar hill from the north, a drumlin that straddles the Northborough and Westborough line. I did shorten my stride, but I kept a respectable pace and topped the summit with little difficulty.My leg did tire as I came within about a half mile of the finish point, but never had any pain or discomfort.All of this is giving me more confidence in my capabilities and encouragement in my physical therapy training regimen at home.I complete week 18 post-op this Thursday and with eight weeks to a full six months post-op, I am still feeling I will be in good shape by the middle of March. Not leaving until early may gives me that additional buffer to finish my rehab and I am planning on doing one low level backpack toward the end of April to give myself one final test before taking on a three week walk. The original plan to finish the AT this year with my injury last August is just not going to happen. I will have to be happy with a shorter walk and focus on 2015 to finish.All is good and I am much encouraged!","Home

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/445584,"So today I received my final discharge from Nancy my physical therapist and last week I received the same (with no restrictions) from Dr. Price my Orthopedic surgeon. It has been a long hard road since last August when my ability to walk and hike came to a screeching halt due to tearing (as in detached) my right hamstring tendons. I have gone from not even being able to use my right leg six months ago to hiking 13 miles last weekend over typical New England rolling terrain. My pace has come down a bit (3.7 MPH vs 4+ MPH), but that will come back with time. Greenie commented that some of my hiking friends will be ""happy"" I have slowed down a bit!I have to thank both Nancy S. at South County PT and Dr. Price at UMass Medical center as for without their skills and help I would not be walking now, never mind hiking. You both now will forever be a part of my AT story and adventure. I cannot thank you both enough. The thought of what you both have done for me brings tears to my eyes as I write this. They are, after all, tears of happiness.So, while I still have work to do to get ready for doing the AT and the LT this year my plans are in place and are firming up. Greenie and I cut down our planned time on the AT to just under two weeks and about 140 miles from the northern end of SNP in VA up to Caledonia State park in PA this May and thirty miles in September between Caratunk and Monson in September.Greenie, Hot Wire and I will also finish the final northern 50 miles of the Long trail up to Journeys End in early July. We would not have been able to complete the AT this year, but at least we will finish the Long Trail!I also want to thank Haystack for providing me with highly valuable information on his hike through SNP and north. Guidebooks are great as are maps, but first hand knowledge and experience is even better. Thanks Haystack! I know we will see each other again both on and off of the trail. Don't forget the Gathering in the fall.There will be more to come as I get closer to May and hitting the trail. This year will be the most special of them all and I cannot wait to get out there. The old adage that you don't know what you have until you don't have it any longer could never be more true. Walking is something we all take for granted. I am eternally grateful for having my ability to do so back!","Home

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/452510,"I set foot on the AT this past weekend for the first time since last May. I have been working hard at my recovery and preparing for a 140 mile section hike I will start in a few weeks. This was the third year I have been an instructor for the AMC Worcester Chapter's backpacking program, and the hike this past weekend was the first overnight trail experience for a number of folks that participated in the workshop.For me it was the first steps I had taken on the AT since my hamstring repair last September - and I felt like Neil Armstrong stepping on the moon!The section is one of my all time favorites in Massachusetts, and the Tom Leonard Shelter is by far my favorite in the entire state.As we turned southbound off of the blue blazed trail out of Beartown State Forest, the magnitude of these first steps hit me hard. My eyes filled with tears and I had to choke back my emotions. This trip was my ""reality check"" to see how my leg handled carrying a full pack for a couple of days. It was a short walk of only around 5.2 miles each way, but it was another big step forward in regaining my mental strength that I could hit the trail and not have issues.We had a mixed bag of weather - from rain to sun to cold to sleet - it was all good. The trip out took much longer than I would have like to seen it take, but given that I had several folks that were new to backpacking the slow pace was to be expected.We put into camp mid-afternoon and the sun was out in its full glory. It was strange pitching my tent as I had not put it up in almost a year. I love this tent, and in a mixed bag of weather it performed beautifully - Thanks Judy for making me such a great tent!I will have another two weeks of training and then will taper my activity level in preparation for my walk beginning on the 18th of May. There is much to do yet, but I am so looking forward to placing my feet on trail that I have yet to walk...and officially in the south to boot!","In the Berkshires

We slackpacked the first 8.6 miles to get our legs up and running where we had spent about 10 hours on Saturday driving down south.We met Puddles and Chris for lunch at the Elkwallow Gap wayside. They were to meet us by noon with lunch and our gear - but they were waiting for us at the picnic area vs. the wayside where we were waiting. We did finally connect when I wandered over to the picnic area and oddly enough Chris ventured out in the car to see if we were at the Wayside.Hanging out at the wayside we met Flossy and Gray Squirrel along with Reset and three brothers from Texas. Greenie and I packed our gear after lunch and headed off to the shelter while Chris and Puddles headed back north.We put into the hut at about 3:00 or so, set our tents up and went about our camp chores and dinner preparation. After eating we wandered over to the shelter only to find we had just missed seeing a bear that had come into camp.We hit the hay before dark, thus ending a good first day on the trail.","Thorton Gap in Shenadoah

We saw many wild flowers and a variety of birds including bluebirds and a Scarlet Tanager. The trail in Shenandoah is beautiful and well maintained, but today I managed to hit my right big toe straight on about 12 or 15 times and created a blister under the nail and the nail bed. On top of it, I started having a blister under my right foot behind the toes and my left knee was acting up to boot. The good news in my hamstring is now the least of my worries...which by the way has not been an issue at all.As we approached Front Royal, there was a high chain link fence that started deep in the woods and ran all the way to the highway. Greenie and I thought it was more like Jurassic Park than anything else as it was kind of creepy.At one point I hit my toe (the bad one) and let out a series of bad words - to which I heard a thunderous noise in the woods like a tree falling. Greenie said it was the biggest vulture he had ever seen that took flight just as I cursed. I guess I better watch my words out here just in case the big man is listening!We put into the Mosby tent site which turned out to be a beautiful site - with flat ground, benches and a pristine spring nearby...and we had the entire site to ourselves to boot.Just to end what was a tough day of dealing with foot and knee issues, as I was getting into my tent the zipper on my vestibule broke!

The cabin - and privy (who pad locks a privy??) were both locked up tight as a drum, but we had the porch all to ourselves and aside from the cold drinks and ice cream Greenie was craving (that were not there) we could not ask for more.My foot has been problematic all day and I have had to drain the fluid building under the nail (ugh!). My left knee has been sore most of the day with the IT band acting up and tightness even on the uphill climbs. I have been changing my socks often to keep my feet dry to keep the blister under control and taking vitamin ""I"" to keep my knee reasonably comfortable.  Along the way today we passed through a section called the ""Trillium Trail"", a bird watchers paradise. We saw a form of a towhee which I had not seen before and literally fields of Trillium that seemed to go on for ever. There were wildflowers abundant today - more than I can name or identify but they were prolific and beautiful. We bedded down for the night in comfort and exhaustion from a day that turned out to be much longer than either of us had expected. 49 miles in three days - much more than I had planned but at least we have only about 12 miles to do tomorrow (and the ""roller coaster"") into Bears Den.","Mosby primitive tent site

Shortly there after we entered the ""roller coaster"" - a series of about 7 mountains in about as many miles....or so it seemed. The first two climbs were fairly big and as the day wore on, the ups and downs took a toll on me. My legs had not much get-up and go, but we pressed on.Today was also MUCH more humid than any day so far on this trip and there is a chance of thunderstorms and hail tonight, so we are glad we will be staying in the hostel. I was so sweated up when we arrived at the hostel I did not have a dry spot on anything on my body.Greenie and I saw another Scarlet Tanager today while eating lunch at the Sam Moore shelter. We meet a group of three section hikers that ended up at Bears Den tonight too. Flossie and Gray Squirrel are also here as are the three brothers we met on our first day.The hikers special is $30 which includes a bunk, shower, laundry, pizza, soda and a pint of Ben and Jerry's to boot.Tomorrow we will get dropped off about 14 miles north and hike back to the hostel so we can slack-pack and give my knee a break by only carrying what we need for the day. The change of plans will only give us about 6 miles into Harpers Ferry on Friday so we will end up with almost two days off - a much needed break for me.All is good - clean clothes, a real bed, a shower and a stomach full of pizza - oh for the simple things in life!","Myron Glaser Cabin

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/457321,"Greenie and I opted to slackpack back to Bears Den today to take it easy on my knee and give us only about six miles into Harpers Ferry on Friday.We caught a ride from the Hostel and was on the trail heading southbound at about 8:15 AM this morning. The trail was nice and easy with a smooth treadway and only gradual elevation change. We passed several of the other hikers we had spent the last few days with as we made our way south.There were all sorts of flower today, some of which I have never seen before. When I get home I will be able to upload the photos and add them to my journal.We stopped at a beautiful vista for a break overlooking sprawling farmlands below in the valley. For the most part, the day was cool and breezy, but as we neared 10:00 we could feel the heat building and in spots we were below the ridge line and were out of the breeze so the temps were oppressive at times.We stopped at a spring at lunch and sat with our feet dangling in the cold flow of the stream coming out of the ground. Truly a beautiful spot.But the news of the day was after lunch - my knee flared up so badly I could hardly walk a step without pain, and at times I was lucky if I was going even one mile per hour. It became clear that today would be my last day on the trail this trip and at Snickers gap, I could go no further. Greenie hiked the last quarter mile to get a ride back to the trail head to give me a ride back to the hostel.So our plans now are to head over to Harpers Ferry tomorrow via a ride from the Bears Den folks, meet my Sister and Mom who were going to meet us in Harpers anyhow and catch a ride back up north to my car and head home on Saturday. I will have to get my knee checked out when I get home, but my guess is that it is plain and simple overuse in a short period of time. I will want to be sure that nothing mechanical is wrong with it just in case.We did 75.3 miles in five days, nothing to sneeze at, but next time out we will start off with much shorter miles to break into the trail and gain our trail legs.","Keys Gap, WV

The pain I had on the trail has subsided as expected with some rest, but it is still stiff and has some finger point tenderness.I have an MRI scheduled for tomorrow so I will find out if I did anything structurally to it....hopefully not. One surgery in a twelve month period is enough for anyone and I already owe my wife in epic proportions from the last one.Ahead we still have plans to finish the Long trail and our last 50 miles of the northern end of the trail - so I will need to get myself back into hiking condition after I get the results from the MRI assuming it is all clear.All I can think of was a quote from AWOL's book about those hikers that were too aggressive out of the box at Springer - I think he said ""too fast, too soon, too far"" - and now I know what he meant. I think in my enthusiasm to get back on the trail this year I forgot to temper my expectations (and miles) and work back into the trail after my surgery. 75 miles in five days is a 105 mile week pace and that is too damn fast.

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/459351,"So I got the MRI results over the weekend and in all it is not bad news. First of all there is no evidence of meniscus or ligament damage - which was my biggest fear. A structural injury would be devastating at this point in time.I do have tendinitis where the Quad attaches at the knee and IT band syndrome (which I have had in the past). There is evidence of swelling in and around the area of discomfort. Bottom line is I have to do more stretching, further strengthen my quad and rest/ice the knee along with a regimen of anti-inflammatory drugs to address the swelling. Clearly I did too much, too soon, too fast - and I will need to take it slow as I rehab to allow for proper healing so I don't end up in a repetitive cycle of improving and then re-injuring it by pushing it. Cross training should help to avoid repetitive motion injury.So I will rehab this as best I can keeping in mind that I plan to finish the LT (50 miles) in just over five weeks from now.

On our way north we met a couple named Gun Powder and Flint who are finishing their flip-flop thru hike which they will finish at the Virginia line. Just before meeting Gun Powder and Flint we came to an unusual large round pit that was reinforced with stone around the exterior perimeter. We surmised it to be some form of a fortification from the Civil War.We passed Penn-Mar park and the Mason-Dixon line where we signed the trail register and took some pictures. We had a stiff climb up toward PA 16 which was the only really challenging climb of the day. At noon, we were not hungry so we opted to push on past a nice spring and tenting spot along the trail to Deer Lick shelters for lunch.After lunch as we were hiking down a slope, we heard some dogs barking off in the woods. I thought there was a house in the direction of the barking. ..but all of a sudden a ""herd"" of 12 small dogs the size of beagles came woofing down the slope to greet us. It was the funniest sight I have ever seen on the trail.

Small biting flies swarmed us so we kept our stop brief.We reached the Ed Gravely Shelter just after noon, hitting our ""10 (miles) by 12:00"".

Today as we came to find out was opening day for deer using primitive firearms. I was glad we had our ""don't shoot me"" colors on our packs!We stopped at the restroom at the Washington Monument camping area to use the facilities and get some water, then hiked onto the Washington Monument park. We stopped to climb the tower even though there were not any views today.After crossing Boonsboro Mountain Road we scared some folks there foraging for what looked to be mushrooms.

The bridge looked ghostly with the fog at the opposite end. We bypassed the side trail to Pine Knob Shelter and headed to Annapolis Rocks for lunch.When we arrived at Annapolis Rocks the view was socked in by clouds. There was a college group there learning to repel and belay. I went to the spring to get some water after we had eaten, and came back to clearing skies which allowed some really nice views. We had planned to possibly camp here but given the early hour we moved on.We got to Pogo Memorial camp site and stopped to evaluate where we were at that time of day. We were thinking of moving on, but after SOBO hiker ""Saw Bone"" came along and told us that water was flowing at the next shelter, we opted to keep going. We spoke briefly with Saw Bone and his friend hiking with him for a couple of days, said goodbye and moved on north. We passed a Ridge Runner shortly after who did not know that primitive firearms season had started.We stopped at Black Rock Cliffs to take in the views and moved on. We met three SOBO ladies, told them that Saw Bone was just ahead and heading for Annapolis Rocks for lunch and moved on.We got into some good rocks along the ridge after that which reminded us of Pennsylvania rocks. We stopped to take in the one east facing vistas and kept moving.Just before the descent from the ridge line the trail swung back hard to the right and started climbing the rocks on the east side of the mountain that had kept us company for a bit of the afternoon hike. I got concerned that I had misjudged where we were and had much further to go than I thought. I was relieved that we started dropping down via a series of switch backs to MD 17. We crossed over the road, crossed a stream and found ourselves at the shelter in short order.There were a couple of local guys at the shelter, obviously sleeping off beer they had consumed. Greenie and I opted to tent above the shelter vs deal with the locals and their friends that were supposedly to arrive later on.We set camp, drew water and other chores prior to doing our traditional ""happy hour"" and dinner.We bedded down at 7:30 where it was dark and there was nothing else to be done.Tomorrow we only have 3.9 miles left to Raven Rock Road - so I texted my wife (no cell signal to make calls but had data service) and asked her to let Dave at Burgundy Lane know we would hit the road at about 9:00 the following morning.It was nice to be out camping on the trail for the first time this trip. The weather had forced us to make changes so we could be sure to finish this section this trip vs stranding a short section to have to come back and finish. In all this has been a good trip and a beautiful section to walk.","Reno Monument Road

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476731,"I woke up at about 1:00 in the morning and could not believe that it was only that hour of the night. I slept fairly well, but a large tree that fell nearby made me nervous that a tree might do the same closer to where we camped. The rain this week caused a number of dead trees to drop along the trail, including the one we saw come down as we approached Harpers Ferry from the south.At 5:30 AM I could hear Greenie stirring, and new that we would be up and moving before it was light. At 6:30 I started packing my gear inside my tent.We were up, fed and out before 8:00. There were a couple of section hikers that were at the shelter that I spoke to briefly before we left. Apparently the locals had packed up and gone home after dark, which explains why it got so quiet after we bedded down. The two section hikers were on their very first section hike and commented on the ups and downs north of us. I know that given more miles under their feet they will view terrain like that as rolling and easy.We passed under some power lines and then into some large and recently hayed fields. One of the fields had been mowed and tufted but not bailed yet.We passed a man and a woman doing a section hike who we stopped and spoke to briefly and then moved on.We crossed two streams and just as we walked up to Raven Rock Road, David was just pulling up. Our timing could not have been any better!So with this trip we now can cross off Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. We will be hiking in the south from here on until we finish the lower part of the trail and then jump back up to Maine to finish the trail. We are not certain what our plans are for 2015, but we do know that we want to get on the trail SOBO and just walk until we decide to stop vs have to be somewhere by a certain date.","Ensign Cowell Shelter

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480766,"So Greenie and I are mapped out for our first 146+ miles on the AT starting in late May. We decided that we would continue doing our section hikes moving NOBO as to be able to mingle in with the thru-hiking crowd. We have so enjoyed meeting and hiking in and around other hikers which has allowed us to make some really great connections and friends.Wingman is going to join us this year, so I am looking forward to that. I have not backpacked with him since the year we finished NJ and then did up in Maine from the NH/ME border up to Rangeley. We were laughing the other night about ""Whack and Hack"" the ""Machete brothers"" we met at Bald Pate shelter up in Maine. Between the huge machete's they carried and the biggest jar of Vaseline and cotton balls for starting fires I have ever seen on the trail...... it all makes for great memories. You never know who you will meet on the trail, that's for sure.We will pace ourselves better this time and not be too aggressive out of the box. My hamstring repair is behind me now and will be 1 year, 8 months in my past when we hit the trail this year but I don't want to blow myself out like I did last May. We will meter the miles in the first few days by slackpacking and then keeping the miles down until we ""harden off"" a little.Greenie and I also plan to get back up to Maine in the fall and button up the short section between Caratunk and Monson leaving the 100 mile wilderness until we finish everything south. We will not complete a state this year given the size of VA, but we will certainly put a good dent in it.I start my training for this year in earnest next week - and while I have been doing things to try to keep my ""edge"", I felt it better to give my body a break for a change. I will say that I feel so much better (and hurt less) when I work out/train, but if I want my legs and feet to hold up for the long run I cannot keep beating myself day in and day out over years and expect to have anything left when I am older. I still think at the end of the day I will wear out before I rust out!","Home

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/494771,"So in a little over a week Greenie and I will hit the trail to take on our next 146 mile chunk of the AT. I am really looking forward to this hike for a number of reasons:1) I am not coming off of an injury like last year when I was rehabbing from surgery to reattach my right hamstring. I feel like my old self - and hope I finish the trip without issue.2) We are doing this hike completely in the south - where last year we were on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line finishing at Thornton Gap on the southern end.3) Wingman will join us for about half of the walk. I don't think I have backpacked with him since we did a section hike on the LT (when he forgot half of the tent we shared) :>(4) Wingman is bringing his own tent this time :>)5) I am not at work!I have been out backpacking almost every day to get ready for this trip carrying about 25 pounds on my back to get myself ready. Greenie will still probably kick my butt this year - he is almost 10 years older than me and he runs regularly, hits the gym a few times a week and went downhill skiing this year about 75 times....and I am not joking. The man who's longest day as about 12 miles when we first started backpacking together is now a freaking monster who eats 18 mile days for breakfast. What have I created?I spoke to Haystack and Cimarron about my trip the other week - Haystack loved this section and raved about it in a letter he wrote to me about his trip - Cimarron skipped this section on his last AT backpack, getting off around Roanoke VA to jump up to VT. He says his AT backpacking days are over, but still gets about five miles under his feet almost every day. I can only hope to be like him should I live to be in my 90's! I made a note in my trip plan to watch for a special oak tree on the right side of the trail heading north after the Calf Mtn. Shelter. Haystack showed me a picture of the tree....it has a growth that looks damn similar to the male anatomy! A regular woody (joke)! The picture in my entry today is of a tree north of SNP, and looks like a Rhino if I ever saw one.I will try to post as I head north on this trip but you never know what the data service will be like from the trail. I should get to post at least a few times when in town or at a hiker hostel.","Home

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/496342,"So Greenie and I made the 10 hour drive down to Vesuvius VA yesterday and began our hike today. We are at the Three Springs Hostel, a newer hostel on the trail and honestly a place the feels more like home than any other place I have stayed on the trail. Uma and Marsha run the place and being with them is as much a part of the AT experience as the trail itself. We had a fantastic breakfast of pumpkin pancakes and bacon along with a yogurt parfait. ...and Lots of coffee! We got on the trail by 8:10 and found the trail and treadway smooth and easy all day. The mountain laurel was in full bloom and there was a wide variety of wild flowers all day. We met a couple of brothers from North Adams Mass. of all places and a hiker named Piston from New Brunswick Canada. We passed the Lynchburg reservoir and the 800 mile NOBO mark around the Pedlar river bridge. There were a couple of locals fly fishing in the clear river below the bridge. We stopped at the Brown Mountain Creek shelter for lunch to take an early break as our pace would have us finish by shortly after noon. When we got back to the car the two brothers were there looking to hitch a ride into Buena Vista to resupply so we gave them a lift into town and then headed back to the hostel.

It was another beautiful day. Cooler temps and lower humidity. 
We hiked over the tar jacket ridge which is a mowed bald. We saw a blue bird on a post on the ridge. 
We met Rabbit Stick from Utah near the edge of the bald. Rabbit Stick gave us the story behind his trail name. After we hiked past him Greenie, who had not clearly heard his name asked innocently, ""whats a rabbit dick?""
We stopped at cow camp shelter for lunch and continued on.

I swear she loves off-roading in the hostels Land Rover!As we started north, we marked the road location with a surveyors flag so that other hikers from the hostel could identify where they would need to turn onto Greasy Spring Road to meet Marsha later in the day.The weather today continued to be in our favor, but it was clearly getting hotter than the days prior. We bypassed the side trail to the Seeley-Woodworth shelter as we started our hike.The highlight of today was clearly finding a yellow Ladies Slipper - something I had never seen previously but had heard of before. Second to that was climbing up on Spy Rock, so named for the use of that location by confederate solders during the civil war.We passed Seeker just after finding the yellow Ladies Slipper and told her where she could find it.Se stopped for lunch at Crabtree Farm road and then made our way up to the shelter below the summit of the Priest. The climbs all day were mild, and the tread way easy.At the shelter we met Cruise Control, who had taken the afternoon off as she had badly turned her ankle. We set camp and relaxed for the balance of the day. I did some work on the shelters spring to clear leaf debris and placing rocks to create a dam making a deeper pool area for filtering and drawing water.After dinner we joined other hikers at the shelter for a campfire, contributing wood we found near our camp site. While hanging around the campfire most of the others were sitting there texting on their phones - to which I made a comment to the effect on how odd it was for us to be in such a beautiful location yet everyone was texting - it just did not seem right to me.We bedded down for the night around 8:00 after a good first day out with full packs.","Greasy Spring Road

We were up and had our tents down by 6:00 and hit the trail by 7:00 AM.As we left the shelter area we said goodbye to Cruise and wished her luck with her ankle.The climb up the priest to the summit was an easy one and the coolness of the morning made for comfortable conditions to hike. We passed a tenting area at the turn-off to the shelter where several folks had spent the night, catching the smell of coffee as we passed. We passed several other tent sites as we made our way toward the summit.The climb down the north side of the priest is a long down dropping over 3000 feet as the trail descends to the Tye River. When we hit the river it was rapidly becoming very hot and humid without a breath of air to offer any relief.We passed several other hikers as we ascended from the river crossing.We reached the side trail to the Mau-Har trail, and given the building heat of the day and knowing that the trail reconnected with the AT at the Maupin Field shelter three miles north while providing numerous opportunities to swim/get wet in the coolness of a stream, we opted to take the blue blaze trail rather than proceed north on the AT. The Mau-Har trail is far more difficult than the AT in this section and takes equally as long to hike to our destination.The route was reminiscent of northern sections on the Long Trail. Oddly, we passed Seeker heading SOBO who had opted to take the side trail as well.We stopped at an area marked for viewing waterfalls along the trail and took a break for lunch. I immersed my head in the coolness of the stream as well as washed my body and shirt to remove salt and sweat.The climb out of the ravine back to the AT after lunch pretty much erased the refreshing coolness of of the stream we had visited, but I was grateful for the relief none the less.Reaching Maupin Field we chose an area to tent and set camp.While Greenie was collecting water from the stream behind the shelter I strolled back to talk to him. As I started back up the trail I heard the distinct rattle of a rattle snake - and spied one with it's head lifted above the grass not two feet from the trail where I had just passed not a few minutes before. Note to self -  I need to be much more observant!We gave the snake a wide berth as we walked back to the shelter.We were joined at the shelter by some folks from the Warrior hike as well as Cruise who made her way that day from the last shelter where we had left her. Tinker bell arrived and chatted for a while and then headed down the trail to try to catch others heading to a brewery off of the trail that provides shuttle to and from the trail as well as a place to camp.Weed eater arrived late in the day after we had put in for the night, having knocked out a 30 mile day to make up some ground since leaving his brother at Buena Vista.In all, in spite of the heat today we had a great day on the trail.This trip is getting off to a great start!","The Priest Shelter

When we got up it was like a tent city had sprung up while we slept with all of the hikers that arrived after we turned in for the night. Weed eater had come in off of a 30 mile day and pitched his tent near ours. I could not believe that he was ""warming up"" with push-ups and other exercises to get ready for hiking that day.We said our goodbyes to those around us and hit the trail.The start of today was easy and we made the BRP in short order. We were able to get text messages out to our loved ones at home so they knew we were OK and moving for the day.We stopped at Cedar Cliffs to take in the vista and the beautiful flowering tress near the trail.We stopped at the Dripping rock parking area to draw water and take a break.After we left dripping rock, we passed some water left for hikers by ""Natural Dave"". While we did not encounter him along the trail, others behind us including Seeker and Cruise did run into him.....in all of his hiking glory in the buff! As it turns out Natural Dave is a local that likes to hike in just his boots, hat and hiking poles.We passed a couple we had been leap frogging over the last few days at the south end of Humpback Mtn. They had on full body mosquito netting ,which looked as Greenie noted more like a full body tattoo.We stopped at a rock outcropping at the north end of Humpback for lunch. The breeze kept the flies down and the sun dried us out as we ate.We had another Rattle Snake cross our path prior to the side trail to Humpback Rocks.We went down the side trail to the vista at Glass Hollow overlook. When we got back to the AT we found a tree that looked like a serpent was growing out of it. Greenie took a picture, and we hiked on.At one point as we descended into the Mill Creek area it got eerily dark and we heard some rain hitting the leaf canopy above our heads - but we kept hiking. It soon cleared and the sun was back out.AT the Paul Wolfe shelter we pitched our tents below the shelter and set about our end of day duties. Seeker showed up later as did Cruise. Cruise had turned her ankle for a third time that day and her ankle was very swollen and black and blue. She had made the decision to get off the trail at Waynesboro to let it heal for a few days - I suspect it will take much longer than that to heal based on my training.Geenie, Seeker and I sat with our feet in the cool water of the stream for a while and later that evening before hitting the hay, Greenie and I enjoyed the quiet comfort of a granite bench placed near the stream.

I love finding things like this and commented to Greenie how much history can be found in the woods if you know what you are looking for.We met up with Seeker and a two other hikers at Rockfish Gap who had already called for a ride from the trail angel list for town. We all caught a ride into town and along with Seeker, were dropped at the post office so we could collect our drop box.Greenie and I walked the short distance to the Quality Inn, who fortunately let us check in early so we could grab showers, get changed and head off to the laundry to wash our clothes.Yogi was also staying at the Quality Inn and we hoped to catch up with him later to find out about Irish, who we had heard had left the trail to attend to a medical issue.While we were at the laundry, Wingman called and we coordinated a meeting time back at the hotel sometime after 1:00 PM.When Wingman arrived, he dumped his gear in the room and we headed over to Weezie's for lunch and then over to the outfitter to get fuel and other things we needed to replenish.Later on, Wingman was to have turned in the rental car, but Greenie had something going on with his elbow, and instead took him to an urgent care facility to get it checked out. While they were gone I spoke Mr. Gizmo, a local trail angel, about a ride back to the trail in the morning. Wingman called me to tell me that he will turn the car into the rental place in the morning at no additional cost - so things worked out as good as they could.When Greenie and Wingman got back from Urgent Care, Greenie nailed me with ""I have two choices, go into the hospital or go home"".....the bugger was pulling my leg thank god but he got me good! He was given a prescription for antibiotics, a pat on the head and instructions to see his doctor when he gets home.We went to dinner at Jakes Bar and Grill downing local beef burgers and several good old southern style home cooked (deep fried) side dishes. When we got back to the hotel after dinner, Yogi came down to the room to catch us up on Irish, who as it turned out had taken the train back to NYC to have his condition looked at by his doctor at home.

He was more than happy to do so since he lived in town and it was not an inconvenience for him.Wingman turned in the rental car after breakfast and they drove him back to the hotel. Mr. Gizmo picked us up and drove us to the trail dropping us at Rockfish gap before 9:00 AM. Again, I am amazed at how hiker friendly this town is.As we started up the road to where the trail cut into the woods, a hiker by the name of Captain K. was ahead of us, moving along at a snails pace. We passed him quickly to which he quipped ""aren't I fast enough for you?"".We arrived at the SNP kiosk to register, Captain K. arriving shortly after. After filling out our forms Captain K commented that he was meeting his wife today who had an RV and then he proceeded down a blue blazed trail leading downhill away from the AT. We thought nothing of it until he announced that he realized he was going the wrong way. That was the last we saw of Captain K on this trip, although we did read in the shelter registers that he had passed us somewhere along the way.Today was proving to be another hot day, and as we were about to hit the ridge line we passed an older hiker resting on a rock, clearly carrying a pack that weighed too much. We said hello and kept on hiking.On the ridge line there was an array of things to see including a sizable red ant hill, radio and communication towers, some old tractor seats set up to rest on and some really nice vistas.We reached the shelter by early afternoon, claimed some spots to pitch our tents and ate lunch.As the afternoon progressed, the shelter became more crowded with other hikers looking to use the location as a place to land on a short day. Some hikers did push on as space was at a premium.We met some hikers from the Warrior project among others. We did have a short spot of rain during the evening hours, but nothing of significance.The bear pole was so full with food bags it looked more like a decorated palm tree than anything else.The older man we met before hitting the ridge line showed up - with a food bag that had to weigh 15 or 20 pounds. Greenie went to help him with it and had difficulty keeping the pole used to hang things on the bear pole upright. We came to find out that the guy had never backpacked before, and had aspiration of doing all of Shenandoah - we privately hoped he would get off the trail before he hurt himself or someone in the process of trying to help him. We never did see him again on our hike.Wingman did well considering this was his first day out - but he was really tired so we all bedded down early.

Typical morning for us being up at 5:30 and on the trail by 7:00 AM. As usual we are among the first to leave camp in the morning.The forest was beautiful this morning with a mix of hardwoods including some unusual oak trees. We stopped at the Sawmill overlook to take some pictures. We saw an Indigo Bunting sitting atop a tall conifer out in front of the overlook. The mountains off in the distance had that smokey blue color that gives the name to this mountain range. In the distance we could see the towers atop of Calf Mountain giving us an indication of how far we had come in a short time.The day started on the muggy side, but as we progressed the air became more comfortable.After Turk Gap I spied an old oak tree on the right side of the trail that my friend Haystack had told me about. This tree sports a very large growth that looks remarkably like the male anatomy....need I say more? We got some great photos and a lot of laughs out of it - - kind of sophomoric, but what the heck, we are just a group of guys in the woods so we let the jokes fly.We stopped at a parking area off of the trail late morning, and had snack, so we skipped eating lunch on the trail waiting until we got to the shelterWe finished today at about 1:00 and found some camping spots up behind the shelter. Not the best locations mind you, but the choices at this shelter all have some challenges.The water was good at this shelter and flowing strongly. I took a ""bath"" washing off the grime and salt/sweat from the day.We hung for a little while after dinner down a the shelter, but with all of the hikers staying there being much younger than we were, it felt a little off like ""dad just showed up and spoiled our good time"", so we headed back up to our tents to turn in for the night.Wingman was a bit tired for day two - but holding his own.","Calf Mountain Shelter

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/500771,"Well last night was a blast! NOT. At about 10:00 last night the whippoorwills started in and kept going all night long until about 5:00AM. There was one so close to my tent and Wingman's tent you could year a little chirp before they started in on their obnoxious call. There were at least two or three others off in the distance adding to the all night cacophony. I was tempted to get up an throw rocks at the little buggers if I thought it would do any good.We were up bleary eyed by 5:30 and out of camp before 7:00.We hit the summit of Black Rock Mtn. in short order and climbed the craggy peak to take in the views. It was a beautiful morning in spite of the poor nights sleep we all had.Today we were hitting the Loft Mountain camp store to resupply as well as the wayside to grab some lunch. The camp store had recently reopened and was still under construction, but at least we could get supplies. Under normal circumstances we could have showered and done laundry - but these facilities were not open due to the work being done. There were showers down at the wayside that were free due to the inconvenience.Shopping for food when you are hungry and have been eating just trail food is a dangerous thing. We all were tempted to add to our food bags in ways we would not normally do. We picked up one extra dinner and breakfast as we were not sure if we would make it to Pocosin Cabin on Monday as planned.After loading up our food bags we started to head to the Wayside for lunch. Just after leaving the camp store a deer came out of the woods and posed for us to take pictures. So far on this trip the wildlife visual count is rattlesnakes 2, deer 1 and bears zero.We hit the wayside and ordered a big whack of food for lunch. I had a bacon and mushroom cheeseburger with fries and a blackberry shake. YUM!Greenie and Wingman carried some wine boxes and beer from the wayside for consumption later tonight.Another hiker we had passed earlier in our hike came in to join us for lunch - I think her name was lightening or something like that. In either case she was fast on her feet! Her family was to meet her at the wayside that day. She told us that her Dad was bringing some home made venison jerky for her - and that if she had any left over (doubtful) that she would share some with us.At the Ivy Creek overlook we were intercepted by a fisherman looking for a fishing access to nearby streams. I had noticed a fishing sign at a road crossing and after consulting our map with us he headed off to find a place to wet his line. We took some pictures, spoke to a man and a woman riding a motorcycle who stopped for a break and headed on.We reached Pinefield hut well before mid-afternoon and found some tent sites to make home for the night. The sites were a little better than what we had last night, but were on the small side and all dirt. We did have some rain and thunderstorms in the afternoon and evening which the rain caused some splash back of dirt onto our tents, but nothing of concern.Water was flowing at the site, which had been noted as not reliable during dry periods.We sat and spoke to a father and son that stopped at the site. Other hikers came in but for the most part, thru hikers came and left but section hikers stopped and stayed for the night.Tomorrow is to be our longest day to reach the Pocosin Cabin some 18 miles north. At least with a landing at the cabin we will not have to worry about finding a place to camp. Hopefully we left the Whippoorwills behind us at the last shelter - I don't think I could take another night like last night!","Blackrock Hut

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502101,"Up and out early again this morning as we have a long way to go with a ton of elevation change to boot. Today will be almost 18 miles, but the elevation change is over 7,000 vertical feet.The good thing about doing the distance today is that we land at the Pocosin Cabin - and as a result do not have to worry about finding a place to camp or pitch our tents as the place will be all ours. I also reserved it for two nights so that if we arrive a day late, it is still ours to use. At only $30 a night for the whole place - it made doing that an easy decision.We picked up an extra day of food in case we opted to stop at Hightop Hut rather than go the distance. Weather also could play a big factor for us as well and safety always trumps miles. The plan for the day was to get to Hightop Hut, evaluate how we felt and decide to push on or not. When we get to Swift Run Gap we will make a second evaluation and either find a place to camp or hitch a ride into Elkton or push on with the Swift River picnic grounds as a final place to rest before we move onto the cabin.We made good time, reaching Hightop at the 8.2 mile mark well before noon. We stopped to water up, rest, eat and pushed on. The water at the spring here was so cold that it gave me an ice cream headache when I splashed it over my head.We opted not to eat lunch until we got to Swift Run Gap - and took a break sitting on a log just after we re-entered the woods on the north side of the gap. There were lots of cars parked here - but we only saw one SOBO hiker all day and that was about it. After eating, we went and got a poor mans spa treatment by laying on the warm asphalt along side the road between the cars parked there. The warmth was extremely soothing!We had 6.3 miles left after lunch - and for the most part we felt fairly good. The last couple of miles was a bit of flogging the dog, but we pulled into the cabin at about 4:15 - and believe me - this place was worth the walk! AS I took the key out and began to open the lock on the door I commented (paraphrasing a take from star wars movie on the approach to the death star) ""I hope this key is worth all of the lives that were paid to get it"" - and with that - released to the sizable pad lock and opened the door.The cabin is fully appointed with all of the things you would need except the food and perishables. We opened up the cabin to cool it off and hung our gear to dry out. Several folks came through to check the place out, but moved on when they saw that we were there.Of course, a NOBO hiker that came through told us about the not one, but TWO bears he saw approaching the cabin. Of course, we have yet to see one!We washed up near the spring at the cabin, rested and later on, ate a leisurely dinner out on the covered porch. We lit a fire in the outdoor fireplace and sat taking things in as night fell. I tried to convince Wingman and Greenie to take a zero tomorrow - but both wanted to keep hiking - so we will be up and out tomorrow. That being said, we did decide to ""sleep in"" tomorrow where we will not have as far to go and we are planning to stop at Big Meadows for lunch, 9.7 miles north, so we don't want to get there too early in the day.At about 8:30 it started to rain - and rained almost all night long. Believe me we all slept like rocks in the comfort of the cabin, listening to the lulling sound of rain falling on the roof. I have to come back to this place again and stay a while. There is perhaps not a better deal in all of SNP than to rent a cabin like this!Today was a tough day, but a hugely rewarding one as well.

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505127,"Today we could have taken a zero day at the cabin, but decided to ""sleep in"" instead rolling out of bed around 6:30 Vs our usual 5:30 AM. It rained fairly hard all night so we were glad to be inside Vs being outside tenting. The sound of the rain on the roof was comforting and we all slept well.We woke to a cloudy, foggy, misty sort of day to start. We took our time doing breakfast opting to eat inside the cabin. We packed up, cleaned and closed up the cabin and hit the trail. I have to come back here again some day and spend a little more time at this cabin. It is a beautiful spot and you cannot beat the price!The trail was kind and gentle for the morning hike and we quickly passed the Lewis Mountain campground. People were starting to stir for the morning as we passed - obviously a sleepy place on a damp morning.Wingman got into a groove and started banging out a 4.0+ MPH pace that was so fast that I was topped out and Greenie said he could no go any faster unless he started to run. Our speed and the mud on the trail had me ""surfing"" a few times but I did not go down (thank god).We passed an old cemetery as we approached the side trail to the Big Meadows wayside where we were going to stop for lunch today. Someone with a sense of humor did a take off of ""Naked and Afraid"" by hanging a set of clothes on a tree aside the trail and wedged a survival book between the trunk and a lower branch.There after we passed through a beautiful hardwood forest with a floor of ferns that looked much like what you would see in Pennsylvania.At a gravel road we turned to hike up to Skyline Drive to reach the Wayside. It was raining lightly as we turned on the paved road - but a short distance from where we would stop for lunch.We had a huge lunch including one of the best blackberry shakes I have ever had. It was topped with whipped cream and a drizzle of blackberry sauce. We were joined at lunch by one of the warrior group members - as it turned out he was a chaplain. I am sure he saw some horrific things in the field during his career.After lunch we walked to the campgrounds and then took the blue blazed side trail back to the AT.It was a short hike to the shelter - which was situated well below the trail. There were plenty of tent sites, but none that were very flat and with the forecast of rain Wingman and I opted to use the shelter Vs Greenie decided to tent. We had heard that flying squirrels were dive bombing the bear pole - but seeing no better place to hang our food, we opted to take a chance where we are off of the trail as of tomorrow.There were a few folks at the shelter when we arrived, and the shelter completely filled before it was dark.This was our last night on the trail for this trip - I cannot believe it is almost over.","Pocosin Cabin

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505449,"So the music and singing last night as it was getting dark was nice---up to a point, but one of the guys playing guitar should not quit his day job. Things quieted down at about 9:00 PM and for the most part I slept fairly well. ""Rod Father"", who apparently had a ""malfunction"" with his sleeping pad was jumping off of the top level over Wingman and I and eventually he went down to the cabin below the shelter and lit a fire to get warm. His hurtling off of the upper level platform was a little disconcerting as if he aimed incorrectly, he would have landed on our heads where we had our heads out toward the front of the shelter.It never really rained last night but it was another damp and cloudy day when we got up. OUr food bags did not get attacked either, so all was good as we began our final day on the trail for this trip.I wish the weather had been better for this last section as it was clear that the views would have been spectacular given that the trail ran along side an escarpment for long sections over the day. In some sections we dipped down within tall growth alongside the trail and oddly the temperature went noticeably up in those spots.On the way past Skyland and the horse stables we came across the horse head on a tree in today's picture.We stopped at the Pinnacles picnic ground for water and a break. This is a nice place with a covered pavilion with fireplaces no less.We stopped briefly at Byrds Nest #3 shelter to call Oma from the hostel to get a read on where she was at - and after finding out how far out she was, we opted to keep moving to be at the gap on time.We bypassed Mary's Rock as we were in the clouds and then started the long and rocky descent down into the gap. We only passed one trail runner and one other hiker all day today. There were also some folks tent camping near the last shelter, but we only saw their tent.As we headed down - I had a sharp pinching sensation in my lower left abdomen - I thought it was my pack belt being too tight, but when we got to the restrooms at Panorama to wash and change, I noticed a bulge that was not normal - Wingman informed me I had a hernia - REALLY? That stinks.We saw Katelyn from the warrior project at the rest rooms - I guess she was feeling better but had jumped ahead after taking some time off to get better so she could keep up with the group.We met Oma roadside at the gap - and headed back to the hostel for our last night. Overall I am falling in love with Virginia - and she is not another woman!","Rock Spring Hut

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517796,"Greenie and I have our plans more or less put together for our 2016 section hikes. We will be heading back down to Virginia in mid-April and doing another roughly160 miles starting down near Pearisburg and connecting back up north to where we started last year at Punchbowl Mountain crossing.This year will be a bit different for us in the sense it is the first time we are going to fly to get to the trail head Vs drive. Last year was about 10 hours of driving down and 12 hours back - way too much time in a car to say the least. In the late summer or early fall we will do another 65 or 75 miles up in Maine, pushing us north from Caratunk and getting us up into the 100 mile wilderness. Timing and exact distance still needs to be figured out, but there is time to work on that yet.This will be the earliest we will do a section hike in the season, and the trees will have not yet leafed out - so it will feel a little bit like fall - but I will love the cooler temperatures as I tend to bonk in the heat.Greenie and I have put a rough plan together that will see us finishing the trail within the next three years. I will turn 60 in 2018 and Greenie will be 68 so it will be a good time for us to complete our section hike of the AT. A major change in terms or work or health could change things but at least we have a plan and completion of the trail feels like it is within sight.As for what comes after that? Time and gods good grace will determine what is next. You never know what you are going to get down the road - but Greenie and I have spoken of doing the AT as a thru hike. I know that I have the JMT and the Grand Canyon on the bucket list. My son and I are also talking about doing Mt. Rainier or Mt Whitney.....Puddles is none to happy about either but one or the other would make an awesome challenge.Other than that I have to send out positive thoughts to my friend Haystack, who will be having knee replacement at the beginning of December and the second knee done around March. After seeing how Swampfox has done with his knee replacement - and he has done a lot - I know that with determination Haystack will get back to health and finish the AT. Thanks Swampfox for taking the time to talk to Haystack. I know your conversation gave him a sense that there is light at the end of the tunnel.See ya all down the trail!","Home

We had breakfast at the Friends and Family restaurant. Don was right on time at 7:30 greeting us with, ""you guys look like a couple of hikers"".We dropped our car at the finish point and Don drove us around to Johns Creek Valley where we got started walking at 8:30.Along the way to the trail head we saw more deer than I have ever seen in one place and a very large turkey.Today was beautiful weather wise. The trees have not leafed out yet, but the dogwoods and other flowering trees are in full bloom. We passed War Spur shelter where someone was still sleeping at 9:00AM. We stopped at Wind Rock where we had our first vista of the day and took pictures. We met a number of hikers going NOBO including ""big Country"", who was the heaviest hiker I have ever seen, Puzzles (she) is from Michigan and an older couple from Chicago who were also out slackpacking for the day.We Made Baileys Gap Shelter at 1:45 and took a short break. We had about another four miles to go to our car and we were moving slower than usual with all of the stops to socialize along the way.We stopped at the ""Captains"" where we zip-lined across the river to get to his place where he provides hikers with free cold drinks and a place to camp. It was about 4:00 when we finished today, but after all of the folks we stopped to talk to and a side trip for a cold soda, it was not a bad day at all.We stopped at a Mexican Eatery in town for dinner and met Ghost, who stayed with us last night at the hostel. Had some good food, funny conversation and then headed out for the Hostel. In the parking lot we met my Son's High School Math teacher and his wife who were also at the hostel last night. They are thru hiking. It is a really small world when you can meet someone from your home town in the middle of Virginia!We also met North Star, a former AMC Cru (hut worker) who will be slack packing the same section we are tomorrow. Don will be shuttling him with us tomorrow morning.Beautiful day today - good miles and feeling strong. Tomorrow is a 15 mile day so we have our work cut out for us.","USFS 156 Johns Creek Valley

Don drove Greenie and I around to the intersection of Clendennin Road and Pocahontas road were we started our NOBO hike. This section is a re-route, and we found the trail up to Rice Field a nice walk even with the elevation gain.We reached Rice Field Shelter in short order and stopped to take pictures. On the north end of the field we met a guy hunting turkeys, stopped and spoke a short while and moved on. At a power line cut crossing we saw 3 to 4 deer bolt across the cut. We passed ""Goal Digger"" as well.We took a short break at 11:00, and then passed an old apple orchard at Symms Gap Meadow.At 12:30 we took a lunch break shortly after Ground Hog Trail.The climb up out of Dickerson Gap was a more painful hike than some of the easier slopes we had tackled that day.The hike down to Pine Swamp shelter was a long series of switch backs. When we reached the shelter we met Spirit of 76 (who had also been at Woods Hole) along with a Mom, Dad and Daughter section hikers.When we got back to the car we headed into town and hit DQ where we met a number of other hikers including Santa Clause, Wonder, Ghost and North Star.Dinner was at the Mexican place again and then headed back to Woods Hole to grab showers and get ready for heading out with full packs in the morning","VA 641 Clendennin Road/Pocahontas Road

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531510,"Greenie and I had a later start today as we had to return the car to the rental place and Don had another shuttle to run before us - so we got to Friends and Family for about 7:30 AM. We had what was now our routine breakfast - the waitress has started calling me ""Hon"" so I guess we are becoming regulars here.Don met us at Enterprise rentals at 9:00 as planned and we shuttled off to John's creek Valley where we had started slackpacking on day one. We were on the trail by 9:45. We hit Kellys Knob at 11:45 for a quick break and were at Laurel Creek shelter for lunch shortly after.At the shelter I took off my shoes and socks to dry my feet out - a Pilot is always better when the landing gear is in good shape!About 1:00 it was getting fairly hot. We bypassed water at VA 42 as it looked like the cows had been using it for a toilet but found great water at VS630 sinking Creek. We passed the Keffer Oak shortly after getting water - this tree is the second largest on the trail with the Dover Oak up in NY being the biggest.Then we got a hot and nasty 960 foot climb up Sinking Creek Mountain. We took many stops on the way up and sat for a short while on a downed branch at the summit of the ridgeline.We passed a number of strange rock piles that looked more like burial grounds than anything else - but come to find out that this is how farmers down south handled clearing rocks where farmers up north build walls.We had a bit of a drop down to Sarver Hollow Shelter, and I was so tired at this point and the shelter was so nice (and empty) that we decided to stay in the shelter Vs pitch our tents.There are ruins of an old farmstead near the water source that was really cool. I got nervous about water at this site when I first got near where the water source was, but went down hill a short way to find a good flow of clean water.Bear joined us for the night as it was almost dark. I guess she got side tracked and walked a few miles out of her way before she realized she was not on the trail and had to backtrack. That happens to all of us at one time or another. She is a physical Therapist from Texas and was pleasant company.We bedded down for the night after getting at least a text message out to home to let folks know were were OK.

The entry began with ""writing this at 8:00PM - One HOT hard-ass day today! 90 degrees, not a lot of shade and the breeze was not helpful in cooling us.We were up at 6:00 AM and on the trail by 7:30. The climb up to the AT from the shelter was not hard.The trail followed the ridge line - with a steep slope in some sections and much of it on rock ledge.Took a break at Niday shelter and watered up there.Watered up again just before the big climb up Brush Mountain. The stream where we stopped had trout fingerlings in it - nice clean and cool water. There was no other water until VA 620.The hike up Brush mountain was continual switch backs that took us into the full sun and then back into the shade of pine trees - back and forth - back and forth.We stopped for lunch in the shade of the pines. I took off my shoes and socks again to dry my landing gear.Stopped at the Audie Murphy war memorial on the ridge line. I made a call home as it was the first signal we had that we could get a call out in a couple of days. Then we slugged our way onto Pickle Branch shelter.At the shelter was an older guy called ""bionic man"". He is an old ""Scouter"" and a section hiker as well. He is visiting his 92 year old mother and took some time to get some miles in during his visit.We camped below the shelter near the stream - a nice level area. We were so tired we had difficulty getting a bear bag line up and did not want to eat but did. We finally got the bear bag line up - not in my usual fashion but good enough to get us through the night (more for protection of mini-bears than anything).Closing notes in my journal: ""Losing light, Tired...Taking SHORT day tomorrow""","Saver Hollow Shelter

We broke camp and moved up to the shelter to do breakfast.We were on the trail at about 7:40 or so. Had a good up-hill to Dragons Tooth. My legs were still really trashed from yesterday - suffering from still being a little dehydrated so Greenie gave me a electrolyte tab for my water which surprisingly had almost an immediate positive effect on my ability to hike. We passed and then got passed by White Rabbit and Large who were at the shelter this morning as well (came in later last night). They stopped, but did not stay at four pinesWe dropped our packs and visited the Tooth - really cool but I was not about to try climbing it as some do.The way down Cove Mountain is really exposed as you make your way down some really open rock faces - would hate to do this section in the rain!Caught up with the Bionic Man after the tooth. Also ran into the couple from Chicago we met a few days earlier.We hit the road and did the short road walk to Four Pines, ""the friendliest hostel on the AT"".Joe the owner, is a throw-back hippie. He is retired from working for the rail road and runs his hostel on strictly donations.He flies the Confederate Flag off of the duck coop and has a sticker on his car - Alcohol, Tobacco and firearms, who is bringing the chips""There are ducks, Guinea fowl and chickens roaming free all over the place along with a few cats. Two of the cats decided they liked the shade of Greenies and my tents in the back and took up guard outside of our vestibules.It is kind of a rowdy place and sleeping inside tonight could be a challenge, so Greenie and I along with a number of other hikers opted to tent out back for the night. Spirit of 76 arrived later also opting to tent. Cabot and her boyfriend were also here for the night.the first thing we were offered when we arrived was ice-pops and soda, something we both took immediate advantage of.Most of the day folks were playing corn hole, drinking beer and smoking pot.I got a shower and we were driven to the market where I bought a big ice cream and a couple of bottles of Gatorade.

We ate breakfast outside of the hostel as to avoid the crowd inside. We headed out between 7:30 and 7:45.The trail was easy today. Early in the day some thru-hikers passed us as we hiked through some pastures. Greenie marveled that due to his size, there was no way ""Big Country"" could ever get through some of the stiles as we could barely get through with our packs on.I stopped at a water seep on the right side of the trail just before reaching McAfees knob to water up for lunch. This proved to be the last water until the next shelter.We made great time getting to McAfees knob arriving at about 12:15 or so.We took photos and broke for lunch and hung out a while before moving on.Along the way to Campbell Shelter we met a SOBO hiker that told us that water was flowing at Lamberts Meadow as he spent the night before there. That would help us make the decision to move on if we opted not to stay at Campbell.When we got to Campbell Shelter it was only 2:00. The site was more like a dirt bowl and right near powerlines - hardly an attractive place to stay. We opted to water up and keep moving onto Lamberts Meadow.Tinkers Cliffs were amazing - in many ways almost as dramatic as McAffee Knob and would have made a great place to watch the sun set if there was camping allowed in the area. The trail ran along the steep escarpment for a distance. I remarked to Greenie that this would be a bad place to be if an earthquake occurred. As we started to make the descent, we rounded under the overhang of the cliffs and I again remarked it would be a bad place to be in an earthquake. Further down the trail were some really HUGE boulders that up north we would call glacial erratics - since the glaciers were not this far south they must have landed their by rolling from the cliffs above.We are tenting tonight near the stream at Lamberts Meadow. Ghost joined us here as well. He cowboy camps and would be up and out early in the morning.When we were having our daily ""happy hour"" greenie set down the tin plate he puts the cheese and gold fish on a rock next to him. A dog owned by a thru hiker that was camping nearby came over to visit and proceeded to spontaneously drool (as in big time slobber) into the plate! Yuck! I sterilized the plate with boiling water when I cleaned up from dinner. I could not help but uncontrollably laugh at the look on Greenies face and the incident itself - another reason why I hate dogs on the trail.We have a short day now into Daleville, which will give us another nearo tomorrow. We are watching the weather for Friday as there are reports of potentially severe thunderstorms. Could be a problem but we will have to just wait and see how the forecast lines up.In all this was a fantastic day with beautiful vistas and lots to see.","Four Pines Hostel

We did breakfast, broke camp and were on the trail at about 7:30.It was nice and cool this morning with a steady and cooling breeze. The skies were mostly cloudy - a foreboding sign of a change of weather.We found the trail more kind and gentle with lots of nice views as we made our way toward Daleville. We passed several hikers heading southbound including a group of older ""dads"" and a crew of about 30+ kids and adults.We passed at more than one point high tension overhead power lines, one of which hummed so loud it sounded like you could hold your phone up in the air and have it charge itself - that or your sperm was going to swim sideways!We made Daleville and checked into the Super 8 by 11:30.Order of business was showers, lunch and laundry in that order. For lunch I ate all but one slice of a large pizza all by myself!I went to the outfitters for fuel while Greenie walked to the post office to mail some of his and my extra gear back home. Greenie termed it ""mailing our fears back home"" as when we packed and shipped our gear down to Woods Hole we were looking at snow in the area. Now, almost two weeks later the weather had turned more seasonable so we did not need some warmer gear.I met Spirit of 76 and Cabot at the outfitter who told me that the group was going to meet in the lobby of HoJo's at 6:00 PM and walk to a BBQ place for dinner. We joined the group accordingly which included 76, Bright Side, Cabot and Strummy Stick.We hit trail magic at dinner when someone paid for the groups first round of drinks. Santa and Wonder stopped by as well while we were eating.The conversation got really off color when someone showed a picture of a ""Booby Tree"" - which precipitated me showing a picture of the ""Penis Tree"" found just north of Calf Mountain shelter on the right side of the trail has you head NOBO. Needless to say there were a number of wise cracks and a lot of laughing.We are still on the fence on what tomorrow will be weather wise. I actually called a friend who works at the National Weather Service to get his perspective on the forecast.

I checked the weather forecast and radar and determined we should be good to go. It would be wet, but any thunderstorms would be scattered Vs widespread.We had light rain to start - but it was a warm rain and it felt good. We passed someone tenting alongside the trail not too far out of town but there was no signs of movement inside.WE made Fullhardt shelter in no time. I checked the radar one more time and called home. After a quick snack we were back on the trail.We hit some cold rain along the way so Greenie and I put on our rain coats -something very unusual for us as we rarely have had to use them in all of the miles we have done together.We hit the Wilson Creek Shelter by noon - some 11.2 miles already under our feet for the day. We broke for lunch. A SOBO hiker arrived at the shelter and gave us some good intel on the water situation further north - mainly being that we would not have an issue - so I checked the radar one more time, we watered up and headed out. By my calculations we would not have any really heavy rain or a chance of thunderstorms until around three this afternoon.Our pace was good - but our forward progress was hindered by the fact that someone had grayed the blazes out in many areas in this section.About three miles out from Bobblets Gap, it started to rain hard core. At about a half mile out we had three lightening strikes within a mile of our location - I was practically yelling to Greenie to MOVE IT!We hit the shelter at about 4:00 PM - soaking wet but OK. There was a guy and girl already in the shelter when we arrived (SOBO hikers) who were later joined by another SOBO hiker. Two section hikers showed up later but opted to tent. One of the SOBO hikers shared some tea bags with us which we gratefully accepted as we needed something warm in us to help recover from being so wet.We set up the bear bag line after the rain diminished and set about getting water and preparing dinner.It is now 7:49 PM and I am sitting in my sleeping bag making my journal entry.

We met Bright side not far from where the side trail to the shelter connected to the AT. He was in the final stages of packing up to get on the trail. He told us of some strange loud sounds he was hearing outside his tent last night - I guess he even got out of his tent at one point as he thought the dead branch he hung his food bag on had broken off of the tree - but it was not the case. I guess in all he had a tough nights sleep.We hit the BRP and met a bike rider who was peddling from Vancouver to DC and then to San Diego - now that is a long ride! He had hunkered down for the night under an overpass near the shelter to get out of the storm.We took some pictures at the BRP. The under-clouds were in the valley below.We made good time passing some SOBO hikers along the way. Stopping at Cove Mtn Shelter for a break we arrived to find that hikers had left a good size fire still going in the fire pit in front of the shelter. There is no water source at this shelter, so we pee'd on the fire and added in what water we could spare to knock it down to something safe. Given the fires further north I cannot believe that some idiots would leave a fire going like this!We made our way to the road crossing passing a couple more SOBO's including one guy and a lady with him - he looked like Hulk Hogan - and she did not look to be having fun!.At the road I called the campground for a ride, waiting a short while for a ride.We met Bright Side at the camp store and joined him for lunch and ice cream. The double bacon cheeseburger was to die for!. Bright Side almost went for a second one but opted to do a double dip ice cream instead.We took showers after lunch, Washed out our socks in the sink in the bathroom and dried our stuff in the camp laundry drier. I also found time to take a short nap!Greenie and I prepped our food for the next couple of days. We will have dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow at the camp store.After looking over the maps later on, and the fact that we had to pay for two nights lodging where we arrived on a Saturday, we opted to slack pack tomorrow from near the summit of Apple Orchard Mountain and hike back to the campground to spend a second night. It would give us a 13.7 mile day, but would be all down hill and we would not have our heavy gear. So after dinner, we set things up for a shuttle in the morning.The change in plans will put us a half day ahead of schedule, so we should finish early on Wednesday morning.

The tent sites in the area of the shelter were the best we had seen yet - all for the most part nice, flat and grassy.Before Bryant Ridge shelter we ran into Santa and Wonder just leaving the shelter.

Susan was there and the coffee was brewing so I paid our tab and then had some coffee on the house :>).Shoulder wide showed up, but when he realized he would have to kick in some cash for the shuttle he left the store - but then came back and went with us. Greenie and I rode in the cab of the pick-up with Tim while Shoulder Wide rode in the back sitting on a bunch of straw..We were at the trail head at 8:15, pointed Shoulder Wide in the right direction, said out goodbyes and headed NOBO. We passed Thunder Hill shelter in short order, finding a note on the trail just before the shelter telling folks that there was no water at the shelter but where to find it nearby.The trail was easy going this morning - it is so nice to go over a mountain but never actually climb it. Yesterday we went from the summit SOBO and today we went from the summit NOBO!Along the way we passed a package thumbtacked to a tree with a note that it was for a NOBO German hiker. We stopped at an overlook shortly after and took some pictures.We had fields of Mayapples and other flowers like Trillium this morning that stretched as far as the eye could see.We had lots up ups and downs and then up over Highcock Knob. On the way up the knob we met an older couple training for another long distance hike. They were here from Maine and had previously done the AT- and I think we disturbed/caught the woman who was trying to sneak a pee! We passed Marble Spring at 11:30 AM, where we had originally planned to camp but with the change to our hike will not. We kept going until the Sulphur Spring North trail crossing and broke for lunch. Three ladies on horses came through and stopped to talk for a short while then moved on.We stopped by Big Cove Branch where we watered up. I splashed water on my head and neck to wash off and scared a large frog in the process. Got to Matts Creek shelter at 2:30, but opted to go about another mile to camp down by the James river. There was some traffic on the road across the river and train tracks to boot - I HOPE this is not like what we had outside of Boiling Springs with the trains running all night!.We had dinner and were in our tents at 7:00 PM. Tomorrow is our last full day on the trail and with less than 12 miles to the Punch Bowl Mountain shelter it should not be a bad day, but we have a bit of climbing to do to get there.I cannot believe that this trip is almost over. We will have averaged about 14.5 miles a day and do a total of 160 miles. My feet hurt a bit today and old injuries are kicking back a little. Next long trip I need to build in a good mix of shorter and long days and enough nearo days to give my body a break. I am realizing that if I had to push on too many more days without a break I could end up injured - something I do not wish to do.","Upper BRP crossing at mile post 76.3

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534165,"Last full day on the trail today!We had ""Trains, traffic and Whippoorwills"" last night. I finally put in my earplugs to block out the sounds. We had four trains go by between 10:00PM and 5:45AM. I finally gave up and started moving at 5:45 with the last train through - and I had to deal with natures call...Had breakfast and packed. We were up and out by 7:35AM. We hit the James River Footbridge at about 8:00AMWe took some pictures and started the climb to John's Hollow shelter which would be the last place to get water before we finished the days hike at Punchbowl Mountain. We passed a guy just starting his hike on the way up.At the John's Hollow we met a guy named ""Crow"" - a local who was out for a section hike. We drew water and started on our way up.This was a big climb today - going from 678' at the river to 3,391' at the summit of Bluff Mountain. We passed fullers rocks and Big Rocky Row that had some great vistas along the way.It was getting ""hot as balls"" today - and I was beginning to feel the impact of the heat on my ability to climb/move.On the ridge line we passed a couple of section hikers called ""Five Weeks"" and ""Bushwhacker"".We stopped for lunch after the summit of Bluff Mtn, sitting in the shade of a large Hemlock tree. After lunch Greenie told me to take the lead and ""Take us Home, Pilot"". We arrived at the shelter before 2:00PM.""Pigeon toed"" was at the shelter - he started in February to beat the crowds.We washed up, drew water and sat at the picnic table in front of the shelter where I made journal entries on the day. Two guys arrived with two dogs while I was writing - god I hope they move on or at least tent far away from the shelter. Greenie and I intend to camp in the shelter tonight as it is going to rain and with our heading home on Thursday we want to finish with our gear as dry as possible.Pants and Zen Master arrived along with Spirit of 76. One other NOBO from California joined us later in the day. 76 opted to tent as she prefers that.Pants made a smokey camp fire to keep the bugs down. Good conversation degraded to discussion about ""pooping in the woods"" and the book ""How to shit in the woods"". '76 thought it was funny that such a book exists!. Zen Master pulled out a porcelain tea set and made tea for the group as we sat around talking.  It started to rain and thunder so we all packed it in for the night. Last night on the trail - tomorrow - we head to Three Springs.","Tent area near James River

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534750,"A big part of hiking the trail are the people you meet. In the case of last night, Pants, Zen and '76 are all artists. '76 paints in oil and is apparently successful as she can make a living off of her art - not something that most artists can do. Zen and Pants are either finishing or just finished school but in either case have not been able to deploy their skills to earn a living. In all, they are great folks and I am glad that I had the opportunity to meet and share the trail with them.I did not sleep so well last night. The frogs sang on and off all night and I kept waking and looking at my watch. The frog song was really strange - one would start, then a couple more would join in - then the whole freaking pond would join in.....then all of a sudden they all stop at the same time ....and it was strangely quiet. Then the whole damn thing would start over and over and over again.I got up at 4:00 to pee and tried to get back to sleep. I finally gave up at 5:50 AM and started packing up. We were meeting either Oma or Marsha from Three springs at the BRP at 8:00 - so there was hardly any rush needed.'76 joined us for breakfast and after all was said and done, we left the shelter at 7:25 having nothing left to do but hike to the road.We were at the BRP in such short order we should have waited another 10 or 15 minutes to leave - but here we are - 159.3 miles and 46,000 vertical feet in elevation change later - done with our big walk for 2016. It is funny how these things play out. There is a ton of planning, preparation and training that goes into a hike like this. The logistics alone can be mind boggling. I worked on this trip for at least six or so months. Then there is the anticipation that the trip is actually happening - that series of moments where you worry you forgot some critical thing or screwed up the trip flow plan and miscalculated the miles or something silly like that.Then the trip actually happens. It feels at first like an out of body experience - WOW, we are on our way! Then the actual walk begins, and it feels like you have finally come home. The comfort of seeing those white blazes ahead of you, the feel of the earth under your feet, the smell and sounds of the forest around you and the magic that you find along the way.And, before you know it, all of the planning, miles, experiences and encounters are now behind you. All you can think about after is getting back to the trail. The sense lingers as you follow the progress of the folks you met on the trail, letting the miles that they are now experiencing that you have already walked play out in your head.None of this would be possible if not shared with my hiking buddy Greenie, as I would not take on an endeavor such as this alone. I so admire his love and passion for the trail and envy his ability to write and record our experiences. He always sees things with a different lens than I do. But having been a writer professionally he has honed his skill by experience. I always get the feeling that if he could stay and keep hiking he would. Just as getting on the trail feels like coming home, leaving it feels like moving away to a foreign place. I gain comfort in knowing that I can always go home.","Punchbowl Mountain shelter

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546737,"Greenie and I were up early this morning and drove up to Monson where we connected with Rebecca, the owner of the Lake House in Monson, to be shuttled down to Caratunk where we would pick up the trail NOBO.Greenie and I have tried to do this section two previous times and both times we had to cancel due to my having to have surgery -the fist time to reattach my hamstring and the second time for a hernia.Rebecca was laughing as she fully expected to see us bag again so I could have another operation....but not this time!We got to Monson at 11:15 AM and had lunch at a picnic table behind the Lake house.Rebecca (or should I say her daughter who is working on getting her license) drove us to Caratunk leaving Monson around noon. It was interesting sitting in the backseat while Rebecca's daughter drove and Rebecca sat in the front passenger seat with one foot on the dash and the other out the passenger side window. Her daughter drove well, but the road was narrow and the speed limit on the faster side....We made the trail head in about an hour and started hiking at about 1:15. The hiking was easy and we made the shelter by about 3:30.We are tenting near the shelter tonight. Backbone and one other hiker are here for the night as well. I checked the shelter register and Strummy Stick who we met earlier this year down in VA passed through about a week ago. We also found out that Spirit of 76 was about a week behind so we will not see her on this trip.After dinner we went down to the lake to wash up and then turned in for the night. The wind was picking up and some light rain expected toward morning but nothing serious.A good first day on the trail - it is always nice to be following the white blazes again!","Caratunk

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546915,"I sort of slept last night. I kept hearing a small animal outside my tent moving around. The wind was blowing through the treetops but slacked off in the early morning hours. It rained lightly around 3:15 AM but nothing hard.I woke up at about 5:00AM and was packing up around 5:15. Greenie and I had our usual breakfast and coffee and were on the trail by 6:30.We made the summit of Pleasant pond Mountain in about an hour and stopped to text home that we were up, moving and all was good. The text actually went through Canadian towers so I am guessing I will get an international charge on my bill this month.One of the NOBO hikers met us at the summit and then passed us for good after about a half hour later.We stopped at the inlet stream to Moxie Pond to filter water and moved on.We broke for lunch at Bald Mountain shelter around 11:45. Two other hikers stopped by while we were there, but moved on before we did. There was some water at the shelter - nothing moving but at least not stagnant so I drew what additional water I needed to finish the day. This section of trail is really dry and opportunities for water very limited.The climb up Moxie Bald was not hard, but the heat was increasing and my legs were spent. I let Greenie go on ahead as the heat does not effect him the way it does me. On the way up I passed a rock formation that reminded me of Piazza rock north of Rangeley - smaller but similar.At the summit a SOBO woman met up with us, asked directions on where the trail continued and moved on.Greenie and I picked blueberries near the summit - some of the best berry picking I had seen in a long time!The hike down was about two miles, and we called home prior to leaving the summit as we had service. The last mile seemed to take forever.We set camp away from the shelter in a nice flat area that was near the pond. After camp was set, we went down to the pond to swim and water up. MAN was that worth it! I love swimming and in spite of some hikers saying that they saw some leaches (we did not) the water was clean, clear and refreshing.We did dinner after cleaning up and then started to pack it in for the night. Another hiker arrived as we were finishing dinner and set camp just below where we were tenting.14.6 miles on the AT tomorrow plus the walk into town so we will walk about 17 miles total tomorrow. The terrain looks easier so I am sure we will make a good pace.Dinner in town tomorrow and ice cream so we will be highly motivated.

I woke up to him making a wise crack if I was going to get up today or not - so I was moving by 5:00 and we broke camp and were moving by 6:15 AM.The trail was easy going today and the temps were much cooler than yesterday. I am amazed at how dry it is out here with the first moving water we crossed being at Bald Mountain Stream. We walked along side rivers and streams most of today - so water was not an issue as it was yesterday.The crossing at the West Branch of the Piscataquis River was a rock-hop. a rope over the stream told of the crossings difficulty during high water.We made Horseshoe Canyon Shelter by ~ 10:00, stopped and spoke to a hiker we had seen several times on this trip and moved on.We were at the East Branch of the Piscataquis at about 11:00, where we stopped to water up, cool off in the clear flowing water and eat an early lunch.. Here again a rope across the river told a story of how hard crossing the river must be at times of high water - but today was only a rock hop.A larger group of hikers showed up as we were preparing to leave. We spoke briefly and moved on.My feet today are already sore given the miles and newer shoes - so soaking my feet in the river felt wonderful. When we got going again my feet had actually shrunk so my shoes felt loose for the first mile or so.We hit the blue blazed side trail by 1:00 and were on our final approach to Monson. We stopped at a place on the road walk that was a lodge in the making. The owner gave us some cold sodas and showed us the place. He has put a lot into the place and intends to make it like an old Maine sporting camp. From what he said he caters to section hikers but discouraged thru-hikers from staying due to some bad experiences he had in the past.We checked into the Lake House when we got into Monson with our top priority getting cold drinks, showers and dinner. We walked over to the ATC office after we ate to see what they had going on there and then walked over to an ice Cream place to top off our dinners.It is 6:38 now and I am sure I will turn in early for the night.

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548137,"So 2016 was a successful year hiking the AT. Greenie and I buttoned up about 197 miles of trail and had some wonderful experiences along the way. I managed NOT to have an operation for a change, and overall had a good level of physical performance - but there is always room to improve as to make the ride more enjoyable.It is beginning to feel very real that we will in fact finish the entire trail. With about 700 miles left to walk, The plan to finish this by 2019 while I am 60 and Greenie is 70. Gads, when the heck did we get so ""old""? But age is relative. As a reference point, I met ""Cimarron"" the year when he turned 87 while on the trail. He did not move fast, but he moved and did over 1.000 miles that year! Cimarron turned 95 this year and he still walks about five miles a day - more than a lot of folks more than half his age walk in a week or a month.I need to celebrate all that Greenie and I have done since coming together to hike the trail.Since 2012 when we connected, we have put more than 800 miles of the AT under our feet. Together we completed almost 170 miles of the Long Trail (we did the other section before we knew each other) - finishing that trail together. In 2017 we will pass the 1,000 mile mark hiking together and in all of that time we have only had ""words"" once - and largely because of me. As my Dad once told me with just a little practice I could be a ""perfect pain in the ass"" and in this case I guess I got pretty good at it.I have done a ton of growing up over the last several years, and my time hiking with Greenie has made me a better person. Also, the trail is an amazing teacher of life skills.Next year we will fly down to Georgia and start walking back up to Pearisburg VA, our furthest southern point on the trail. We are sticking to the plan to jump back up to Monson once we have finished the southern end to finish that final section, thus completing the trail. Finishing it as it should be - together and at Katahdin.

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553825,"So our plans are in place for our walk in 2017. Greenie and I discussed if we would pick up south of Pearisburg VA and walk NOBO back to Pearisburg or skip all the way south to Springer and start there this year.The challenge of going south of Pearisburg was that we would have to either start earlier in April and run the chance of hitting winter weather or start at about the same time as we did last year and really start hitting the ""bubble"". Starting later was not an option as we did not want to hit the really hot weather.We decided to head to Springer and work our way NOBO, eventually closing the gap between there and Pearisburg.So we will head south this spring and walk up to Fontana Dam some 166 miles over 14 days of walking. We are then going back south in the fall and continuing from Fontana Dam and walking some 74 miles north to give us a total of 240 miles this year. After this year we will have less than 500 miles left to finish the trail.Should be a great year!","Home

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565123,"Normally I would enter my journal entries for each day of a section hike, but in the interest of time and effort I am abridging this to be one summary entry for a 14 day backpack.
In all of the miles Greenie and I have covered ( as of this trip we passed the 1000 miles hiked together mark), this trip stands out as being different than any other. Perhaps it was the fact that the weather presented some challenges - we actually had to use our rain gear almost every day (something we oddly rarely had to do in all of our previous miles) due to precipitation, wind or both. We had to break camp with wet gear and dry it out more than once . But the biggest difference this trip Vs. our previous section hikes was we found ourselves hiking among a host of folks that were inexperienced, had the wrong gear, too much gear, did not know how to use what they had or had not developed a sense of trail etiquette yet.
After this trip I can see why so many folks get off the trail within the first 30 to 60 miles. #newbiestothetrail
We started out the trip by flying to Atlanta from Boston, taking the train to North Springs where a driver from The Hiker Hostel (no longer called that by the new owners) met us and drove us north to the hostel where we would spend the night. It was a crazy ride to the hostel, with the van travelling at speeds of 75 MPH or sometimes faster. That first night we listened to folks talk about gear and all the stuff they had done, when most of them by the looks of it never got any further than a Youtube video on backpacking. Greenie and I kept our mouths shut not wishing to engage in the conversation.
The ride on Saturday morning was just as thrilling as the ride to the hostel. The van felt like is was skipping around corners on two wheels more than having four wheels on the ground....but we arrived at the parking area just north of Springer alive and intact. If my bladder could speak after the ride to the trail-head I would hate to hear what it would say!
We hiked SOBO to Springer, tagged the southern terminus/signed the register and turned our feet northward. That first night on the trail was one of the worst storms I have camped in. Some folks had total tent failure (one guy had to be extracted due to hypothermia), but Greenie and I were OK. Our tents were wet, but we and our (important) gear was dry. We heard that some folks with (Walmart) tents walked away leaving their tents behind. We saw no less than five or six tents/hammocks abandoned along the trail - most of the gear being from none other than Walmart. I think Walmart should pay the ATC for trash and tent removal...or get out of the tent business.
We spent our second night on the trail in the Gooch Mtn. shelter, stacked like cord-wood with other hikers. But folks were polite and respectful. The third night out we got a cabin at Blood mountain cabins so we could dry our gear and hit the re-set button.
Passing through Tesnatee Gap on day four, we met my cousin David and his son who were doing a father son trip hitting the high points of several states. It was great to see them and best of all was the craft beer they gave to Greenie. I think he would have taken anyone down that tried to take that beer away from him, kind of like a big cat guarding a fresh kill...
After Neels gap our first real bed and shower we had was at the Top O'Georgia hostel - a fairly new place on the trail but well run. They provide all of the hikers scrubs to wear while their laundry is getting done. Many of the hikers opted to wear the scrubs into town for dinner looking like a surgeon's convention was going on in town that included a practical lab as a part of the event.
We saw a lot of forest fire damage on this walk - some of which was outright total destruction. The fire damage started after Plumorchard shelter and while was sad to see, nature has a way of recovering. To our dismay, we had some yahoos at Wesser Bald shelter who saw fit to have a campfire at the shelter. The tenting area was down-wind of the shelter so the smell was disturbing. Even after Greenie spoke to the folks they were hell bent on having a fire anyhow. #dumbassesgohome
One of the nicer hostels we stayed at was the cabins at Nantahala Mountain Lodge. The place was exceptionally clean and the meals were wonderful. The folks who own and run the place are a little over the top in terms of having us leaving all our gear in a ""mudroom""  shed (NOTHING can go into the hostel) and sending us directly to the showers when we arrived. It kind of made us feel a little uncomfortable - but I get their precautions due to bed bug issues further south of there - which is why we opted to stay there in the first place. Also, if you want food from the little shop they have you better get it when you can. They lock the shop up when they are not there and it is not like you can walk to town (not even close by) to get stuff. Greenie was happy that they actually had beer available :>)
I cannot say enough about the NOC - what a great place to stay and the food was great. We ended up staying there for two nights Vs the original plan of one. We got some shuttle assistance from Donna and her husband from Cabin in the woods to slack pack the last two days to Fontana Dam. The weather and high winds we had over those two days made us glad we did not camp in the woods that last night. There was a 95 MPH wind gust in the Smokies just north of us and the blow-downs were crazy. They were actually kicking hikers out of the Smokies and the one road in the middle of the park was closed. The Fontana Hilton had about 40 folks there Thursday night due to the weather.
Donna's husband dropped our heavy packs at the Hike Inn for us and lent us some day packs to use on the last two days. I took some heat over the ""fashionable"" color of my pack - that I am OK with that.
We finished our trip at The Hike Inn. I had only spoken to her on the phone, but I felt like I had known Nancy there forever. She took us into town for dinner and she had a shuttle take us back to Atlanta dropping us at the MARTA station. We took the train from North Springs back to the Airport due to the bridge that was destroyed still being a problem.","Springer Mountain
",Fontana Dam,"Apr 22, Sat",166.30
Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581206,"So this update is long overdue
I had always wanted to do the Smokies in the spring. The wildflowers, flora and fauna there is the most diverse in the entire USA. There are more kinds of trees and plants per square mile to be seen - but as it turned out we ended up doing the Smokies in the fall. As a section hiker one can usually plan to hike a section at the time of the year you want, but Greenie and I are keeping our walk so that we don't leave gaps, and so with that - our experience was more along the lines of what a SOBO thru hiker would see. In all, less bugs, cooler days and nights....it is all good.
We were joined on this trip by Wingman, who had not really hiked with us since we did the Long Trail. Wingman learned really quickly that what I had told him was true - that is the Smokes are no joke. The elevation change each day we were on the trail was usually at least 4,000 feet, and a couple of days were over 5,000 and 6,000 feet in change. That and the fact that we had a couple of 15 mile days tossed in we had a lot of work to do.
We started this trip by flying down to Knoxville Tn and were shuttled to the Hike Inn via one of Nancy's usual drivers, Andrea, who had driven us before. Andrea and Nancy are sweethearts, and although I have only met them a couple of times I feel like they are old friends I have known forever. After collecting our drop box of food from Nancy and prepping our gear for the morning, Andrea took us into town for dinner. We passed her place, right near the AT, along the way into town. She is selling her house so she can build a new place on a section of her land she already subdivided as a new lot. She is an architect by trade and wants to build a custom home in which she will retire. I hope her dream comes true
 In the morning we were off to Fontana Dam to pick up where Greenie and I left off in the spring. The weather was on our side today with fog at the lower levels, but cleared as we gained elevaton....and it felt good to be back on the trail again. Now Greenie and I call ourselves the ""no bear brothers"" as we have YET to see a bear on the trail - so wouldn't you know that Wingman was taking point and within the first couple of hours sees a damn bear - which Greenie and I could not see from our vantage points! 
The climb up to Shuckstack Mountain fire tower is worth  the side hike. Wingman commented that he thought he was ready for the hike, but the first couple of hours had him admitting he was not as ready as he thought. Even with that, he soldiered on without complaining. Water was not running very well along this section of trail, and we had to use rhododendron leaves to make a drop to catch water that was flowing. We skirted a yellow jackets nest about 1.5 miles south of Mollies Ridge, our destination for the first night. The shelter had the biggest mice I had ever seen, so we opted to hang everything including our packs not only that night, but every night on the trail.
Friday AM we were up with first light. The hike for the first part of the day was not bad. We stopped at Russell Field Shelter for a water break, and hiked on. We stopped at Spence Field shelter for lunch. The shelter is closed for overnight stay due to bear activity, and given all of the berry bushes in the area I can see the attraction. We had good water here.
After lunch the hike up Rocky top had lots of nice open views - then we walked over to Thunder Mountain where there we no views to be had. It was a stiff drop down into Beechnut Gap. We watered up on our way to Derrick Knob Shelter, not certain on the availability of water there. As it turned out the water was flowing, but it was down hill a bit and we had to rework the spring pipe to get the water flowing better. At the shelter some kid with his Dad was on the top level, and spilled water on my sleeping bag below on the lower level - clearly an accident, but pissed me off since he did not tell me when it happened.
Saturday AM we were up and out early again, but the later sunrise makes for a later departure than we are accustomed to. It was a really tough climb up Silers Bald shelter for Wingman, We watered up as there was no water at Double Spring Gap shelter. Wingman was anxious about the elevation, and told us he was having difficulty breathing. Other than shortness of breath he had no other symptoms. At the end of our hike he discovered he had a spider bite, which leads me to believe that he might have been having a reaction to the bite that day.
The climb up Mt. Buckley had the best views since Shuckstack Mtn and the climb was not as bad as we had expected. In fact the walk up Clingmans Dome was much easier than I had expected.
We stopped at the tower at Clingmans Dome, which was closed for renovations, but the Ranger there not only took our trash but gave us some cookies! Trail Magic at the perfect time in our walk! 
Our hike to the Mt. Collins shelter took longer than I had expected, but Wingman was moving very slow at this point of the day. We met a family at the side trail junction leading to the shelter. They later came down to see the shelter and asked us a lot of questions about hiking the trail. We had a bit of company at this shelter (all new folks to us and some to the trail). A woman we met was from Cape Cod as am I. Many late arrivals at this shelter, and a number of folks that were not considerate of us trying to sleep, drinking and talking loudly until about 10:00 PM, in spite of the fact that we had told them we would be up and out tomorrow before first light. One SOBO thru hiker adding to the cacophony was bragging about his yogi skills, picking up more food than he started with, and how he instead of paying for the half gallon challenge, took a half gallon of ice cream in a grocery store and ate it as he walked around the store. If he finished it before he was done shopping he put the empty container back on the shelf and did not pay. What a leach!
We were up before first light and packing out in front of the shelter in the cooking area. The SOBO hiker at the shelter got up and in my face calling me either a newbie to the trail or an asshole for packing up so early in front of the shelter. When I told him that I was not new to the trail with 1700 miles under my feet he told me that I was an asshole. I will not repeat what I said, but we finished packing up and hiked out by headlamp toward Newfound Gap. I was more pissed about being called a newbie than an asshole, but in all of my miles on the trail I have never met someone like this guy and I hope I never meet someone like him again.
We reached Newfound gap by 9:15, met our shuttle and was in Gatlinburg by 10:15 AM. We checked into the hotel, but our room was not ready so we went for breakfast and did some shopping. I love nearo days as you get town food, clean clothes and a shower!
Tomorrow, we hike out toward Standing bear and have two 15 mile days ahead of us. I hope Wingman is up to the task as they will be very long days!","Fontana Dam
",Standing Bear Hostel,"Sep 28, Thu",74
Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581238,"We started off the second half of the Smokies with two very long days. But where the first half was more or less like walking in the woods just about anyplace - From Mt. Buckley North the Smokies are spectacular. 
We had breakfast at the hotel and the driver from ""A Walk in the Woods"" (I highly recommend them - on time, friendly and helpful) was early for our pick-up which was just fine for us.
The ride back up to Newfound gap was a beautiful one, and shortly after getting dropped off at the parking area we were on our way north. Wingman was feeling better after having a good rest, and the views along the way lifted his spirits. I thought when we first got to Newfound gap that he was going to bail on us when we got to town, but he was determined to finish this walk, and the beauty that surrounded us made the miles fall away. The northern section of the Smokies is one of the few sections I would go back and do again - it is that magnificent.
We made Ice water spring shelter in no time and took a break/watered up. We had reservations for this shelter for the previous night when we were in town and had staying at the shelter as an option if we only wanted to do an in and out of town, but the lure of town meals and all the trappings that go along with being in town had us all opting for a longer day today and not skipping town.
Continuing North, we made Charlies Bunion in no time, and the side hike there was well worth it. We stopped and took many pictures and spoke with other hikers there, and then walked on. We stopped at the side trail for Peck's corner shelter to see if we could get water, but none was flowing so we pushed on.
We marveled at this section of trail, and how the folks that built it did such an amazing job connecting the peaks via ridge walks - many of the connections were man made by the CCC before WWII.
We made Tri-Corner Knob shelter late in the afternoon as our pace was slower than usual, but it was more important for Wingman to finish the trip than for us to push too fast, and the views today had us stopping frequently to take pictures or just look.No matter how you slice it, a 15 mile day and almost 6,000 feet in elevation change makes for a long day. 
A group of hikers were already at the shelter, some of whom were at Icewater Spring the night before and noted that there had been room for three more hikers than were there. We set about making camp, getting water and hanging our gear. This shelter is the most remote in the entire Smokies, and is a beautiful spot with great water and a damn nice privy - one of the few in the Smokies.
We were up and out later than usual on our last full day on the trail, but the late sunrise and being in a shelter makes for a slower up and out. I so miss tenting on the trail, and hope I don't have to use a shelter for many miles after this trip. It is just so much more effort to keep control of your gear and work around other hikers stuff. Folks at the Tri-Corner Knob were considerate and seasoned hikers, and we were all around the same age which meant we all had a bit in common. At this shelter we met Roadrunner and Bambi, who we would also share our last night on the trail with at Davenport gap shelter. We agreed that whoever got there first would reserve the lower bunk for our group. We expected to be leap frogging them all day long but they ultimately ended up finishing before us. We caught up to them at Crosby Knob Shelter, a shelter that was closed due to bear activity and the closing of which forced us into to 15 mile long days to skip the shelter. Bambi and Roadrunner were just finishing lunch when we arrived. They moved on and we settled in to have our lunch and water up. This was a great place to stay had it been open - but between the signs and motion activated wildlife cameras it was obvious that the area was not safe to camp.
By the time we pulled into Davenport Gap shelter it was late in the day again. Bambi and Roadrunner had held space for us as promised, but the top platform was actually nicer given that the shelter had some odd supports that interfered with the lower bunk, so I slept up top instead. The same thing that happened to me with spilled water on the top platform and leaking down onto gear below happened to Roadrunner this time. The folks that did it were a bit obtuse - and Roadrunner was pissed to say the least.
Today was also Bambi's birthday - and Roadrunner had packed in a cake and somehow managed not to crush it - and we all sang happy birthday to her as she blew out the candle he place on top of it. I had some extra cookies in my food bag since the ranger had given us additional cookies on the summit of Clingmans Dome, so I gave her  a package of double stuffed Oreos for her birthday. Meeting folks and the social aspects of hiking the trail is special. Our chance meeting of Roadrunner and Bambi, sharing a section of trail and shelter along with celebrating a special day with them underscores this.
The Davenport shelter is one that I hope to never visit again. It is dank and dark, and is loaded with my personal favorite (NOT) Wolf Spiders. We managed to sleep this last night on the trail, but were up before light and packing up.
The last few miles to Standing bear was not difficult, but Wingmans knee had taken a beating after two 15 mile days and lots of elevaton change. We had an extended section of down over the last part of the trail, and his IT band was not happy about it. Wingman who usually loves down and hates up, was not happy but again continued to push on to finish.
We caught up with Roadrunner and Bambi as they were heading back to the trail from Standing Bear after picking up some supplies. They would push onto Elmers at the end of their hike where our hike this trip ended at Standing bear. We said our goodbyes, and they headed north while we walked up Green Corner Road to the hostel.
We had the cabin reserved at Standing bear, and while it was musty smelling inside, it was nice to have a roof over our heads, hot food to eat and a shower to wash the trail off. Greenie and Wingman enjoyed a few beers, and we all shared in the success of this walk.
Greenie and I only have 399 miles left to finish down south - from Green Corner Road up to Pearisburg VA - and then our final push from Monson up to Katahdin. It is hard to believe that after section hiking since 2004 we are almost done with our walk of the entire AT. Our plans are already done for the Spring of 2018, and as I worked on the balance of the south the other day - it really hit me how close we are now to being done - as for the first time, I ran out of trail to hike in my guidebook.","New Found Gap

We will be in Hot Springs tonight and then get shuttled to our starting point by Standing Bear to begin our NOBO walk.The weather looks great for the first several days which always makes for a good start. Looking forward to being on the trail again!,"Home

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589912,"Over the last two weeks, Greenie and I hiked one of the more magnificent sections we have done to date.  We completed between Standing Bear and Roan Mountain and knocked one more state off of the AT list. We are inching closer to having the entire trail under our feet and expect to finish next year.
Travel from Boston to Hot Springs was uneventful. Both our gear and Greenie and I arrived in Asheville on time and together (whereas the opposite happened on our return trip), Matt from Elmer's was waiting for us when we arrived and we were at Elmer's in no time.
Elmer's as a place to stay is showing it's age, and if they are going to keep the place running over time they are going to have to put some money into the place. While the accommodations are relatively clean, the physical structure and infrastructure needs extensive work. The rooms, while comfortable, are in dire need of paint and  plaster work. We did not partake in any of the infamous meals while there. But we did hear from those that did that the food was extraordinary. We instead ate at the Iron Horse and the Smokey Mountain Diner, both great choices.
We arrived too late to mail our bounce box to our finishing point, so Matt mailed it for us after dropping us off at Green Corner Road near Standing Bear on Friday Morning.
Friday coming NOBO out of Green Corner road was a climbing day. Our goal was Hawks Roost, but we opted to camp off of the Rube Rock Trail where we found a great spot to tent that was level and well off of the AT.
Saturday was a perfect day for hiking - both cool and dry. We crossed Max Patch in the morning at about 10:00 AM, finding both trail magic before our climb consisting of candy bars and bananas and hikers still in their tents camped on the shoulder of the ridge line. Max Patch was spectacular - and even with a stiff wind blowing we felt like we were in magic land. We camped at Walnut Mountain shelter that night. Not a bad place to camp but it was really windy and we woke on Sunday morning to 33 degree temps. I was glad I opted to bring my warmer sleeping bag!
Sunday morning, we had breakfast at the shelter to get out of the cold winds. One hiker who spent the night there woke to find Ramen noodles in his boots - and had no idea how it got there as no one in the shelter had Ramen with them. Here we met ""Pensioner"" for the first of many times on this hike.
We connected with our friend ""Sunkist"" at Garenflo Gap at about 11:00 AM. She was to hike the balance of the trip with us, but opted to get off of the trial in Erwin. We all walked back into Hot Springs around 2:00 PM and headed to Elmer's where we cleaned up and would spend the night. 
Monday AM we were up and out of Hot Springs at 7:40 AM after doing breakfast at the Smokey Mountain Diner and squaring off with Elmer. The hike up from the French Broad River was steep, but had some wonderful views. Weather today was a ""10"", but a tad warmer and more humid than previous days. Our destination was Log Cabin Drive and the Hemlock Hollow cabins. We walked out of Hot Springs with only our food for the day, and would have a food drop at Hemlock Hollow with four days of food which would carry us over til Erwin and Uncle Johnnies. The excitement of the day was stopping off at an old Mom and Pop General store at TN 70 where Greenie and I each bought and devoured two ""Big Boy"" ice cream sandwiches! We finished at Log Cabin Drive at 4:15, but waited for the shuttle to pick us up at 5:00 since we thought we would take longer to reach the meeting spot. We had Pizza and sodas for dinner at Hemlock Hollow, and the cabin and facility was clean and well maintained. Too bad the lady running it had lost her help that day and was trying to run the place by herself. It is only her second season and does not have things down as pat as someone more seasoned. She even had a slack packer whose pack got taken by accident to another hostel and she had to drive two hours to retrieve it. Too bad, and I hope she figures things out and gets some good help.

The following four days we worked our way north to Erwin and Uncle Johnnies. Highpoints include the views at White Rock Cliffs, Black Stack Cliffs and lunch at ""Howards Spot"" near the memorial plaque. Deb found out when she was setting camp for the night at Jerry's Cabin Shelter, that her sleeping pad would not hold air. We tried to repair it but to no avail. Wednesday was a hot one and I got smoked by the heat. We got some well timed trail magic at the crossing of TN352/NC 212 in the form of soda and banana's. We keep hitting a large (and loud) bubble of thru hikers - it is amazing to me that these folks have not figured out some trail manners by this point in their hike. We pushed 13 miles on Thursday and Friday to get into Erwin early Friday afternoon and avoid weather coming in on Saturday.
We took a zero on Saturday - which was nice, but Sunkist opted to get off of the trail that day which was a bummer. She had been away from home for an extended time period leading up to this trip, and wanted to go home to see her Husband and family.
We Slackpacked on Sunday from Beauty Spot SOBO back to Erwin and hit the trail NOBO starting at Beauty Spot on Monday with the objective of reaching Roan Mountain TN at Highway 19E and Mountain Harbour by Wednesday. This was a beautiful section of trail with passing through what felt like an ""enchanted forest"" on the way up to Roan High Knob, More amazing balds including Round Bald and Hump Mountain. We spent our last night on the trail at the Overmountain shelter which was crowded and on the loud side with that same group of hikers we had been trying to work around, but wanting to keep our gear dry for the trip home caused us to sleep in the shelter Vs tenting (would have preferred tenting). We walked into Mountain Harbour with Pensioner around noon on Wednesday - which left plenty of time to shower and do laundry. Mountain Harbour was a wonderful place to stay - good food, clean and well run. We will start our fall hike from there as well.
Overall this was a fantastic section hike with unique things to see along the way and a largely well graded and maintained trail. Although I have heard how great this section was from friends that have been here before me, I have to say myself that the Carolina Balds are spectacular and fall under the AT must see list. We saw all of the balds we crossed in good weather, which unto itself is amazing. The trails were are well maintained and I have to give a ""hats-off"" to the trail maintainers for the fantastic stone work in many areas along this section of trails.
We will be back this way in the fall to continue our journey north to Pearisburg VA. We have 246 miles left to finish the south which will only leave us  ~118 miles from Monson to Katahdin - the end is growing near - something I look forward to with mixed emotions.","Green Corner Road Near Standing Bear

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612541,"This is the first part of a compilation of Greenie's and my hike from Roan Mountain to Mount Rogers NRA headquarters just north of Partnership shelter near Marion VA. We started walking on Sunday 9/30 and finished the section on Friday 10/12. Distance travelled shown on this page is the total distance for this trip
Greenie and I flew out of Boston on Saturday 9/29 to Asheville, Meeting Harry Siegal who drove us to Mountain Harbour. This was the second time Harry had shuttled us, and he was on time and great to deal with providing a comfortable ride to Roan Mountain.
When we got to Mountain Harbour we collected our food drop boxes and settled in getting ready for the start of our walk. We packed up our bounce boxes to ship ahead to Marion Va where we would need our duffles and street clothes for the end of our trip.
This late in the season, the wonderful food truck was not in operation, so we had frozen pizzas for dinner and turned in at about 8:00 PM
Sunday 9/30 we were up at 6:40 (late for us) and went up to the main house for coffee and at 8:00 AM they served the most wonderful home made breakfast we had ever had. We hit the trail around 9:00 AM.
The initial climb out of Roan Mountain was moderate - and we had some beautiful open areas along the way. The trail leveled out and most of our day was in the woods. We passed a Baptist Church and a cemetery that someone had left a baby car seat (empty) at the cemetery gate (really weird). We stopped at Jones Falls for a snack (not a spot to me missed) and made our way to the Mountaineer falls shelter where we watered up and headed out. We connected at the shelter with ""Just Joe"", who joined us for the night tenting off the trail on an old forest service road before Walnut Mountain. 10.4 miles for our first day and in all, was a good one.
Monday 10/1: I guess I had some wacky dreams last night - Greenie said I was talking tongues at one point and called out my wife's name at about 1:00 AM. I woke before sunrise to the moon shining into my tent. first light at 6:50 and sunrise at about 7:20. We hit the trail at about 8:30. Lots of walking in the woods today. Just Joe shoved off ahead of us, but we did eventually catch up to him. Only had one nice vista today - otherwise just walking in the green tunnel. Made Moreland Shelter for lunch. Joe was struggling with the heat. I gave him some electrolyte tabs to help him out, but I got the feeling he was not going to continue this trip based on his condition and his demeanor. We hit one more minor view point just before we stopped for the day. We set camp near a nice open field with level tent sites and a good water source. We ended up being the only folks there for the night. 20.5 miles under our feet with tomorrow to be 12.7 miles where we would land at Boots Off Hostel for the night.
Tuesday 10/2 - up with first light, broke camp, and headed out by 8:30 just as it started to rain. It rained the first hour before the skies started to brighten. Crossed Dennis Cove Road and onto Laurel Fork Falls. Greenie got stung by a yellow jacket going down to the falls but was OK. The hike from the falls took us around a small rock outcropping which would be impassible at high water. We watered up before we crossed the river via a bridge and began a 1,700 foot climb up to pond flats  -and damn, was it hot! We hit a spring near the summit where we sat for lunch and dried out a little. On the way down we passed a flip-flop hiker slackpacking - but otherwise only saw a few hikers all day. I took a big time digger falling over the side of the trail which was edged along the steep grade. I managed to grab a small sapling to keep from sliding down the steep grade. Greenie had to pull my pack off of me first so I could get back up onto the trail. I would have been screwed had I been alone.
Boots off hostel is OK - we had a ""micro cabin"" which was really small but clean. They took us into town for dinner which was one of the most unhappy places I have been on the trail. Back at the hostel we showered (this shower should not be missed), grabbed our laundry and packed it in at 8:15.
Wednesday 10/3. Up and out by 8:30. Nice hike around Watauga Lake. Hit Wilbur Dam, took a break and some pictures and started up the Iron Mountain range. By 10:00 it was stupid hot and muggy - I had to stop and wring my shirt out I was so wet from sweat. Met up with Shoestring and Woodchuck at the spring before Vandeventer Shelter where we broke for lunch. Stopped at the shelter on the way out, took some pictures and moved on. Set camp at 3:45 and hit the hay at 7:30 (dark).
Thursday 10/4 Good day today, and just what we needed. The place where we tented had a little slope, but not bad. The folks that camped on the other side of the trail left before us and also left a campfire burning (idiots). Greenie and I snuffed it out as best we could before leaving. The trail was kinder and gentler today, and we slowed our pace to adjust to the heat. We crossed an old farm that had a handicapped accessible section of trail as well as Uncle Grindstones grave. Only a few SOBOs today. We tented at a nice grassy area above Low Gap (US 421). Tomorrow we reach Damascus and a zero day.
Friday 10/5:Up earlier than usual this AM and began packing by headlamp. Was a little ""off  balance"" this AM finding it difficult to get organized and think clearly. I did not sleep as well as I would have liked or thought I should have given the level tent site I had.On the trail before 8:30. Passed McQueens Knob shelter (only used for emergencies). The place looked like it would fall down in a light wind so I could see why you would not use it unless there was no choice. Stopped at Abbington Gap shelter and watered up as it was the last water for 8 miles. Long hike down to the water.Crossed the TN/VA line around 2:00 PM, took some pictures and walked on. Only saw a few hikers all day today.Came across a strange dude who set up ""home"" just north of the VA line - the kind of dude you need to be concerned about your safety around. We reported him to the caretaker of ""The Place"", who is also a local hiking club leader. He was going to address it with the authorities. Checked into the Hikers Inn - a fantastic place to stay. Finally, we are in Damascus!","Mountain Harbour Hostel Roan Mountain, TN
",Damascus VA,"Oct 12, Fri",138.90
Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612613,"Friday 10/5: On the way into Damascus, we stopped for pictures at the village green under the sign that you always see folks pictures of. We walked into town and as we strolled, I noted to Greenie the personalized bricks in the sidewalk. Greenie did not know it, but I had one installed for us a few years ago as a part of a fundraiser. We saw a brick for Snowfrog, who we had met in PA on his thru hike a few years ago. I commented to greenie ""you know, there is a brick here for us too"". It took a few minutes for it to register, and then he said ""really?"" as if I was kidding him. We found our brick in front of a house a short distance north after MRO's. Greenie was floored. He could not believe that I had done this for us. It was a special moment to say the least. This simple object commemorating our walk together, marking our passage on this epic footpath.
After checking in at the hostel, we went to the Damascus Diner for dinner, then back to the room for the night. Zero day tomorrow!
Saturday 10/6: Up early and downstairs for some coffee. Ran into ""Mariposa"", who was staying at the hostel as well and was the same hiker we met on our way down off of pond flats. She was packing out today so we likely would not see her again. Went to MOJO's for breakfast, then to MRO's where greenie got some new socks and I set up some slackpacking for the next day. We would get 17.1 miles in on Sunday making Monday a shorter day but with some good elevation change. Camping restrictions being lifted, we would stick with our original plan and stay at Thomas Knob in Grayson Highlands. I got to meet Bob Peoples at MRO's, someone I had always wanted to meet. 
Spoke to the owner of MRO's - guess business has been tough with his numbers down (34%) which may put him out of business after 30 years. Sad to see the internet changing the face of retail the way it has.
Hung out on the front porch of the hostel for the afternoon - tough life!
Sunday 10/7: Up before 6:00, had some coffee and went to MOJO's for breakfast at 7:00. At MRO's for 8:30 to shuttle us to Summit Cut where we would start our walk back into town. Started walking at 9:15. Made Lost Mountain shelter in no time, the place where we would have spent Sunday night had we not slackpacked. The trail today was one of the most nondescript sections of trail I have ever done. The only thing interesting was the VA creeper Trail. Took lunch at 1:30 sitting on the trail near a large stream. Got dumped on with rain for the last 3 or so miles back into town finishing our walk at about 4:30. Paul at the hostel did our laundry while we showered. Went for pizza for dinner. Met Squeeker and Bluebeard, two flip-floppers that missed the PO Saturday so had to wait until Monday to get their drop box. Tomorrow, on to Thomas Knob and Grayson Highlands.
Monday 10/8: Up before 6:00, went downstairs for coffee and then went over to the diner for breakfast. After breakfast we went back to the hostel, finished our final preparations and headed over to MRO's for our shuttle back to Summit Cut. We were at the trailhead by 9:10 and hiking shortly after. Today was a five mile long climb with a gain of almost 2,000 feet to the summit of White Top Mountain. Views would have been great, but we were in the clouds all day. Stopped for lunch at VA 600 then crossed the road into an open field and the final climb to the shelter. Reached Thomas Knob shelter at 3:15, did our chores and took a nap. A couple we passed on the way up arrived almost 2 hours after we did. There were a few other hikers there including a flip-flop couple and a dad with is son and two labs. 7:24 PM called it a day. Tomorrow we would do 12.8 miles and hopefully see some wild ponies.
Tuesday 10/9: The theme of last night was wind and rain. At times if felt like the roof would come off of the shelter. I was so glad not to be tenting and the loft of the shelter was comfortable and dry. Up at 6:30 and moving a little sluggishly. The couple we met last night came over to the shelter for breakfast - very nice people indeed. We hiked out at 8:30 AM. At Rhododendron Gap we saw our first ponies (yea!) which actually turned out to be the only ones we would see all day. Hiked in fog, clouds, wind and light rain all day so did not see a lot of Grayson Highlands. I will have to come back some day to see it in nicer weather.
Ran into three young (unprepared) backpackers before wise shelter. Guess the guys were a bit lost. Gave them some info and hiked on. Hope they made it to where they were going.
We stopped at the kiosk at the Scales to eat lunch. The kiosk gave us some relief from the wind and rain. We stood eating lunch and then hiked on. The hike to VA 603 had lots of roots and rocks, but we reached the road before 3:30. Staying at Sufi Lodge tonight - although the folks that own the place were nice enough, and the meals they prepared were good, it is not a place I would stay at again. It was one of the first places that I have stayed at on the trail that I felt like I was going to get stuck there (uncomfortable). It took days to get the smell of the place out of my gear. Feel bad for the folks running it - I tried to offer some constructive feedback but they rebuffed me. Doubt the place will make it.
Bad weather coming in between Wednesday and Thursday. Changed our plans to slack pack Wednesday and go into Marion. Will take thursday off to stay out of the weather and finish on Friday to finish the section.
Wednesday 10/10: Slackpacked all day in the rain from VA 603 to VA 16 at Dickey Gap. Folks from Sufi Lodge provided the shuttle into Marion.Thursday 10/11: Zero day at Econolodge. Did laundry, ate, slept and watched TV. Rained hard all day with bad flooding just north of us. The Roanoke River had a flash flood that did a lot of damage. Glad we were not in the woods today. Set up a shuttle with Jim Sparks to help us slackpack from VA16 Dickey Gap to the Mt Roger NRA ranger station near marion.Friday 10/12. last day on the trail today. Jim Sparks got us before 8:30. The hike from Dickey Gap to Mt Rogers headquarters too us 6 hours to cover 14 miles. The day was clear and cool and the skies were as Greenie would call them a ""bluebird"" day. Had some nice hiking along an old woods road and what looked to be part of an old railroad trestle. I thought it would be a good idea if they could turn the old rail bed into a bike path like the Virginia Creeper trail - but then perhaps not. Had the longest section of rhododendron tunnel I have ever seen for at least a mile before hitting Partnership shelter. Took some video of it to share on facebook so folks at home could see what we were seeing.Met Jim at the headquarters and he drove us into town where I picked up our rental car. Had dinner that night at the ""Wooden Pickle"" - what a really nice place and Greenie treated me to dinner to boot! What a great way to finish our hike. We fly home tomorrow and will be back in the spring to finish the last ~106 miles we have left in VA between Marion and Pearisburg. We will finish the trail in 2019, before Greenie turns 70 and while I am still 60. All that is left after VA is from Monson to Katahdin - I cannot wait! It will be good to be done.","Damascus

We have ~106 miles left to finish between Marion/Mt.Rogers NRA headquarters and Pearisburg. It seems strange that after this walk we only have the 100 mile wilderness and Katahdin to walk - this epic journey that started back in 2004 will be complete. It is not without very mixed emotions that I begin this final year hiking the AT. It has consumed a significant part of my life for over a decade. I have worked through may challenges both physical and emotional to get to this point, but  I am ready to move onto the next phase of my life and my next adventure. I reflect on what Strider said in the video Trek as he was almost done with the trail, and now good it felt to be almost done. I now know how he felt, and I am certain that those emotions will only intensify when we start that last walk in August to complete the trail.Looking forward to this walk - I have trained as hard as I have for any trek and know I am as physically ready as I can be. I hope for once that Greenie does not kick my butt.

Greenie and I flew down to Roanoke starting at separate locations with myself leaving from Boston and Greenie from Portland Maine, which is closer to his new home now Vs making the trek to Boston. My flight was late but we finally met at the Roanoke Airport, rented a car and drove down to Marion where we were to start this final walk in the south.
Wednesday Morning 5/22
Greenie and I were awake before 5:00 this morning. We went to breakfast at the Econonlodge where we were staying and met a NOBO hiker by the name of Chug. We had to get to the post office early this first morning to mail our bounce box to Woods Hole where we would finish the trail and gave Chug a ride there as well as she also had to mail something.
After the PO run we dropped Chug back to the hotel and continued on to US 11 and the Barn parking lot where we were to meet Jim Sparks who would drive us back to the Mt. Rogers Headquarters where we would start this walk. Jim was early as usual to provide our ride. We also stopped into the Barn restaurant and made a donation for leaving our car in their lot. The new owners don't charge to leave your car there like the previous owners, but we felt it good Ju-Ju to make the gesture.
We started walking at 10:00 at Mt Rogers heading NOBO. We made the Chatfield shelter around 1:00 to find a crew from Inside Edition there doing a story about Stronghold and how the hiking community felt about the safety on the trail at this point in time.
later, we stopped by the Homesteader School house for some trail magic in the form of cold soda and fruit before hiking onto our car at the Barn. We finished about 3:30 and headed back to Marion. Tomorrow we meet Jim Sparks at 8:00/8:30 at the car rental place where he will then take us back to the Barn parking lot where we will start day two.
Sighting of the day today was a rose breasted Grossbeak.
Thursday 5/23
Passing through the area where Stronghold was murdered.

Today was going to be a somber day as we were passing through the area where the recent incident happened on the AT. Jim met us at Enterprise rental, early as usual, and dropped us off at the Barn Shortly after 8:30. We were walking before 8:45 AM. We passed a woman hiker after about a mile and then another young woman packing up camp after a few miles in. Lots of open fields this morning and with the heat building so when we finally got into the woods the coolness was nice.
We took a quick break about 10:30 and only stopped briefly around noon to get some water. There was a group at the water source, so we just pushed on. Some British guy was jogging with a full pack and the young woman that we had passed breaking camp caught up to us and eventually went on ahead.
We could not help to think about Stronghold and what happened in this section. I kept wondering, what would I do given the same set of circumstances. It seemed there were lots of places to get off the trail to get away and hide, but that is easy to conjecture about when it is daytime (Vs nighttime) and you are not in that kind of situation.
We made it to the Quarterway Inn before 1:00 PM and had lunch. Tina passed us on the way out and gave us the quick run-thru when she got back. Odie was here (AT yearbook fame) who we had met yesterday with the Inside Edition crew.
We got cleaned up and had Pizza and Ice cream for dinner along with picking up a couple of fuel canisters from Tina's gear shop at the Inn. Coffee is at 6:15 in the morning and breakfast is at 7:00. This is a really NICE place to stay!
Sightings today: 2 deer, red winged black birds, Swallows and the brightest Oriole I have ever seen in my life.
Friday 5/24/19Up at 6:00 AM this morning, washed and went downstairs for coffee. We had a wonderful home made breakfast - one of the best I have had on the trail. After breakfast we packed, squared off with Tina and headed out before 8:00 AM.We had the initial road walk to the trail, and then traversed open fields for a while before entering the woods. The view back to where we had come from just before entering the woods was pastoral. The trail for the initial part of our day was gentle and rolling until the climb up Brushy Mountain where we worked up a good sweat in the morning heat. At Knot Maul Branch shelter, Chug and another hiker caught up with us. We moved onto Lick Creek reaching the shelter around noon and stopped for lunch. Lick Creek was to have been our finish point for the day but it was too early to stop so we pushed onto Chestnut Knob Shelter another six miles out.The climb up to Chestnut ridge was long and hot, but not as bad as it could have been. We met two section hikers from the west coast, one of whom was originally from Shrewsbury Mass, the next town over from where Greenie and I live. Chestnut ridge was open and beautiful with lots of blackberries growing up top. We stopped for water before the shelter, and made camp just beyond it.Master, who was at the hostel joined us as did one other hiker who had only stopped at the hostel and moved on the day prior.14 miles today and 5,449 feet in elevation change. I also was able to connect with Bubba for our shuttle on Sunday/Monday to and from Bland.Good Day today but no major sightings. Did see a Rufous Sided Towhee, a Cardinal and lots of cows!Saturday 5/25/1910.7 miles planned today and 2,659 feet in elevation change - - and hot as all get out!Started this morning at 5:45 AM, made coffee and broke camp. Master left just ahead of us as there was to be trail magic in the form of a hillbilly hiker feed at Walker Gap 1.4 miles away.We headed down and joined him. Met Rabbit (she) who is doing her second thru-hike. We had all kinds of fruit, veggies, home made chilli, potato salad, hot dogs, deserts and sodas. The three guys that put on the feed have done so for about 12 years. They even had post cards for the hikers to send home (the wife of one of the guys is the local postmaster).Today was not too difficult elevation wise, but was largely down hill and hard on the knees.We stopped at VA 632, called home, and hiked on.We passed the side trail to the Davis Farm Campsite where we would have spent tonight had we not gone longer yesterday and kept hiking to Jenkins shelter, arriving around 1:00 PM, where we are now. Shepherd, who we met a few times over yesterday and tented near us last night came in after us. He was suffering from shin splints. I hope he takes a break and lets them heal or he is going to get knocked off of the trail.We had lunch at the shelter and set camp. Washing up at the stream and resting with the heat today is a must for me. I did not see the point of pushing on another 4.4 miles today to the next camping spot when the heat was so bad and I was fairly spent. Tomorrow is about 11 miles and about the same in elevation change, but our destination is Bland to resupply, shower and do laundry. Our shuttle is not until 3:00 PM so we will have plenty of time and if possible, take a swim if we find a good spot.Sighting today was lady slippers.Sunday May 26, 2019Had some light showers last night just after dark. We heard some thunder off in the distance so I closed down the awning on my tent putting it into storm mode. We had a bear in camp last night, but he did not bother anyone.Up with first light and began packing up. We hit the trail around 7:15 AMToday the heat and humidity was much less than yesterday, so we made a good pace. We had a nice and easy old woods road walk for a distance and reached Laurel Creek in no time (4.3 miles). We stopped to stretch and water up as this was the last water for the day.We ran into '59 Olds, Huck and Shepherd among others still in camp who had tented near the creek. The trail was kinder today and with the comfortable breeze and lower temps we made US 52 by noon. We called Bubba who picked us up 20 minutes later and had us at the Big Walker Motel 20 minutes later. We grabbed our supply drop boxes in the lobby and were in our room by 12:30. Greenie and I showered and then Greenie walked over to the Circle K for been and snacks. We had dinner at the Subway down the road and then stopped over to the Dairy Queen at the Circle K where Greenie got some ice cream. Bubba will take us back to the trail around 8:00 AM Monday morning when we will start the second half of this hike and the completion of Virginia.","Marion VA

Greenie and I were up at 6:00 this morning. We made coffee and breakfast in the room. I also grabbed a quick shower - - because I could.
Bubba picked us up at 8:00 but while we were waiting for him we had a chance to talk to a couple who were going up to the trail to do some trail magic. Apparently the woman had done some of the trail but while she would have liked to thru-hike it, it never happened. The friend she had hiked with now had cancer - so it will likely never happen.
We were on the trail around 8:15 or so after a photo opp with the couple from the motel. She wanted a photo with ""real hikers""...so I guess we qualify.
Today was mostly in the woods. We stopped and spoke to a couple of hikers at the 600 mile north of springer mark. They asked us to take a picture of them. One of the hikers was recently retired from SAP. Oddly enough, we ran into a young man on the trail today who was pumped as he had just found out (on the trail) that he had been hired for his first job after college.
We stopped at the Jenny Knob Shelter for water and then hiked on one more mile to where we will camp for the night (0.2 miles south of VA 608).
It looks like we will be the only two camping here for the night as most would either stop at the Jenny Knob Shelter or keep going.
Tomorrow is our big day, 17.9 miles.
Sighting today was a Goshawk near our campsite
Tuesday 5/28/2019
Up this morning at 5:50 AM, broke camp and was walking by 7:15. Crossed VA 608 in short order and began our larger climb for the day up Brushy Mountain. We crossed through some fields at the end of Brushy Mountain and then over a really neat suspension bridge that spanned Kimberling Creek.
The trail was largely flat so we made good time reaching our  originally planned destination near a crossing of Dismal Creek at about 12:30. WE had lunch and pushed on another 2.2 miles to Wapiti Shelter.
Along the way we saw a pileated woodpecker (I mistook his call last night for a Goshawk) and also saw a young deer
The shelter has some nice tenting areas and a great stream nearby. Someone had created a deep pool in the stream by stacking rocks - so we had a great place to bathe and clean up. Washing up in the stream felt really sweet!
A hiker here from Japan and as it turns out, had lost his water filter a few days ago. Greenie gave him some extra Aquamira drops he had in his pack that would hold the guy until he got to town to purchase a new filter. The guy was beyond himself with gratitude, so after Greenie refusing money for the drops the guy gave him some origami birds he was carrying with him as gift.
Going further today only leaves us 8.2 miles to Woods Hole tomorrow, so we should be done by noon at the latest. In all today was a great day. I cannot believe that this is our last night camping on the trail in VA and only have two days left to finish the south. After this it will be off to Maine to finish the 100 mile wilderness, climb Mount katahdin and complete the entire AT.
One downer of a note today - my shorts snap broke so I am going to have to wear my sleeping shorts the balance of this hike.
Wednesday May 29, 2019
The days are obviously getting longer as first night had me moving at 5:40 Vs 5:50 AM. We broke camp and ate breakfast at the shelter. ""Just John"" joined us at the shelter. Our Japanese friend had hit the privy and disappeared without saying goodbye.
We started with a climb today of about 1,170 feet. Once we reached the ridge it was fairly easy hiking. We stopped at some of the viewpoints including the summit of Sugar Run Mountain. We arrived at Woods Hole by 11:30, got showered and got our laundry going. Our shuttle to take us to get our rental car showed up prior to 2:00. After getting the rental we stopped at the Food Lion to get some happy hour and lunch food. We got back to Woods Hole before a thunderstorm started coming in hard core.
Tomorrow will be 16 miles and we have to be done by 4:00 to meet Don (AKA Ratface) our shuttle so we can get back to the hostel as we will be going into town for dinner and we are helping provide transportation to other hikers. Tonight dinner is at the hostel. Tomorrow will be Korean BBQ.
One point to note: Two small canisters of gas got us through 4 nights on the trail plus breakfast in Bland. Greenies canister died this AM but mine still had enough to get us through breakfast this morning.
Thursday May 30, 2019

Last day in Virginia! Greenie was up at 5:00, but I slept until 6:00. We had coffee and a trail breakfast and pushed off at 7:00 walking back up to the AT. We hit the AT at 7:10 and finding the treadway fairly easy we put down a good pace averaging 2.7 MPH. We stopped at an overlook, took in the view and moved on. We took a quick look at Doc's knob shelter, which had a really nice deck out front, and hiked on.
We stopped at a rock ledge overlook to view the valley below and also stopped at a powerline cut to take in the view and call home.
Before Angels Rest Overlook we ran into ""Just John"" again while he was taking a break. We talked to him for a while. Another hiker we had seen on the trail a few times showed up as well.
We pushed onto Angel Rest and called Don (Ratface) to move our pick-up time up to 2:30 from 4:00 We then started our downward climb, passing an old defunct power line tower now surrounded by the forest. We crossed Cross Ave and stopped for water at a small waterfall taking some pictures before moving on. We stopped at the parking lot near the Pearis Cemetery to have lunch. We received some trail magic from a driver from Angels Rest Hostel who stopped and gave us some cold sodas! While having lunch ""Just John"" showed up. We talked , took some pictures of the three of us and moved on.
When we crossed the bridge over the New River we met up with a few thru-hikers we had seen over the last several days - spoke briefly - and moved on. Passing a manufacturing facility and a landfill, the air smelled nasty. Two young hikers we had passed, passed us. Greenie took off like a shot to keep up with them. Greenie was also farting up a storm today....as in all day....payback for all of my indiscretions in terms of letting my gas pass.
We finished VA at 2:00 PM. 16 miles today in just over 6 hours.

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620804,"I wanted to put up a post regarding Greenie's and my last AT section hike which we will start next week. We will walk from Monson to Katahdin over several days, the final chapter in my 15 year, and Greenie's 20 year AT adventure.
This has been an amazing adventure, and while I cannot believe that it is almost over, I am oddly ready for it to be over. The commitment to constant training, sacrifice by my wife and family while I spend up to four weeks a year hiking the trail as been a lot for both me and them. It is time to give a little back to those that have sacrificed so I could follow my dream.
For all of the friends I have met along the way, thank you for being a part of my walk. Without everyone I have met on the trail this walk would have had far less meaning. Folks I have met along the way like Cimarron, Stumpknocker, Mrs. Gorp, Rocky and Swampfox, Waterboy, Road runner, NedtheFed, Yogi, Haystack, Dink, Darth and Dog Whisperer and Snow Frog to name a few have all been a part of this adventure. At first my family had thought I had lost my mind when mentioning different trail names, but it has become as much a part of my families culture has it has been a part of the culture of the trail.

So this is the final chapter of my 15 year section hike of the AT. Greenie and I plan to walk from Monson to Baxter State Park where we will be joined by family in Millinocket to do the final hike up Katahdin. 
I drove up to Monson and met Greenie at Shaws where we would spend our first night. We had a small section from the Blue Blazed trail to Lake Hebron to Maine 15 to knock off before entering the 100 Mile Wilderness, so we got that out of the way the day we arrived in Monson. It was a short walk, but nice to have finished off before our long walk this trip.
Back at Shaws, we hung out a while outside talking with the other hikers, then went for dinner at the General store as all of the other places in the area were closed on Monday night. Tomorrow we are up and out with breakfast at 7:45, but coffee is ready at 7:00.
Tuesday 8/13/19
I woke at 12:15 AM as the alarm on my phone went off. I got up and shut my phone off and went back to bed. All I did was toss and turn and when I did sleep, had vivid and un-restful dreams. I emailed our friend that would meet us at the halfway point to resupply and get a break from the trail in order to set up a fail safe meeting time and confirm that he had our drop boxes. I kept thinking about our trip details hoping that I did not leave anything out.
Greenie and I were awake at 5:15, but hung out in bed since coffee would not be ready until 6:00. I grabbed a shower before breakfast and we had a wonderful meal prepared for us at 7:00. We paid up and were shuttled to the trail head around 8:00 arriving at the trail head by 8:30. Poet, who owns the hostel with Hippie Chick, drove us and recited some really nice poetry on the ride as well as gave us some really great intel on what was ahead of us. In particular he mentioned the Antlers tent site as one of the most beautiful areas to tent on the trail. We had in our plans to stop there which was great news.
Greenie and I did not see any of the others shuttled with us until we were in camp at the Wilson Valley Lean-to when Stray Cat (Meowed) as she past by the shelter. We had looked for tenting options down by the Big Wilson Stream, but did not like anything we saw so we ended up at the shelter. Tenting locations were not great, but they worked for one night. ""John"" is here at the shelter spending the night. He is my age being born exactly one month before me. We saw lots of ponds along the way today. We stopped at Little Wilson Falls for lunch and then washed off at Big Wilson Stream. In all a great first day on the trail. No rain, some sun and the bugs were not too bad. Our drop boxes arrival was confirmed and we set a fail safe pick-up time on Friday at 4:00 PM. Poet also told us we should get cell service at the summit of White Cap Mountain just before our connection at West Branch Pond Road. I almost fell today but bent my left pole slightly instead of hitting the ground - so much for new poles!
Wednesday 8/14/19
Not a bad sleep last night at all. Up at 5:15 AM and on the trail by 7:00. First part of the day was not too bad but had a long down with lots of rocks from slides. Was able to rock hop Wilber Brook and the same with Vaughn Stream. Came across a couple buckets of trail magic from ""Bonnie"" - did not take anything but we signed her guest book and thanked her for her thoughtfulness.
Had to ford long pond stream. After getting across a (younger) NOBO hiker rock hopped it like it was nothing - Oh to be young.
Passed Slugundy gorge and falls and stopped at Long Pond Shelter to get some water. The stream was dry so I had to hike back to Slugundy falls to get water. Sucks that I had to hike it two times.
The climb up Barren slide and ledges was tough with lots of big rocks and fairly steep - but the hike to the ledges was well worth it. Greenie and I stopped for lunch and had the ledges to ourselves to enjoy the views, warm breeze and soaring turkey vultures. We made our way over to Barren Mountain - passed an older woman with a flip-flopper and her daughter. The older lady will finish the AT after 19 years of section hiking when she gets to Monson. Took a break on the summit of Barren Mountain, and then made our way over to Cloud Pond lean-to where we would end our day. Ran into Stray Cat coming up from the shelter after collecting water as well as one other hiker on his way out. We set camp near the pond. We had the chance to wash up and take a nap this afternoon. I as a little dehydrated so I drank extra water after getting into camp. It looks like we will have the area to ourselves tonight. Tomorrow is going to be a tough day - 17 miles and ~5,000 feet in elevation change. I had to re-glue the toes of my shoes tonight as they were peeling off and I am worried that they will peel back all the way if I am not careful. I hope they hold up!

Shoe breakdown on the trail
Thursday 8/15/19
Up at 5:00AM and moving at 5:10AM. I had my tent down, was partially packed and was taking the food bags down before Greenie was even moving. Nice breakfast by the pond and started walking at 6:50AM.
It was a very climbing day. First Fourth Mountain followed by Third Mountain Followed by Columbus Mountain and the Chairback Mountain. had a nice walk along the escarpment on Columbus Mtn. Broke for lunch at Chairback Gap Lean-to. Met ""Mr Tea"" and 2 NOBOs hiking together around columbus Mtn. One of the NOBOs somehow did a loop and ended coming back SOBO. His first comment when he saw us again was ""Oh Shit, how the hell did I do that?"" when we got further north we saw where he went awry due to a reroute.
Had a nice section of open ledges along the north side of Chairback. Long Pond kept constant vigil along the way.
Crossed Katahdin Iron Works road and the trail finally became easier. At the crossing the west branch of the Pleasant River we took a break, washed up a bit to clear the salt off of our skim and cool our feet. It was about 3:00 and we still had five miles to go. The trail was kinder and we made camp around 5:30/6:00. Found a great camping spot and set about getting camp set to try to be done before dark. I was spent to say the least. We finished hanging our food with the last light of the day with the use of Greenie's throwing arm which was spot on and the throws were not easy at all.
I climbed into my tent at dark and actually had to use my headlamp for the first time in years. I was concerned that my hernia repair was having issues - so I checked myself out to find all seemed OK - I was just beat up and sore all over.
Friday 8/16/19
Awake at 5:00  and called out to Greenie to see if he was awake. I started moving at 5:20 and Greenie started moving at 5:30. I started to dress but found my shorts were still soaked from yesterday and had chafed my groin area badly so I am going to hike in my sleeping shorts today so I can at least start ""dry"". We were able to break camp just as it started to rain. We met up with Mr. Tea just after the shelter who was putting on his rain gear. We stopped and did the same.
Today we do climbs over Gulf Hagas Mtn, West Peak, Hay Mtn and finally White Cap Mtn. It rained almost the entire way up and past White Cap. At times it felt like we would climb above the weather but when we reached the summit it was plain brutal! We got a call out to our ride who was going to meet us at the road crossing below White Cap Mtn but could only leave a message. I was able to email our ride and then got a text out to my wife to coordinate an earlier pick-up on our behalf.. Mr Tea hit the summit just as we were heading on. The weather today was among the worse Greenie and I have seen since we met on the trail years ago.
As we made our way down the weather started to break. We passed Logan Brook Lean-to where a couple had taken refuge for the day and also crossed paths with a woman who was finishing a 19 year section hike whom we had crossed paths with several times thus far on this hike.
We hit West Branch Pond Road earlier than expected, turned west and headed toward the gate where we would connect with Greenies friend who would let us stay in his cabin along with providing a shower, laundry and a home cooked dinner. The break we would have for the rest of the day, night and tomorrow morning would position us to finish the balance of the 100 mile wilderness and trail.","Monson

Having a near'o on Friday was a blessing allowing us to rest our bodies, minds and souls. We had time to clean-up, stock-up and rest-up. There is nothing more satisfying than taking a (clean) nap after a long hike.
Greenie and I were up early looking for coffee over at the kitchen at Eric's place, then back to our cabin to pack and prepare for the day prior to heading back over to the kitchen to get breakfast. Another guest offered to give us a ride back to the trail, which was greatly appreciated. We made a trail lunch prior to leaving the kitchen and then headed back to the cabin to collect our stuff and head out.
The trail to start was nice and easy, and we made our ""10 by 12:00"" reaching the Cooper Brook Falls lean-to by noon. Our goal was the Antlers Campsite, which Poet had told us was one of the nicest campsites in the wilderness. We pulled into camp later than we had hoped, and with camp chores to do there was no time to take a swim. Our first attempt at putting up our bear bag line was too low, so we had to move to another location in the campsite. Many of the trees had limbs higher up and not any lower limbs, so we ended up using ""nubs"" on the trees and gained a mechanical advantage pulling the line around the trees in such a way as to put the force against the side of the tree. Our food would be safe for the night. After having dinner and cleaning up, we hung our food for the night and went to bed.
Sunday 8/18/2019
It rained last night and I found that my recent attempt at seam sealing had some ""flaws"". User error.....I had some minor drips overnight, just enough to be aggravating. We broke down camp and had our breakfast over at a makeshift table between two trees near the lake. After which we made our final preparation to hit the trail. My morning homage to the potty gods was fun as the privy was somewhat hard to find and when I did find it, the door had been partially ripped off of the front - likely from a bear.
We hit the trail and stopped at a gravel logging road where the sun was attempting to make an appearance and provided an opportunity to try to dry our gear. We at berries near the trail while we waited for our gear to dry although the best we would get was partially dry.
We passed some SOBO hikers that had stayed at White House Landing last night. The trail based on the elevation profile should have been easy, but we had to navigate a spider-web of roots for a long section running parallel to the Nahmakanta Stream. The combination of the heat and humidity and the extended need to concentrate on the treadway was exhausting. When we reached a gravel road near the south end of Nahmakanta Lake we stopped to fully dry our gear and have lunch. The parking area near the road looked more like a hikers yard sale with our stuff all spread out. Some folks driving by offered Greenie a beer, which he gratefully accepted. When I asked it they by chance had a coke/soda for the ""non-drinker with a hiking problem"" they responded that they did not, but offered me a carrot instead (I am not making this up!). I thanked them for their generosity but declined.
When we finally packed and got on our way again the heat and the mental stress from the difficult treadway was finally getting to me, and as we approached an area just south of the Wadleigh Stream lean-to I announced I had enough and that we were going to stop for the day and add our miles from today to tomorrow. We found a wonderful place to set camp on the shore of the lake complete with a picnic table. First order of business was a swim, followed by setting camp and putting up a bear bag line. Pleased with our decision to stop and smell the roses, we bunked down for the night with the sound of the water lapping the shore.
Monday 8/19/2019
We were up early and thankful for no rain last night, but it was still cloudy out and we had yet to so much as catch a glimpse of Katahdin during the entire trip thus far. We broke camp and headed north. Our first climb today was Nesuntabunt Mountain. The trail passed through some unusual gorges enroute to the summit. There were no views today at the summit as we were in the clouds again. We stopped for a brief break, and headed on.
We passed Pollywog gorge and crossed Pollywog stream via a logging road bridge. We were thankful that we had opted to camp at the lake last night Vs where we had originally planned to camp near the logging road. Short of Rainbow stream lean-to I stopped to wring my socks out and dry my feet a bit before heading on. We bypassed the shelter even though it was noon as we were not all that hungry yet and the shelter was busy with hikers.
Shortly after passing the shelter - disaster struck. I was talking to greenie and glanced back behind me briefly as I was talking and all of a sudden pitched forward and fell on my right side in a mud slough. The impact was sudden and abrupt and when I hit the ground, my pole wrist strap jerked my right wrist in such a way that I immediately knew I had broken it. Greenie tried to convince me that I had merely sprained it, but I knew that bones were not meant to move in the way they did when I hit the ground. I got up and tried to brush the yutz off of me as best I could, and then walked a short distance back to the lake to wash the mud off and collect my wits.
When I rejoined Greenie it was clear that our hike was over. The goal now was to treat my injury and get to medical assistance. After splinting my arm we discerned that the best direction was to continue north. By my research I knew that our next chance for cell service was at Rainbow Ledges and if that failed, we would surely find assistance at Abol Bridge with a campground and camp store located there.
We pressed on as it started to rain lightly and we could hear thunder in the distance. The weather did fortunately hold for the most part. We passed a few SOBO hikers and a Maine guide with some clients heading out fishing but did not find any assistance until we finally reached the ledges shortly after 5:00. We called 911 who put us in touch with one of the Maine Rangers by the name of Andy Glidden. Ranger Glidden instructed us to hike to Hurd Brook where he would come in on a side trail to meet us and take us out to his truck a shorter way than hiking the AT to Abol Bridge. I have to be honest that Greenie and I were disappointed that we would not reach Abol Bridge which would be a far easier place to pick up from - but the rangers assistance was greatly appreciated and we knew that logically this was the best course of action.
When we reached Hurd Brook lean-to we called the ranger from the hill behind the shelter - where he told us that we would find cell coverage. He was surprised that we had reached the shelter so quickly, but would meet us shortly as he was well on his way.
Ranger Glidden guided us out via a side trail to his truck and drove us into Millinocket. We had to hike the last mile or so out using our headlamps. In all we hiked 23 miles that day, 13 of which with my arm in a splint and sling. Over the afternoon I monitored the circulation and sensation at my fingers - which all fortunately were fine. Had they not have been our situation would have been seriously more dire.
Once at the regional hospital x rays confirmed what I knew all along - I had indeed fractured my right radius at the wrist. Our trip was officially over. My Son Alex and his wife who were already in town and had planned to hike the final climb with us, picked us up at  the hospital and took  us to a hotel where we would spend the night as the AT Lodge did not have any room that night. Where we stayed was a dump - but with being so tired we ate dinner from our food bags, cleaned up and bedded down for the night.

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630007,"So when all was said and done, I had fractured the bone at the joint in my right radius. The break required surgery (seems like I am forever being cut open for something). The doctor gave me the choice of a full arm cast for four weeks and then a partial cast for another two or so weeks and then the long road of PT to gain use of my arm again - that or do surgery ASAP and start PT in a few days later. I took the surgery route knowing that recovering full use of my arm would be difficult going the cast route - and there was no guarantee the bone would remain non-displaced which could mean further challenges later on.
Greenie and I would come back in 2020 and finish the trail - not knowing at that time that our country would be in the middle of a pandemic by early in 2020. Greenie would have been section hiking the trail for 20 years at that point and I 16 years. But we would finish and finish in style.

Kind of sounds like the beginning of a bad joke but here it is, big as life. Planning this final trip was more difficult than any other I have had to plan. Too many uncertainties, too many changes happening beyond my control and navigating Baxter State Parks reservation process is no picnic either.
I had made reservations at the NEOC back in the fall, well before any of us even heard of COVID. When the pandemic hit, I had no idea if we could even go to Maine or not. I pulled together a plan ""B"" and ""C"" (which consisted of being dropped off via float plane on Rainbow Lake and hiking NOBO) as usual, but plan ""A"" was to stay at the NEOC and day hike the balance of the AT, which would be far easier to include family in the completion of the trail.

Greenie and I got on-line exactly 14 days to the minute prior to our arrival dates to get our parking permits for Baxter State Park. We hit their reservation site at midnight and had our permits by 12:05 AM. ALL of the permits were GONE by 12:07 AM! If we had not done so, completing the final walk would have required more (difficult) adjustments to work around the logistical challenges of not being able to drive ourselves into the park.
As things turned out, Greenie and I were able to include some members of our families and Wingman in the final walk. We all had to figure out how to get Covid tested and be in Maine within 72 hours of our tests. My son Alex and his wife being from NY did not need to be tested as well as Greenie being from NH, but we all felt it in the best interest of the group to be safe and get it done - and found a way to do so. While a test was not a guarantee of safety, it was about as close as you could get to being risk-free so we could all be around each other Vs acting as we all had the virus.
It was a six hour drive to Maine, and to my amazement the folks up in Millinocket did NOT wear masks in spite of a state mandate and the need for folks from out of state to be tested and comply with Maines COVID executive orders. I found this very sad and honestly insulting. We had to keep them safe, but they don't give a crap about us. I will let it go at that.

The NEOC was a wonderful place to stay, and the folks there were compliant to state mandates and ran a safe and clean operation. I will gladly go there again someday.
We all arrived at about the same time late in the afternoon and had an enjoyable evening with a magnificent sunset to boot. Tomorrow we begin the final walk. I cannot believe it is finally here - I just have to stay injury free!","Home

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630242,"Greenie, Wingman and I were up and out early. We had to take two cars to Abol Bridge so we could leave one overnight to drive home from our section hike tomorrow from Katahdin Stream. Greenie followed in his car and ate the dust of my car as we drove down the Golden Road to the parking area near Abol Bridge. This was one place where we did not need parking permits as it is just outside of Baxter State Park.
After parking the cars we began our hike SOBO back to Hurd Brook Shelter where Greenie and I got off the trail in tow of the ranger last year. As always it feels so good to be following the white blazes. Greenie and I always say that following the White Blazes is like coming home.
Crossing Abol Bridge, we turned into the woods heading south. The trail was easy and the temps were comfortable. In addition, the bugs were not too bad which was nice. We stopped at the trail register, recorded our passing and hiked on. This was a nice place to start - 12 miles out and back over a fairly easy treadway. Lots of pine trees, red squirrels and moss. We only passed a few hikers going NOBO but did not speak to anyone until we reached the shelter. There were two NOBO thru-hikers there trying to figure out their next steps as they needed food and did not have reservations in Baxter to camp. We spoke to them a short while, and they left just prior to us.
It was strange passing the partially blocked side trail that we had taken out the night I broke my wrist. 
Our stop a the shelter was short, and we were on our way back to Abol Bridge with the intent of being done by no later than noon. as it ended up we finished at about 11:00 and for some reason the hike back felt shorter than the hike in.
We did pass a few SOBO hikers along the way, but that was it.
We stopped at Abol Bridge to take a couple of photos and had to walk on the Car Vs pedestrian part of the bridge to maintain social distancing from some folks on the bridge.
 As we neared the point where we had to get off of the Golden Road, we spotted my son Alex out for a long run. We slowed to say hello and met him back at the house not too long after we pulled in.
We were back at the NEOC by noon. Day one in the books, and a wonderful one at that!","Abol Bridge

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630384,"We were all up early as you have to get to Baxter State Park well before 7:00 or they give your parking pass away by 7:05 AM. We left the NEOC well before 6:00 and were at the park gate at about 6:05 AM gaining entrance without issue.
Alex and Alice drove with us and were going to hike from Katahdin Stream  and bring the car back to the NEOC for us while Greenie, Wingman and I hiked SOBO back to Abol Bridge where we had left Greenies car the day before. We stopped at the trail register and signed in and walked on.
The trail was kind and gentle and largely a long easy downhill walk the entire way. It was cool how the park left canoes at some of the ponds along the way for folks to use. Had we felt like taking a detour we could have partaken, but we were more focused on the hike and surroundings to stop.
We passed near Daicey Pond campground and it looked like folks could rent cabins in the area - would be nice if I ever come back this way to partake.
We stopped at Big and little Niagra Falls to take in the view and take some pictures.
Near Pine Point we stopped and took in a location where my son Alex had taken a swim the time he had hiked through here with some friends when he was a senior in High School. It was cool to see the place he had enjoyed all those years ago. All day we only passed a few hikers including a thru hiking couple going NOBO and a family that was renting a cabin near ours at the NEOC. Otherwise we had the trail to ourselves all day.
We passed through a burned out section from a fire that had happened earlier this year. We also had a large owl fly up the trail ahead of us and then double back to a spot just behind us. We took a few pictures and moved on.
We crossed Foss and Knowlton Brook by fording it as the bridge had been severely damaged in a fire. I crossed first as I had my crocs and then tossed them back to Wingman since he did not have his with him.
We finished our ""10 by 12"" walking off the trail to Greenies car at noon straight up. We dropped our packs and headed over to the camp store to get a celebratory ice cream (Greenies Treat!). 
After finishing our ice cream we got into Greenies car and headed back to the NEOC to have lunch, clean up, take a swim and a nap.

Day two is in the books. One last day to finish the trail and it is going to be magnificent!","Katahdin Stream Campground

Pilot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633957,"So I have been putting off writing this last journal entry as it would mean that my section hike of the entire AT had finally come to a close. While Greenies and my hike was finished last August the adventure remains fresh in my mind and will always be a part of who I am. When I got back from our trip I immediately drafted my 2000 mile application to the ATC, only to find out after following up with them that they are not recognizing any miles completed in 2020 due to the pandemic. We finished our hike observing all of the requirements put forth by the state of Maine (testing etc) and the trail itself in the State and Baxter State Park was open to folks from outside of Maine, so what we did was fully legal and completely within guidelines to be COVID safe. We would have not gone if we could not have completed it within legal mandates.  Needless to say the ATC put a little tarnish on our completing the AT after 16 years for me and 20 years for Greenie. Oddly enough, they have no problem asking for money just about every week. 
The reply to me from the ATC was to go back and do the miles at a later date - seems that they just don't get that for someone younger that would be easier to do than for folks like me at 62 and Greenie at 70. I/we fought hard to finish the trail. I personally overcame alcohol addiction (sober since 2005), lacerated cornea (trail injury), surgery to reattach my right hamstring, broken ankle, broken big toe, broken wrist (trail injury), hernia surgery (trail injury) and congestive heart failure......Hell, the fact that I finished the trail is a damn miracle and a testament to my tenacity. 
ALDHA and the hiker yearbook had no issue recognizing our accomplishment, for which I will always be eternally grateful.
So onto our last day on the AT!
We were up early as usual going about getting ready for the trail. After breakfast, Greene, Nate, Alex, Wingman and I piled into Greenies car for the ride to Baxter State park from the NEOC. There was a sense of anticipation about the day and both excitement and anticipation among all in the car. 
My son Alex had started me on this adventure many years before, and Wingman, very much like a brother to me, had joined me on a number of sections before Greenie and I connected and decided to finish the trail together. Nate was there for his father Greenie to share in this final walk to complete his dream that started out as a mid-life crisis when he turned 50. Things could not have been more perfect.
After getting past the entrance gate we drove up to Katahdin Stream Campground where we parked our car and went about final preparation to start our hike. A ranger there spoke to us and some other hikers about safety and turn around times along with asking about gear we had with us. Even though this was a day hike, I never walk into the woods thinking I will come out the same day and always carry the essentials necessary in the event I have to hunker down for the night or deal with an emergency.
We started our ascent which started off nice and easy, but as with all big climbs the difficulty increased as the views got better. We stopped a few times for pictures before breaking the tree line. The Katahdin Stream waterfalls were very beautiful and the stopping point for folks looking for a lower level experience. After clearing the tree line the views were spectacular. The trail got more and more difficult as it dipped down along a narrow passage before climbing through large rock slabs and emerging into some difficult hand and foot climbing that was almost technical. I as watching for where Ned the Fed had his foot crushed by a dislodged boulder that required him being airlifted off of the mountain. He asked me to kick the boulder for him and If I could have clearly identified it I would have.
I thought of my good friend Cimarron and how  he and Bearbag had tried to take on this section of trail when Cimarron was trying to become the oldest hiker to thru hike the AT. His attempt was thwarted by the raw difficulty of this section of trail. At Cimarron's funeral bearbag told about how they realized it was not going to happen and ended up stopping somewhere before the big boulder scramble before reaching the Tablelands. They sat on a rock to take in the view and think about what was not to be. I carried Cimarrons red bandana with me on this hike and will wear it for him at the summit.
The boulder scramble up to the Tablelands is one for the records. At one point I felt the hand of Alex on my backside giving me a shove up a particularly difficult section where rebar was planted in the rock to get up and over boulders where no hand or footholds could be found. When we reached the Tablelands we stopped for a photo op and then walked on. Distance is always difficult to judge in such large open expanses. I was hoping to collect some water at Thoreau Springs, but opted to continue with what I had as I was not in dire need and the source there was questionable (in terms of volume).
As we made our way up to the summit, it seemed further away than it was - and then all of a sudden someone called out that they could see the sign at the summit and that it was not far. Greenie and I began to get choked up, and avoided talking to each other as not to start crying. I dropped my pack and took out Cimarrons red bandana and my fathers wings (he was a captain for Delta Airlines for over 30 years) and put them on to wear on my final steps to the summit. Again, I almost hesitated to complete those final steps as it would mean that this was over. Greenie and I approached the sign from opposite sides, and after all these years and miles, placed our hands on the finish point of our walk. It still makes me cry to think about it never mind write about it.
At 12:00 noon on August 6, 2020 Dave ""Greenie"" Greenslit and Dana ""Pilot"" Perry finished the entire Appalachian Trail.
After taking pictures, exchanging hugs and celebrating our completion, we stepped off of the summit into a low point where we could get out of the wind and have lunch. The view was spectacular with chimney pond below us and Pamola stretching off to our right. We had cell service so I was able to post pictures on facebook and call my wife to let her know we had done it.
I will not cover the trip down, but I will tell you that as hard as it was to get up to the summit, it was more nasty coming down. I was happy when we finally got to the lower section where the trail was kind and gentle. I was tempted to run the final part of the trail but restrained myself from doing so. The drive back to the NEOC was quiet as we all reflected on the day and what we had accomplished. I was happy and sad but content.
To those that consider taking on the trail, just don't think or dream about it, do it. Tell others that you are going to do it to bind yourself to the adventure. The trail will change you in a way that you cannot imagine or in ways that I can explain. My adventure started because I liked backpacking and wanted to do more, but what it became was so much more than camping and backpacking. I am a better person for having done it. If the world was like the trail, we would not have the issues we have today - I will let it go at that.

See ya down the trail!","Katahdin stream Campground
