I'm from Canada, living  in a small town outside Saint John,NB.
I've often dreamed about hiking the AT since being bypass by a group of young men heading up to Lonesome Lake AMC Hut in NH.  I was vacationing in the area in my pop-up trailer.
My family has always loved the outdoors and we've camped quite a bit taking day hikes as part of that experience.  Bonfires at night, reading by the fire, cooking smores for my two boys.
Soooo, one of my sons asked if I would like to go on this journey with him......mmmmmm.... no questions just ""YES"".",,View Entry,"Dec 29, Sun",0
goforet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625613,Sitting around tonight attempting to book some transportation to GA from ME.  We've decided on  Amtrak Train.   Just another piece to add to the Adventure for the both of us.Sooooo I'm just sorting through where we would like to get on the train and get off.  Wondering if it's better for Gainesville or Atlanta.   Gainesville seems to be the better choice but have to do some more research first.Cheers for now !,,View Entry,"Jan 05, Sun",0

goforet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625722,"My son was out today and we did some equipment checking on his gear, think he'll have to get his larger backpack to make sure he has enough room for all his gear.  He has some luxury items but he's young and probably can handle some extra weight.  Maybe I'll sneak some of my gear into his pack..... LOL !

goforet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625951,"Hey all, just been going over equipment and doing some last minute gear adjustments in an attempt to make sure I shouldn't swap out any of my gear.
Also since I'm Canadian, I've had to buy some extra medical insurance just in-case this old body needs some medical TLC.  I can assume it will need some TLC anyway but anything over and above the regular.
Oh, and trying to get my honey-do-list done as well, :) !!

Got some pizza once we got to the hotel. Bummer they couldn't allow us to stay two nights.  Got our laundry done and did some resupplying.  Next day went to Blood Mountain Cabins with our new trail family.  Books, Turn 2, KT and Father time.  Back on trail tomorrow.  Nick had to get a new set of poles, one of his broke already.  Time to chill.","Neels Gap

Only made it to Steel Trap Gap and had our first campfire.
It was a great evening, chatting around the campfire eating our supper.  I went to bed and read my book before falling asleep.
I bunked in with Nick this evening.  Too lazy to setup the hammock.","Unicoi Gap

The campsite was above on a flat area about .4 of a mile above the Gap.  We were tired from the hike today and were quick to settle into bed for the night after having some supper.  I opted to share my son's tent this night and I read some finishing one of Kobo books before falling a sleep.
Father Time was up early and on trial by 630am while TK was out about an hour later.  Woke up to find that she left her poles to her tent behind. LOL.  I packed them out knowing I would find her at Muskrat. 
Crossed over into NC today. Oh what a feeling!! Woohoo !!
Couthouse Bald was a killer climb.  Good thing we're we hiking with a younger group who were full of humor and kept the sprit high.
 Sure enough she was there all curled up in the shelter in her sleeping bag.  Time to setup my hammock and get some supper.  Trail up the","Dick's Creek Gap

As predicted it rained most of the day.   We tracked on rain or no rain. 
Funny how the mind wanders sometimes.  I was listening to music one day which was helping me with the hills this day and the song ""Donald where's your trousers?"".  I burst out laughing remembering being down at our friends and they had been singing that very song and Wendy in her Scot accent hitting it home.  Fond memories!
Got to the Carter Gap shelter early afternoon got setup.  Had supper early to warm up the body.  Cup of coffee to add to the fire.  Then just sat around talking till bed time.  Need to warm up again.","Deep Gap

Woke to a lite rain so breaking down was not really fun today.  By the time we got on the  trail it was 1030am.  The weather broke mid morning which was good.
By 2pm we made it to the forest service tower.  The sun was out with some cloudy skies. We sat and had lunch which was refreshing.  100 mile marker.  
Hiked on and stopped at the next shelter for water.  Had some energy left in the tank so pressed onto the next shelter.  Rock Gap","

We managed to stay ahead of it and kept rolling.  
In one of the gap by the hwyway we meet the man who runs BaltimoreJacks hostel.  What an awesome gentleman.  He was just wondering if there was any thing we needed as he was willing to help.  Had a great chat until the rain started and we hustled on.
Sun was trying despressly to come out and we took this opportunity to have some lunch.  Pita wrap tuna bacon bits with pepperoni.  Mmm good, beats a granola bar anyday.  We made it to Siler Mt Bald Shelter.  Body is tired so we called it.  Going to do a medium day tomorrow.","Rock Gap

goforet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626997,"Left Siler Bald Shelter and what a climb out of there.  Something to be said  for hiking in the mountains.  It was a wet morning and seemed like we were always hiking in the wet these past days.  Our bodies maybe wet from the weather and sweat from hiking the mountains but our spirit reminds high.  Lots of ups and downs today, seems more up than down.
Took a couple of spills today, one hitting my shin and the other right infront of Nick twisting my ankle alittle.  Almost did a face plant but my poles saved me.
Man the trail is muddy and covered with leaves.  I'm not the only one to slip today, a gentleman from Chicago did a full onside crash similar to me.
The views when we have them are breathtaking.  I can believe no get to experience this with my son.  The other day out of the blue he says to me ""love ya Dad"" as we just walk down the trail.  Man am I lucky on so many levels! 
We did make it to Wayah Bald where there's a overlook building but the weather wouldn't cooperate in the least.
Finally made it to our final destination Cold Spring Shelter.  Next stop the NOC.","Siler Bald Shelter

goforet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627163,"Slept in my son's tent last night due to the projected forecast of heavy fog moving in which makes it cold and damp in my hammock plus after a long day hiking yesterday this old man was tired, LOL !!  Woke up early to a heavy fog or cloud sleeping with everything wet outside the tent.  My son's a good sport about looking after his Dad and allowing him to bunk with him.
So up and at 'er, got some bfast and off to the NOC for some resupply and a nearo-day !   The sun peeked through during the hike and we make some decent time up and around the small peaks.  What a great day hiking today but we know the downhill into the NOC is going to be tough as we've been told.  The views today were amazing, can't get over how beautiful this part of the country is.  To just stop and smell the roses so to speak and look out over the mountains, valleys, trees, meadows, and the trail is beyond description.  Photos can only barely touch the beauty I see. 
Walking along coming into one of the Gap's, Nick spots a sign ""TRAIL MAGIC AHEAD"", leaves me smiling from ear to ear and he knows it.  We meet a lovely retired couple who offer us as much as we want!  We have a soda, chips, cookies, peanut butter cups and I refill one of my bottles of water.  God made lots of Angels out here !  Time to hit the trail once again for the hard climb out of this GAP.  Many of the hikers we've meet along the trail are now hitting this Gap now to enjoy the Trail Magic as well.  Up, up we go.  Finally we made it to the top. Whew !!  We hike along the top for sometime and enjoying the views.
Soooo downhill we go and it certainly is downhill.  Young and old complain about this steep decline into the NOC and I see why.  I'm sore but that's ok, it's part of taking in this beauty and enjoying life on the Trail.
Into the NOC we arrive and see some friends we've make on the trail, chat and exchange stories about our small journey.  Do our resupply which is somewhat more expensive here.  We've make arrangements to stay at GeorgUS Stays !  After getting this sorted out we go into the Restaurant and take advantage of a burger, fries, onion rings and a beer !
We call for our shuttle and Nick grabs us some beers to go from the General Store.","Cold Spring Shelter

There's sitting area with table top games, TV, fireplace, WiFi, snacks for a price, coffee and large washrooms with HOT showers.   Such a beautiful little spot in the mountains.
I get on the phone with my wife while my son showers to check in and tell her about our progress.  I see some concern on her face during the video chat, ""You have to come home !"" Awe, crap what's wrong ?  HEALTH CARE COVERAGE WILL ONLY COVER US TILL MARCH 23 THEN WILL BE CANCELLING DUE TO GOVERNMENT ADVISORY FOR CANADIANS TO COME HOME !!   I feel like someone just dropped a log on my chest, I can't believe it !!!!  130 miles in. 17 Days !
I now have to have a conversation with my son about what to do.  I know this isn't going to be a easy conversation, 1yr long planning, exercising, gear setup, hotels, flights, and Brenda driving us to Portland, ME for our flight.
After some conversation with Helene (hostel owner) and my son, we decide to sleep on our plan of action.   Flights out of Asheville, NC or rent a car both over an hour away.
