Sea level,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625685,"I'm sitting here at the cafe, very much a routine on friday nights.  I'm thinking about my upcoming hike, and everything that has happened along the way these last two years.  I have been soo focused on planning this trek that I did not give myself any time to process what I was planning.  This will be a benchmark moment.  My late boss/friend helped me plan my trip for 9 months before he really fell I'll.  I have a ton of support from my cafe family and friends, and they will be tracking my trip on the wall. I have many more personal reasons for the undertaking...I'll save them for my next entry.",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Fri",0
Sea level,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625688,"""The Great American Roadtrip."" That one phrase will either strike fear in your heart, or give you the warm fuzzies. When I was growing up we made numerous trips to,and from the east coast. I have vivid memories of those trips. My dad was not an interstate driver. He would find different routes to our destinations. Along the way he would find points of interest for us to visit. Places like Rock City, Mammoth Cave, Raccoon Mountain, and many other locations he thought we'd enjoy. Looking back however, my favorite trips were always what he called ""Ambush Education."" These were trips that brought our textbooks to life. Civil War battlefields, Presidential homes, Pre-Columbian Indian sites, all things he felt we really needed to learn. How does this tie into the AT? Well...many times our trips would take us to the Blueridge Pkwy, Skyline Dr., and even through the Smokies. The old man would pull over at a rest area or a scenic overlook and just stare into the wild.  He would often look at us and muse ""Imagine what it would be like walking through this area."" In hindsight, those trips, and that one statement, paired with the look in his eyes probably planted the seed for my descision to attempt this endeavor.  I have carried this memory with me, and since my fathers passing in 2005 I've carried him with me. I guess you can say that I'll carry both along the trail without adding any weight to my pack.",,View Entry,"Jan 11, Sat",0
Sea level,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625700,"I'm sure I am not the first person to have this problem.  6 years ago I weighed 370 lbs and was wearing size 52 pants.  It has been a long road to get where I am now.  I ran into a small problem while checking my gear.  Almost all of the cloths I purchased for my hike a year ago are too big. The good news is most of my stuff was purchased at Walmart.  I highly recommend people look in to the Russell line for thier base layers. My Altras hold up well, but the insoles breakdown a little too fast for my liking, I put Dr. Scholls in there and they seem to work well. The shoes are fantastic! I've been wearing them for a couple of years now, and that is my only complaint. I hadn't thought about weight loss prepping for my hike. So for those of us out there hiking for health, be prepared for some unexpected consequences. Have fun, be safe, and enjoy the miles.",,View Entry,"Jan 11, Sat",0
Sea level,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625765,"Growing up we have people that we look up to. Over time who they are might change or our opinions of them might change.  For me personally I always wanted to be my father.  He was a well rounded individual, I would call him a renaissance man of sorts. When I was 14 I added one more person to that list.  My younger sister.  
    The summer before my freshman year my little sister went blind. I'm not talking about ""needing glasses"" blind; I am talking about ""struck down by the hand of God"" blind.  In the coming months and years she has demonstrated countless times how much stronger than me she is.  She loved playing Kickball with her friends, and shortly after having a serious brain surgery, and with staples still in her head, she convinced some of the coaches and players to have a try-out to see if she could still play.
Through everything, surgeries, vision loss, bone pain, and a laundry list of other issues; my younger sister is still going strong.  I am 100% certain, that if she was able to make this trek with me she would be right beside me. She is the strongest person that I know. She is just one more reason that I am going to complete this trail...because i know that she would, and ask for seconds at the end.",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Wed",0
