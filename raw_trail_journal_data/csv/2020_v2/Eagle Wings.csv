Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626281,Got my new backpack for the trail.  I retired my Gregory Atmos AG 65 after last years 1250 miles.  The rock scrambles in NH plus the extra 2 pounds of weight got me looking for something else.  I enjoyed my zpack duplex tent last year and I hiked with many folks who gave high marks to the zpack packs.  The pack has the same amount of storage as my Atmos but I will have to rework my packing routine since the pack layout is different.  Looking forward to getting on the trail soon to do some test runs.,,View Entry,"Feb 16, Sun",0

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627179,Day started with my wife and granddaughter Reese driving me to the trailhead and seeing me off.  The majority of the hike was level or downhill with only one relatively small climb to the shelter.  I started at 1030 and arrived at the shelter at 1600.  The shelter already had 2 occupants (Bob and Ron) who work for the Air Force.  We had a lot in common and some good discussions throughout the evening.  Later in the day a father (Colin) and his 6 year old son (Ethan) arrived in camp and joined us in the shelter.  Ron built a nice fire and Ethan was really excited as this was his first hiking experience.  Ethan helped collect firewood and stoked the fire thru the evening.  It was great to see camping through  the eyes of a new camper.  Before dark a woman was walking her dog near the shelter and came into camp to give us the news that the governor of Va had closed down schools for at least 2 weeks due to the Coronavirus outbreak.  It always amazes me how information travels on the trail. It got down into the low 30’s at night and I slept comfortably.,"Compton Gap

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627180,After a good breakfast I left camp at 0900.  The weather was cool and overcast but no rain.  I met many day hikers and got the news from one family that President Trump had declared a national emergency due to the Coronavirus.  I got to camp around 1500 and met 4 retired folks from Nevada and Colorado who left Harpers Ferry several days ago and were hiking to Georgia.  While in camp they got an email saying that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) had closed the office in Harpers Ferry and was developing a response to the national state of emergency.  We all talked about possible issues if the trail was closed or services were reduced.  The weather forecast was for rain overnight and a possibility of snow in the morning.  It got cold thru the night but I slept well.,"Jim & Molly Denton Shelter

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627181,Awoke to a cold morning and a slight snowfall.  Got started at 0830 to a dreary day of cold winds and intermittent snow and rain.  I didn’t meet anyone on the trail and didn’t stop for lunch because of the weather.  Arrived in camp around 1400 and didn’t have many options to go any further today.  I got out of wet clothes and set up camp.  There was plenty of firewood available in camp so I built a nice fire to warm up to while cooking dinner.  The skies cleared before dinner and the temperatures started to drop for the evening.  I slept ok but was still a bit chilled from the day.  I had the camp all to myself for the night.,"Whiskey Hollow Shelter

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627182,"I woke up to a beautiful sunrise and left camp around 0830.  Today was the day to enter the “roller coaster” and I had 9 climbs to get through before I arrive at the Bears Den Hostel.  The AT guide said the distance was 9.9 miles but Guthook’s said the distance was actually 11.9 miles due to all the switchbacks ahead.  The temperatures remained cool.  The first 3 climbs took most of my energy so I had to eat more and stop more to let my legs recover.  I ran into one SOBO (Tail Spin) who started at Harpers Ferry several days ago.  She confirmed the ATC was closed and we exchanged what info we could and then moved on.  I arrived at Bears Den around 1600 and was able to get into the hiker area before the hostel opened at 1700.  The hostel was a great stop for a tired and sore hiker.  The hiker special was $35 and included bunk, shower, laundry, pizza, soda, ice cream, and coffee and pancakes in the morning. I had the hostel to myself and enjoyed the food, warmth, WiFi, and TV for the evening.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627183,Left the hostel at 0815 after a great breakfast.  Day was cloudy and cool with a stiff breeze most of the day.  I had 3 major climbs to complete before I finished the roller coaster.  I finished the climbs with a fair amount of effort and then had a fairly level or slight uphill climb to my next destination.  I had 2 options for destinations today: Blackburn Trail Center or the David Lesser Shelter which was 3 miles further than Blackburn.  I chose the Blackburn Center since it had a hiker cabin with a wood stove rather than staying in an open shelter.  I arrived at 1400 and set up camp.  I shared the cabin with 2 other hikers and slept very warm and comfortable.  The Blackburn center is run by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club but the center was closed due to Coronavirus concerns.  The caretaker at the center said the club was considering shutting down the hiker cabin soon.,"Bears Den Hostel

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627184,I awoke to a beautiful sunrise and got on the trail at 0830.  I saw 2 white tail does grazing near the trail.  I made great time most of the day until the last 3 miles of the journey.  The increased amount of rocks and steep downhill slowed my pace.  I arrived at 1400 and was met by my wife who had come to pick me up.  We went by the closed ATC center and took a picture and then we went to see where the train derailed and took out the walking bridge across the Potomac River.  All in all a good 6 day hike (58.7 miles) and it seems best to stay off the trail until the Coronavirus emergency is over.,"Blackburn Trail Center
