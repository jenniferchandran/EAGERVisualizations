Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579318,"Officially under one and half years until it's trail time and I'm super excited...
On June 19, 2017, I made the decision to through-hike the AT. Since that day, I've held that decision really close, telling only my wife about it. Keeping that secret in was rough as I worked out the details with her. On July 3, 2017, I announced my dream to some close family and a few very close friends whom had listened to me talk about the AT for the past two years. Let's just say nobody was surprised...LOL. On July 20, 2017 I let the news slip out a little further in a post on my personal Facebook page with an obscure message, figuring that those who know me best would understand. Let's just say I found out a little more about who really knows me and who doesn't. However, I also posted a more detailed announcement on my blog ""The Purposeful Hiker"", which documents my thoughts and feelings about my hike and my story. More posts to come as the research and planning process is now starting to unfold. Until then, I'll just keep reading books about the AT and continue to dream. I just finished ""One Trail Many Ways"" by Jim Dashiell. It's a very good read...I'll give it a 4.5 out 5 rating...Check out my blog and please share it in social media as the bigger story unfolds… Be_again  https://thepurposefulhiker.blogspot.com",,View Entry,"Oct 09, Mon",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579452,"My name is Mark Waligora. Thanks for taking time to read my story. I have always lead a pretty active life. In my 40’s, I even began running, weight training, and cycling to keep balance within my mind, body, and spirit as I aged. My passion for exercise even turned into an obsession for long distance running races and triathlons, with a goal to compete in a 50 and 100 mile Ultra Running Race before I turned 50. It seemed like the older I got, the more that I wanted to challenge myself to greater feats of endurance. The mental challenge of training, along with the energy of races, kept me feeling youthful and healthy. However, it would all change on February 17th, 2016. At the age of 48, after facing several months of debilitating pain, I was diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). 
 Early in 2014, after a series of multiple injuries, which I wrote off as just sports related at the time, I decided to take 6 months off to rest my body for an upcoming challenge. The plan was to start late summer of 2014, after I healed, to prepare for a personal goal to run 3 half marathons in 3 months. I’d put on a few pounds as I rested and the holidays were coming up, so you get the point. The training was also in preparation to start some more serious training for a 50 mile Ultra in the spring of 2015. While training for the first half marathon, I again started to have pain in my shoulders, feet, toes, back, elbows, and fingers. The pain was random at times, and seemed to move around for no reason. I really didn’t think much of it, as pain was normal with training, or so I thought. However, I pushed on and fought through the pain with the help of modern medicine that could mask the pain for a period of time.
 On Oct 25th, 2014 it was finally half marathon time. I took a couple of pain relievers, immersed myself in the energy of the other runners, hobbled up to the starting line, and bang, it was go time. I wasn’t really out to PR the race. It was more about the long term plan, so it was a slow go from the start, and once I warmed up and the endorphin's kicked in, I was feeling good.  However, I can remember it exactly, I had just hit mile 10 when the pain struck with a vengeance in my lower back, almost dropping me to my knees. The pain was so severe that I should have withdrawn from the race, but with only 3 miles left why quit then? My motto was always “run until you die, or something breaks”. So, after a few minutes, and a couple more pain relievers that I had tucked away, I finished the race. Well off my pace (1:55:49), but at least I was under 2 hours. Little did I know that at the time, that would be the last race I would ever run...
 The following day, and the months before my diagnosis, the pain intensified so much that it was unbearable at times. The aches and pains were relentless day and night. It even hurt worse when I was resting. The pain was so severe that I was not sleeping much. I could barely walk and, at times, I struggled to even get out of bed. Emotionally and physically, the constant pain took its toll on me, and mentally I just couldn’t understand why. I sank into depression, became irritable, and I was just a miserable person to be around. My world was upside down, my goals slipped away as the holiday approached, and frankly, I was an unbearable beast to be around as the pain was consuming me.
 2015 was really kind of a blur as I look back. The pain eased up a bit after seeing a sports doctor who prescribes steroids, which did the trick of masking the pain. My training was spotty, as the pain would seem to come and go without reason. Without consistent training, however, I was lost, and I began drinking and eating more as the stress, anxiety, and depression was sneaking its way in again.
 Friends of ours, along with my wife, had planned a trip to Sedona, AZ with a 4-day hiking and camping trip in the Grand Canyon in October. Well if I can’t run, I could still walk, I think...Yes, finally something to look forward to- a long distance hike?  I’m mean, I did do a full trail marathon before. What’s hiking, but just a long walk? In preparation for the trip, I started some light training by walking and weight training. When October came around, it was another round of steroids, and I was good to go. After 2 days of trails in beautiful Sedona, 4 days of hiking to and around the Havasu falls area and spending 3 nights on the floor of Grand Canyon, I was in love with hiking! 
 The following month after that life awaking trip is when my whole universe fell apart. It was the kind of relentless pain, no longer masked by pain relievers, and the emotional torture that makes you realize why people take it into their hands to end their lives. That was the waking moment for me to finally seek additional medical attention, instead of seeing a sports doctor who was just pushing pills. No longer will steroids mask the reality of the pain. I knew something else was wrong. After seeing my regular doctor, she immediately sent me to the Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist talked with me about possible causes, such as Lupus, MS, and RA and sent me to the lab for blood testing.  I can’t tell you the hell that I went through waiting for the results of the tests.
 As a youth, I was plagued with a mild form of Psoriasis, which is dead flaky skin, inflamed red spots, which were mainly confined to my elbows and knees. In fact, I was very lucky, as these places where easy to conceal with clothing, but nevertheless, the impact of this disease takes a toll on one's conscience, confidence, and emotions. I did my best not to let my condition control my life, and for the most part, I lived my life like most normal teens while hiding, as best I could, my embarrassing red patchy skin. 
 As time went on, I sought out many different treatments. Many of which had little effect, as much wasn’t known in the medical field about Psoriasis. Topical creams, steroid cream, sunlight treatment, eating more turkey. Yep, turkey. Like I said, not much was known and ultimately these treatments did not work.  It wasn’t until my early 40’s that my Psoriasis seemed to go away all by itself. Well, at least about 98% of it. I was so relieved, but little did I know that it was just part of the storm that was building in me. You see, about 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop a form of inflammatory arthritis called psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Like psoriasis, PsA is an autoimmune disease, meaning it occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, in this case, the joints and skin.
 It’s now closing on 2 years since my PsA diagnosis and my treatment consists of a once a week pill form of Methotrexate. Methotrexate is typically used for chemotherapy for cancer patients, but it also has positive effects on RA patients. So far, I’ve had good results and most days, I’m around 98% pain-free. However, the Methotrexate scares me. It scares me, even more, the longer that I’m on it. I’m told that I’m on it for life.  However, it’s necessary in order to live my life without constant debilitating pain, which is not something I’d ever want to go back to.
 I’m now 49 years old, and my diagnosis has made me think about my life, my goals, my dreams, my universe…I still have a lot to learn and a lot that I need to unlearn. I want to live a meaningful life and accomplish new personal and spiritual goals. One of those goals is to inspire others to live with purpose. In retrospect, getting sick was a call to action for a greater story yet to unfold. Be_again!",,View Entry,"Oct 13, Fri",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579658,"Ok, now that you’ve read my story, let’s get a few things answered. Why am I doing this?  Well, there are a few reasons.  Thanks to the guidance of the book “Appalachian Trials” by Zach Davis, here are my reasons why and what I will accomplish as a successful AT thru-hiker…(wow, It felt awesome to put that in ink!) 
I am thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail because…        I’m fizzling out in my career, and I’m ready for the next adventure.        I need to unlearn who I’ve become and learn who I want to be.        I’ve lost faith in humanity and society.
        I need the time to find my purpose, and I’m not getting any younger.        I miss the challenge of pushing myself to the limits.        I need to remind myself that my disease doesn’t control me.        I want to inspire others.        I want to leave a legacy story behind for my family.        I went to bed on an overnight hike doubting that I could thru-hike the AT.        when I woke up the next day I realized that was a foolish thing to think.
When I successfully thru-hike the Appalachian Trail I will...        be ready to take on new opportunities, both personally, and professionally.        have a better outlook and perspective on life and people.        have overcome my personal fear...You’ll have to read my blog. https://thepurposefulhiker.blo...        be more compassionate, patient, and understanding of others.        learn to love more.        accomplished a goal that I thought was impossible before I even tried.        have a better vision of who I am.        leave an incredible story behind for my family to share.        be stronger physically and mentally.        tell my story to inspire others to Be_again.
Ok, the last and most important list.
If I give up on the Appalachian Trail, I will…        continue to live in fear.        let doubt control me.        let my health become an excuse.        never believe in myself again.        settle for who I became.        have to face myself and others as a quitter.        give in to fear, and give up on dreams.        leave an ugly legacy of shame behind.        have this failure haunt me for the rest of my life.        not get to inspire others.
Now that I got my list complete, there really is a lot more meat and potatoes behind these reasons.  Which makes me think, maybe I should blog more about my reasons further as I prepare for my journey towards enlightenment and purpose. Unless you're really interested in hearing about the struggles of my gear search…ZZZZzzzzzz Ok, maybe the gear search story could be exciting if it involves me hiding out in a REI for an overnight in store camping adventure...Everything is possible!",,View Entry,"Oct 18, Wed",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579947,"Recently I had a six month check up with my Rheumatologist to follow up on my latest lab work and review a few things. Along with treatment, the Rheumatoid Factor, or RF levels, are routinely tested by a taking a blood test to measure the proteins produced by your immune system. Having high levels of protein in your blood cause them to attack the healthy tissue in your joints, which cause severe pain and can lead to permanent joint damage. Additional blood testing is also routinely monitored to watch the liver function, as high doses and long-term use of Methotrexate has been associated with chronic liver injury, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Lucky me, as I despise needles of all kinds. However, after two years of getting poked on a regular basis, I’m getting used to the ordeal. It’s almost routine maintenance now, like getting the oil changed in the car.  And, Yes, a band-aid, smiley sticker, and a sucker make me feel a lot better about it.
On that morning, the doctor came in ready to deliver me the latest results of my lab work. First, she leads off with, “I’m reclassifying your PsA diagnosis to RA”. As you can imagine my response to this, “OK, what?”.  It’s funny how my mind immediately shifted to things like, “what about my blog! My blog references my diagnosis of PsA, not RA. I also just wrote an intro to my other blog on the AT journal. I mean, what am I going to do now?”….Wait, deep breath, let’s focus on what she's telling me. She obviously has some additional news that is really more important than the name my disease is labeled with. I would have liked to know what she was thinking as she saw my jaw drop like I was just given the worse news ever.
So, as of my latest test results, I had indeed lowered my RF activity to the remission status level. I contribute this to the medical treatment and some personal life changes. My liver test also came back normal...Ok, I can live with the diagnosis change in exchange for that outcome, besides it doesn’t really change my message. I still have an autoimmune disease, and I still had psoriasis. Now they are just not packaged together. In fact, now I get the opportunity to inspire two groups of people, what a great day it turned out to be!  She also lowered my Methotrexate dosage to see if I can keep off the RF radar, #savemyliverplease. PS, she still doesn’t know about the AT thru-hike yet...LOL
I’ve said it before that my blog really isn’t about my condition. It’s real, now more than ever, more about my awakening to shift and reshape my life and to live with purpose. When I was diagnosed with PsA, now RA, that still wouldn’t have changed the first thing that I thought of, which was, “how can I beat this, and not let it beat me!”  Only you hold the power to live your purpose, and I can only hope that with my stories, I can inspire you to learn how to shift and reshape your life. As Dr. Wayne Dyer said, “If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change”. Obstacles, changes, setbacks, hardships, etc...are really opportunities. You have to accept them and embrace any challenges with the willingness and desire to Be_again.",,View Entry,"Oct 25, Wed",0

are only given one chance to live, just as there are only one sun and one moon. However, the sun and moon have

source will long outlast our own personal lives, so find your purpose early and
live it to the fullest.
Recently,
on a hiking trip in Sedona, AZ, I was blessed to sit with my wife atop Bell
Rock to watch the sunrise. I started thinking about my list of the reasons why
I wanted to thru-hike the AT. Yes, the list was in my pocket, as I now carry my
list with me everywhere I go. As the sun slowly rose over the mountains,
providing light to a new day, I began to think about one of my reasons, “I need
to unlearn who I’ve become, and learn who I want to be.”
“Unlearn
who I’ve become”? Allow me to explain. As I began the process of “adulting” in
my 20’s, life took me down a path of necessity. Things like work, parenting,
responsibility, and social conformity seemed to consume my every step, and as
the path narrowed, it lead to the safe
route and the comfortable daily work-life routine. I was living The American
Dream; new homes, new cars, promotions. I rose to the top of my career and
became an expert in my industry, but was I really living the dream? Don’t get
me wrong, working is important, but working in the corporate world had
distracted me from my own personal thoughts, dreams,
and freedoms. My life became for the good of the company goals and not for the
good of myself and my family.
I
somehow was also taught that to be successful, I needed to follow the path of
what society and commercialism wanted me to be. Ever since the development of
suburban America, we’ve been programmed to work hard, earn more, borrow more, and
buy more. We are told that stuff, new stuff, expensive stuff, big stuff, makes
you happy, and is the measuring stick for success. Hence the phrase, “Keeping
up with the Joneses”.  While I don’t think I ever officially entered that
race, the anxiety, stress, expectations, and goals of others took its toll on
me, and ultimately, it affected my health.
As
the sun continued to rise in the sky, each minute a new picture was painted
across the mountain, giving me hope that each step on the trail will provide me
with an opportunity to unlearn who I’ve become so that I can open my heart, and
my mind, and learn who it is that I want to be. You only have one moon, one sun, and one life. It’s never too late to
inspire others and to live life with purpose, with our own personal purpose,
and not our skewed image of The American Dream.
When
I successfully thru-hike the Appalachian Trial I will Be_again.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580959,"doubt; a feeling of uncertainty or lack of conviction, feel uncertain about fear; be afraid of.
Continuous self-improvement is not an easy path. With all the daily distractions, it’s easy to wander from the path. Let’s face it, the world doesn’t stop spinning just so you can focus on your personal healing. However, when we are not at our own divined intention, it’s easy for our personal demons to seamlessly sneak their way back into our lives unnoticed, where they manifest and build up until our own emotion dam breaks.
Dec 1st, 2017, was probably one of the lowest emotional and mental points in my life in a long time. But it’s amazing how the universe presents its opportunities, even at your lowest moments.  As my personal demons were slowly gathering on the banks of the emotional river, unknowing to me, the universe was already rallying my personal search and rescue team.  Earlier in the week, I was contacted by an old friend of mine who lives out of state, informing me that he was going to be in town and that he wanted to meet up for dinner.  I graciously accepted…  Also later that week I was contacted by a new friend of mine who started out the conversation with something like this…What would it personally take to make 2018 a great year? He wanted to meet up that next morning for breakfast. Hum…I’m in!
Here I was, just about ready for my dam to break, and two amazing people that are both on personal and spiritual journeys themselves, reached out to me a day apart to get together. Coincidence? I’ll have to say that within those meetings, I had probably two of the most powerful conversations that I’ve had in awhile. I’d love to give you all the details of our discussions, but the combination one-two punch helped me to realize that my dam had slowly filled and that I needed to release some water so that I could get my demons back in control.
Having close friends as an adult has always been a real issue with me as I’ve lived in fear of judgment, skepticism, and disappointment. It was just easier for me to avoid personal friendship.  Yeah, that is a whole other issue I’m working on.  I am so grateful today that I now have some true friends, old and new, that are also seeking personal enlightenment and growth. Friends that know it’s “ok” for us to openly discuss our fears and feelings without judgment, even when it involves tears and hugs are required.  It really was an awakening to understand that I’m not alone in my journey and that many men just like myself are seeking to unlearn who they’ve become as they search to Be_again. It’s nice to know that you don’t always have to hike alone.
As I prepare for my new life journey, I hope to inspire others along the way, on the trail, through my AT journal posts.  I’m also super excited to say that my new friend is working to also transition his personal life to follow his dream as an independent filmmaker, documenting personal legacies.  How did we ever cross paths to becoming friends, I ask again coincidence?  Nope, thanks Universe…Hold on tight, as the story has officially started and it’s going to be a wild, funny, and inspirational hike!  I just hope that I don’t get eaten by a bear…LOL.",,View Entry,"Dec 03, Sun",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581952,"Five, four, three, two, one...Happy New Year!  As the ball dropped at the start of the New Year, many of us made new year resolutions. Maybe it's to lose weight, eat healthier, find a new job or something else that is personally desired to improve on. I for one don't make New Year's resolutions. I see resolutions as wishes, hope without real intent or a thought out plan of how to fully commit and accomplish the desired wish. Instead of a resolution, I choose to lean further into finding my spiritual side and to open my mind and heart deeper on this incredible journey of life. I am free of fear.
This year, the weather has been brutally cold in the northern midwest and opportunities for hiking have been few and far between, which has greatly reduced my spiritual sanctuary. If you haven't figured it out by my previous blogs, I love hiking. And while the winter provides new perspectives of landscapes and views all covered in ice and snow, minus 10 degrees is just ridiculously cold and downright dangerous. So this winter, I've been getting my steps in on a treadmill and yep, some mall walking...minus the fanny pack and water bottle hip belt...for now... I wonder what the mall authorities would think if I walked around with a full out backpack, only to stop and fire up some lunch on my camp stove, or sling up the hammock for a quick nap by the fountain? I am in control.
Just prior to Christmas, I had another severe panic attack. My fear story had caught me with my guard down. It allowed an opportunity for doubt and anxiety to sneak in, and it kicked me right where it hurts, all while my ego then took over control of my every thought. It wasn't very pretty.  Staying on the path to fighting my fear and finding meaningful purpose is not always an easy task. These sneak attacks can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere, just as it did when I let my guard down. Understanding that exact moment when you stray from the path, acknowledge your misstep, and pull yourself back into living an intentional life is so powerful. Trust me, this is not an easy skill to learn, but important to learn before you get lost and find yourself in a state of panic. This is obviously something that I know I need to improve on. I am found.
So, as the ball dropped to ring in 2018, this year once again, no New Year’s resolutions. Just a focused continuation to further lean into living an extraordinary life and to identify my personal warning signs before I end up on the floor, curled up in a ball sucking my thumb again.  So, until the weather breaks, I'll spend my time walking indoors, reading and listening to spiritual and personal guidance books, sound healing, meditating, and fostering friendships with like-minded people. I am going to beat RA, I am fearless, and I am going to Be_again.",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Sun",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586835,"“If I only knew then what I know now”. What does that really mean, and would it even change who I am today? Would I really be any different? And would I still say that today, if I actually did know then what I know now? So what’s the point?
This year I will be turning 50, and what used to seem like a point in life that I considered to be old it’s now a point in my life that now feels like a rebirthing. A chance at a fresh start with 50 years of experience behind me. Some might call it having a midlife crisis, as I try to break from the day to day life that I’ve seemed to settle into. “Snap out of it”, “Get back to life”, some say. “You have a good career, stability, and a comfortable life, so what’s the problem?”
Trust me, my midlife crisis is far from going clubbing, social drama, snazzy clothes, fast cars, and staying out all night, partying to feed my ego. In fact, it’s completely on the other spectrum. I look forward to downsizing, simplifying, developing meaningful relationships, and fostering unconditional love. My midlife journey is about evolving into an enlightened person, as surely there’s more to life than just living comfortably. As a chronic overthinker, the struggle I deal with is more about the question, “when and what does that really look like?” Finding the answer has not been an easy task for me. To find balance, while dreaming big, and still trying to live in the daily life cycle has proved to be challenging, to say the least.
As we approach graduation season, I can only think of what it would have been like if I followed through on a dream I had back when I had my life ahead of me. After graduation from high school, the plan was to take a year off to explore the US with no real plan or time frame in place. Ultimately, under the pressure of societal norms, and the safe and normal path to “success”, I entered college not knowing who I really was, who I wanted to be, or what I even wanted to do.
With now almost 50 years behind me, I have finally learned who and what I want to be, and have daily visions of how I want to bring it all together. I’ve also made my intentions publicly known. A huge weight off my chest, no later than the spring of 2021, I will start my 2200 mile journey to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail from Springer Mountain, Georgia to the summit of Mt. Katahdin in Maine. The struggle I now face as an overthinker is how do I get to that day without wishing my time on this earth away until that long-awaited goal.
To truly be happy, one must learn to enjoy every day and live in the moment. This has been my challenge but I will prevail. Hiking and weekend camping has provided me a release from the time rushing thoughts in my head, but yet the freedom of the trail also contributes to the incredible desire to do what I planned to do as a wide-eyed child, explore. So, for all of the youthful souls and dreamers on your 2018 AT thru-hike, I bid you safe travels and remember; “There’s no rush, enjoy what the trail offers, as you’ve got the rest of your lives to live comfortable”. That is what I know now. May the trail angles shine upon you. No pain, No Maine!",,View Entry,"Apr 15, Sun",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595208,"Up and up, keep climbing. Will this mountain ever end? Every time I think I’m about to summit, around the bend there is another seemingly endless incline. Weighted down by my backpack, gravity has slowed me down to a snail’s pace. Chest pumping, legs burning, I fight for each step as I gasp for air. I pause and drop my pack to catch my breath. As I gather my thoughts, I take a drink of water and longingly take in the view. But there is no stopping now, no turning back, for the trail behind me is gone, eroding away with each step that I take. But ahead, there is light. I cinch up the straps on my pack that contains everything I own and drive forward with anxiety and anticipation to a destination over the top of Mount Unknown. Beep, beep, beep…5 am already? I need coffee…
Every trail has a start and a finish. Sometimes it’s out and back, maybe it’s a loop, but in life, it’s a thru-hike. Long or short distance is your choice, or sometimes it's not. As we start life’s trail, we are filled with thoughts and beliefs, some of which are learned, and some come to us by chance. And as we continue to walk the trail of life, we grow, we develop, and, through our experiences along the way, we forge our own thoughts, visions, and beliefs which become our reality.
I am at the place in my life where summiting Mount Unknown is becoming a clearer vision for me. While I have an idea of what that decent to the valley of life will look like, the journey continues to shift and evolve. If there’s one thing I’ve learned in my 50 years on this beautiful planet, it is that there is one thing you can count on; change. Yet embracing life changes have been extremely difficult, and frankly downright scary for me.
For most of my life, I hid my emotions and fears from family and friends, giving the world an outward appearance of a strong and successful man. It’s what society has conditioned us, men, to be. I have always put my family and my job first, and never allowed myself the time to explore all of those things that I dared to dream about. Panic attacks, relentless stress, and fear hardened me over time to the point where nothing impressed me, and the beauty of all things in life and love seemed to fade to a world of gray.
I’ve always struggled to put time aside for me, to get to know myself. Maybe I was scared to find out who I am and why I am here. I often wonder what would my life be like if I would have lived for me and not allow fear to control so much of my life.
The universe has divine ways of showing you signs to the path of enlightenment, but often we don’t recognize those signs, especially if you are conditioned, hardened, and not open to receiving them. When I think about it now, there had been signs for me all along life’s path, and even very early on in my life, to change my course before I ended up on the floor in the fetal position, again. I could elaborate, but wait, this is a blog, not a book.
I’ve seen the sign again, and it’s time. Time to receive it, time to act upon it, time to awaken. I will not let my fear control me any longer. I will live in a world of color, I will live to love and honor myself, unconditionally, again. The calling is powerful, and a new beginning is near. For the mountains are calling me and the feeling is so powerful, so strong...I have to go. YES, I’m crying! Be_again...the adventure awaits.",,View Entry,"Jun 24, Sun",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599158,"Well, it’s been a while since I last posted to my trail journals page. However, I have added some stories to my blog at thepurposefulhiker.com.  The stories on that blog are more about my personal life, with a touch of hiking mixed in, as many of the story ideas come to me when I’m in the woods and kicking out some miles on the trial. My intentions for this journal page is to keep it more on the lines of hiker business, aka my whereabouts and trail encounters.
So, what have I been up to?  Watching the sands of time slowly fall into the bottom of the hour glass until 3-31-19...just kidding. Actually, a lot has been going on!  About 80% of my gear has now been purchased, and I plan to have most of the balance of it by January. It’s amazing how much money you can save by just watching and waiting for the right sale, and of course hitting a REI garage sale now and then. I won’t get into all the details of my gear selection, as I believe that everyone has their own personal preference to what they like and don’t like.  I say, if it works for you, then stick with it. It’s not my job to sway you. That’s what corporate marketing is for..lol
However, I have been updating my gear list on this website as I go, and even for items that I’ve already exchanged, a few times. Some things are just not as advertised. I do have a few shake down hikes planned for this fall, so I’m excited to do some further testing on my selections in the real woods, rather than the backyard. But don’t hold your breath, I won’t be doing any gear reviews. That is, unless you're a manufacturer reading this post and you're willing to contribute to my gear fund. Cash is king! Wink, wink...
I’ve also started to organize a hike plan in an excel spreadsheet that I share on Google Docs with my trail boss (my wife).  While I know that the trail and journey is fluid, I still need to make sure that I get to Katahdin before it’s snowed in, so having some goals will allow me to gauge my progress.  Also, I'm hoping that a hike plan will help me to gauge things better for mail drops and friend and family visits, (Hot Springs is must for my wife,she loved the mineral spa). It will also allow me to create a budget plan and set some guidelines, since I don’t have deep pockets and I’m surely not a trust fund baby.
I also just ordered the 2018 A.T. Northbound Guide book by David “Awol” Miller. Awol on the Appalachian trail, by the way, is a great read. After reading many reviews on guides, this one seems to be the guide that would best suit my hike. Hike your own hike. My plan is to incorporate estimated location information into my spreadsheet from the guidebook so this way I have a better idea as to where all of the AYCE’s are, and I can plan for some hostel stays. I’m not really concerned about it not being the 2019 guidebook when I head out, as I have faith in the hiker grapevine to fill in any gaps, as I surely won’t be leading the bubble.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602646,"Well, I just can't go on a 6 month hike without leaving something behind, like a job. Last week I gave notice of my ""early retirement"", more like a ""career pause"", until I figure it all out or not.  A lot of people have asked, why so early on my notice, I guess it's just been my nature to try and leave things better than they where when I started and this will allow time for them to prepare for It.  This will also give me ample time to close up all of my projects and to train my successor. With that said, I've announced it on my website www.thepurposefulhiker.com for the world to see.  Here's my story...
My Proclamation - By Mark ""Purpose"" Waligora 
Many people dare to dream. While some dream big, some dream small, but to most, dreams are just that, wishes to do something extraordinary, life-changing, purposeful, adventurous, risky. Dreams may come and go, but some dreams stay, weighing on your conscience with each and every waking moment. I was no different. Many of my dreams got stuck in limbo or lost in life changes. As I lived out my everyday life as a father and a husband who was forging a career in an effort to provide stability for my family, there simply was no time to dream or to chase dreams, so I thought. I put many of my dreams on a shelf, like a book, in hopes that someday, in my golden years, I would have the time to read that book and act on them.
The golden years? What is that? Why wait? We only have one life to live, one chance to fully embrace our existence on this glorious planet, the opportunity is now. We all have the power to choose to rise, to live, and to Be_again, an again often. I will no longer put off following my dream for a fear that only I have manifested in my head, my “What if Story”. Aging teaches us many incredible life lessons, for I now know that I can handle anything that comes my way in the adventures of life. The passion and dream to thru-hike the Appalachian National Scenic Trail some 2,190 miles from Mt. Springer, Georgia to Mt. Katahdin in Maine have a grip on me so tight that it consumes my daily existence, just ask my wife, kids, family, and friends. Therefore, the mountains have called, and I must go. On March 31st, 2019, I will do just that. Not dare to dream, but to follow a dream and live that book and write a new chapter to be etched into my history.
The Appalachian Trail, or simply called the A.T. is one of America’s oldest walking paths. It was completed in 1937, which is an amazing story of itself. Every spring, around 2,500 people set out to claim the title of thru-hiker, which means to hike every step, pass every white blaze (trail marking) in a single season. While less than 20% percent of those who set out actually finish, I'm determined, with the support of family, friends, and fellow hikers, to be one of the 20%. There is no doubt that this will be the most challenging adventure that I’ve ever embarked on, both physically and mentally. The A.T. has been known to be life altering in many ways. Many set off on a mission seeking out to find themselves, lose themselves, to restore spirituality, to find faith, to rejoice in life, or to mourn a loss. For me, I seek all of those.
For the lack of better words, I’ve announced my retirement to my employer from my career job in early March to make way for this grand journey. I say “retirement” with “tongue in cheek” for what does it mean to really retire? Do we just stop working, learning, and living, only to fade off into the sunset on a horse over the horizon, or to drop over dead as a doornail? I want neither…I’m simply just hitting the pause button of my everyday routine, my ordinary life, to finally take the time for me to create an extraordinary life. To not put off a could have, only to live out the so-called golden years saying that I should have. Work is just that, work, and I finally realize that my career didn’t define me as the person I am today, or whom I really want to be. While I’m extremely appreciative of my career accomplishments, and all of the people and things in my life, leaving my career was the first step, a fearful step, in surrendering myself to The Universe and its divine plan. Work will be there in some shape or form when I come back in 6 months. but right now, I won’t say I’ll be missing it.
Shift, shape, live, love, laugh, cry and never give up on your dreams. You do have a choice to make it happen and to Be_again. I will. ""Purpose"" - A.T. Hiker Class of 2019",,View Entry,"Sep 10, Mon",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604257,"With just under 6 months before I take that first step on the Appalachian Trail at Springer Mountain, it’s time to start some pre-conditioning as a preventive strike in tackling the 14-state journey.  Many people have asked me, how does one prepare for a 6 month, 2,190-mile hike? Easy I say, slow and steady, as thru-hiking the A.T. in one season is not a race or a competition. However, as a north bounder (Nobo), I will be in a race against mother nature to summit Mt. Katahdin before winter conditions close the trail, all while taking the time to fully live in the moment of the journey.
As a previous Marathoner and Triathlete, I just didn’t roll up to the starting line and take off when the gun fired. It took me several months, up to 8 months at times, to build up the strength, both mentally and psychically, before I ever thought of crossing the starting line. Quite frankly, it took me a few years to build up my endurance to get to the point where running Ultra’s was in my sight.  With that said, I just won’t hit the ground hiking, I will need to develop a solid physical foundation over the next 5 months to build my endurance safely, and to lessen the chance of a serious injury.  One should never just strap on a backpack loaded with your life essentials and set out to climb mountains day in and day out. While, yes, you can ease yourself in during the first miles on the AT, most people don’t. They rush into it, only to suffer dearly. In the case of long-distance hiking, this is one case where the tortoise will likely outlast the hare.  
Living with Rheumatoid Arthritis has challenged me to keep in shape. At the age of 50, I am admittedly a little heavier than I want to be. However, my condition has been a good reminder for me to stay active, as I truly feel better when I’m on the move and taking care of myself.  In January of 2017, I joined a virtual race called the Amerithon. It is an online forum, in which you track your daily distances. You walk, hike, run, swim, bike, or crawl your way in the virtual United States, from coast to coast, at your own personal pace.  I set a goal to finish this trek before my 50th birthday, in September of this year. I did just that, one day early. Over the span of this virtual journey, I’m proud to say that I averaged just over 5 miles per day of walking, hiking, and some cycling. It was an amazingly fun and rewarding journey. 
Now that my 3,521-mile journey across America is over, I took a few weeks off to rest up and to let my body recover.  Unfortunately, exercising my fork to my mouth didn’t take that same time off, but now I’m ready to start my conditioning in preparation for the trail.  A thru-hiker will experience the elevation of climbing Mount Everest 16 times in under 100 miles and it will take approximately 5,000,000 steps to get to the end. So trying to figure out a good training plan for such a quest is not an easy task. It was pretty easy to find training plans for marathons and triathlons, but what I haven’t found is plans for a long distance hiking that involves carrying everything that you’ll need on your back. So, while you don’t need to be in tip-top shape when you start the A.T., It will probably be better if that shape isn’t round.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605143,"Just under 5 months now from trail day 1, but who’s counting? I’m not really trying to rush the time by, especially with the holidays coming up. I want to thoroughly enjoy life and all of the family time that I can get before heading out on my 6 month journey. I think missing my family and friends will probably be one of the biggest challenges of the hike. Hopefully they’ll get a chance to visit and to hike with me along the way, or at least meet me at a trail head with a bucket of fried chicken, yum!
I just recently finished up a 20 mile overnight gear check hike on the Knobstone Trail, aka “The Little A.T.“ of Indiana, in some nasty cold and rainy conditions. However, it was perfect conditions for some confidence building and to get a better grip on my hypothermia concern with all of the lightweight gear that I’ve selected. Overall, I was pretty happy with everything, and I was as warm and dry as one could be in the back country. I also did find a few adjustments that I will need to make before my final pack. Most of these that I uncovered were all space saving ideas, along with the hope to also save a few ounces.  
My pack weight for this shakedown trip, with all of my A.T. cold gear and minus any food and water, came in at 19 lbs. This was pretty darn close to what I had calculated in my spreadsheet during my selection and purchasing process. Not that I want to add any weight, but I might just switch out my 1 person tent for a 2 person tent for a little more room.  But for now, I’ll start with the 1 person and see how it goes.I also was inspired to write another blog post for my website thepurposefullhiker.com .

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605970,"Wait, what? And just like that, an unexpected diversion. Both on the trail, and in life, unplanned reroutes can occur unexpectedly. And while your destination is still the same, it just might take you a little longer to reach it. In the past, reroutes or diversions would push my emotions to the edge, to say the least. I would think; “how could they?” “why?” “Well, there goes my plan.” “Ugh, so what now?” Sometimes, OK, many times, to the point of anger. Enough anger that it even could ruin the adventure that I was on, as I would cast aside any joyful experiences I had along the way just to dwell on the “spoiled plan”. Then, in angst to stay on schedule, I’d drop my head with hurriedness to make up for any lost time, without taking in or appreciating the journey. Go, go, gooooo... Stressing over the things that I can’t control is a personal issue that I, and no doubt many of us, need to work on.
As I work to control this self-inflicted characteristic of mine, I’m going to embrace life's reroutes and look at them from a different perspective, to slow down and fully live in the moment. To not rush through life, but to look at every moment as an experience and recognize that maybe the reroute was part of another plan by the Universe for a reason that is yet unknown to me. Now when I am rerouted on trails, instead of getting frustrated, I’ve been accepting that it just may take longer. I mean really, how can it be bad, I’m on the trail doing what I love to do. So, embrace the experience and see it as an opportunity through exploring eyes, and from a perspective that is anew, afresh.
When you think about it, life is full of reroutes, and it’s how we react to these unforeseen changes that can define us as individuals. Have you ever had a friend that just lives and loves life, goes with the flow but still manages to be accomplished and focused? It’s one thing to just be a “surf bum”, but it’s another to be a surf bum who owns a successful business or has a job that they love, is caring, giving, and has amazing friends, and family. These people are simply amazing and a joy to be around.
So anyway, getting back to the big reroute in my life right now. This month I was presented with a reroute, I was left pondering which way I should go. A few months ago, I put my dream plan in place; to retire from my career job and to pause my work life, so that I could embark on the 2200-mile life and a soul-searching hike of a lifetime, from Georgia to Maine, that is the magical Appalachian Trail (A.T.). I had even gone as far as announcing my retirement to my employer, and also to friends and family so that I could prepare for this adventure. However, the Universe had another plan for me, a reroute.
Ok, I will just cut to the chase. I’ve decided, with mixed emotions of both happiness and sadness, to postpone my Appalachian Trail thru-hike start date until 3-23-2020. I know, WHAT? It wasn’t an easy decision to make I really convinced myself that 3-31-2019 was my start date. However, divine guidance often times reveals itself unexpectedly. A life reroute, that maybe whispers, or sometimes shouts, to say you’re not just quite ready, slow it down and enjoy the side trail, and don’t worry because the destination hasn’t changed. It’s now becoming a little clearer to me that maybe, just maybe, I wasn’t 100% ready mentally. There were a few obstacles that I would have had to navigate through, which would weigh on my conscious during the hike. These hurdles could impact my ability to fully embrace the spiritual journey that I’m looking for.
Bottom line is, I still have some important family commitments that I need to navigate through, which would have been tough to manage from the trail. It was looking like I would have had to leave the trail at least 3 times to accomplish this. To fully embrace the spiritual A.T. experience that I’m looking for, I feel that it will be best to not have the pressure of having to hike with “a trail schedule”. While one could make a case that there will always be a commitment or hurdle, these simply had to be planned and scheduled, and that’s not how I want to start a journey of a lifetime. So, in the end, what does this all mean? Back to work for another year, embrace the reroute, and know that the final destination is still the same. Be_flexilble, Be_again.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606222,"Well, now that I've officially moved my start date until March 23, 2020 what am I going to do until then? Easy...work, love, live, hike, and blog about it of course.  Here is my latest post called ""B_prepared!"", from my site www.thepurposefulhiker.com.  Of course you aspiring thru hikers already know this stuff. Happy New Year and 2020 will be here before you know it. 
Be_prepared!  
A question that I hear often from people that are new to hiking or backpacking is, “What do I need to know? Do I just head out to the trail and start walking?” While this may sound like a good idea, it’s not a safe idea. The number of rescues or recoveries from lost or ill-prepared hikers is staggering. So, as you enter the New Year with aspirations to get in touch with nature and your inner-self, please don’t just walk into the woods without understanding that, while walking is easy as you just put one foot in front of the other, hiking can be dangerous if you’re not prepared. Becoming a statistic is probably not how you want to start out the New Year.
Whether you're planning a multiple day backpacking adventure or just a day hike, it's important to be prepared for an emergency, as well as being aware of the weather. You should pack wisely for every trip, and always be prepared for the possibility to spend a night or two out in the woods, and potentially in bad weather. This is especially important if you're hiking alone, mountaineering, traversing low traffic areas, or even in a state park during the off season or during the week. Though, even if you may be hiking with others, and in high traffic areas, you should still pack some core essential food and safety items.
One thing that is often overlooked by day hikers are things like situational medications and even preventative prescription medications which you might need in the case of an emergency. Such as medications for temporary pain & fever relief, allergies, bee stings, poison ivy, and your own specific health condition medications for things like seizures, high blood pressure, low blood sugar, ect., that you may need to have just in case you unintentionally have to spend a few nights waiting for rescue. Remember to pack these items in a waterproof container or a Ziploc bag. If your life depends on a medication don’t leave home or hike without it.
Another thing that is really important, and that I always see day hikers without, is water. Of course, when packing for an overnight or longer backpacking trip, this is a must. Backpackers should always be knowledgeable of the availability and the condition of any water sources along your journey and plan for water drops if needed. However, for any hike, long or short, you should always bring plenty of water. Avoid soda, sports drinks, dairy, juice, coffee, or alcohol, and also use a reusable bottle, please. Dehydration is sneaky fast, and can lead to cramping, overheating, fatigue, hypothermia, unclear thinking, and even death.
There are many good hiking websites, Blogs, and Vlog sites that you can to refer to for what you should pack for every type of hiking experience. However, I prefer to reference the professionals from REI or Backpacker.com for best practices. And remember to please pack out what you pack in. The woods or shelters are not your personal garbage dump. If you're new to hiking, or even an experienced hiker, there are many free opportunities by your local hiking clubs, REI, or local Outfitter that you can take advantage of to get familiarized or refreshed on the best hiking practices for yourself and the environment.
Most importantly, always let someone know your hike location, route, and expected itinerary. If you're hiking in an area with little to no cell reception, you’ll want to let your contact know that you won't be checking in every day, and more likely, not until the end of your trip or when you can reach cell service. Then, don't forget to check in when you're done with your hike. Let's not waste the service of any rescue team because you decided to stop for ice cream and forgot to call mom, who's been sitting at home worrying about you getting eaten by a bear. Just remember, it's really hard to find someone if the rescue team doesn't even know where to start looking for you.
Here is a link to my current gear list that I have for various levels of hiking. Which backpack and gear that I take is dependent on many variables of the trip. Disclaimer: I’m not a hiking expert so my list or advice is by far not a call to action; Pack your own pack and take a hiking class first, before you just step into the woods. Be_smart...Be_again.

Several years ago, I read the book “The ONE Thing”. It was gifted to me by my employer. Yeah, yeah, thanks boss…I thought to myself, knowing that I’ll read it if I get a chance. I mean, I already had a stack of books to read, and quite frankly, it’s wasn’t my style. I do like self-help books but at this stage of my life, it’s not about advancing my career, it’s more about finding spirituality and embracing my inner hippie. Don’t get me wrong, I did appreciate the thought at the time, but really, a book given to you by your employer? Seems suspicious, what’s in it for the man? LOL. Of course, I said “Thank you”, with a big and gracious smile as I stuffed the book into my backpack and made my way out the door.
A few months later, my work schedule had me traveling around the globe with lots of cloud time and quiet hotel evenings. One day, as I rushed out the door to catch a flight, I forgot to grab the book that I was reading, and I found myself book less on a long haul flight. Once on board, I search around in my backpack, in hopes to find something to read that I may have overlooked. That’s when I found “The ONE Thing” that I forgot about, the book. With nothing else to do on a long plane ride and long trip, I decided to crack it open and started to read it. All the while wishing that I had found a Backpacker magazine buried in my backpack.
After a few chapters of reading the book, I found myself questioning the author’s theory, trying to understand my own message that I schemed up in my head. How you can live life with just doing one thing at a time. I mean, in today’s world if you’re not good at multitasking, you’re not going to survive. The temptation was strong to put the book back into my backpack until I could offload it at the next book exchange. However tempted I was to do that, I simply thought there must be more to this book, I mean what am I missing? So, with a long pause and deep sigh, I decided to read on.
After a few more chapters, it finally hit me like a ton of bricks. This book isn’t teaching you to only do one thing. It’s teaching you how to compartmentalize your energy, time, thoughts, and life in order to focus on that one specific thing that you’re doing, for that specific moment, for however long you determine that moment to be. Of course, we all have many things that we need to accomplish each and every waking day. But trying to do them all simultaneously at once is just crazy. Yet we try to do it anyway. So why even try, when it’s usually not our best effort? For us to believe that we must do everything all at once, simultaneously, in order to be successful, or feel accomplished, is like trying to be a one-man band who doesn’t even know how to play one single note is downright ludicrous.
So, what does this have to do with hiking? For me, everything! Just as I’m physically preparing myself for my 6-month A.T. thru-hike (3-23-20), I’m also preparing myself mentally for it. As a sufferer from anxiety, fear, and I'm an over thinker, this awakening concept was important to learn as I navigate through the things that I can’t control. A practice that reaches far beyond just tasks, but for me, opened my eyes to compartmentalizing my thoughts and emotions to better serve me. I’m relearning to live life fully and be in the moment. While some moments overlap or run parallel, I’m learning to organize my thoughts into bite-sized, digestible life chunks instead of taking it all on at once. It’s “Ok” to turn everything off to Be_again.

My RA Life...
On February 17, 2016, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA is a chronic, progressive disease causing inflammation in the joints, which can result in painful deformity and immobility, especially in the fingers, wrists, feet, and ankles. RA is an autoimmune disease that also affects many bodily functions, including the cardiovascular and respiratory system. It could have been worse, I told myself. “At least I now know what’s been causing the excruciating, relentless, and debilitating pain”. Currently, there is no cure for RA. Aggressive medications can slow the diseases progress and, with regular treatment and lifestyle improvements, the best one can hope for is remission.
For me, this was not an option, I will beat it! As of last year, I’m happy to say, that while I still have the classification of RA, I am in remission. While my body reacted well to the treatment, remission would have been a challenge if I didn’t take more control of my life. I was not going to let this invader disrupt my life and tear me down without putting up a fight. The minute I was diagnosed, I vowed to give this disease the battle of a lifetime. A battle that I now fight each and every day because of my quality of life and the length of my life depends on it. So, what does my RA life look like? Actually, it’s not much different than any person who chooses to live a healthy lifestyle.
Living a healthy lifestyle means a lot of different things to different people. And what works for me may not work for you. The key is to never stop trying to live better, something that takes persistence, patience, and perseverance. You have to want to win the war, and not just hope to win one fight. I personally did a lot of research on RA; reading articles, blogs, any information that I could find, and kept an open dialogue with my doctor. Knowledge of your condition is everything when it comes to intervention, and it took a lot of trial and errors to figure out what worked for me. So here are some basics of “My RA Life”.
Sleep: Sound restful and peaceful sleep is the foundation of living a healthy life, regardless if you’re sick or not. I sleep a minimum of 8 hours per day, allowing my body and mind to recover each night. I also use an essential oil diffuser while I sleep. Essential oils can help reduce stress and relax the body, mind, and soul. I also have an earthing/grounding mat on my bed, which helps to reduce inflammation and has many other health benefits. Seriously, look it up. Have you ever wondered why you feel so amazing when you’re barefoot at the beach? It’s not just because you’re on vacation!
Exercise: The benefits of daily exercise is given. Making excuses to not exercise is how you lose the war. Exercising outdoors and in the woods even takes it up a notch. There’s actually a name for it. Look up Forest Bathing. I have a 1 hour lunch period. In reality, it only takes me 15 minutes to eat, so that leaves me 45 minutes, 5 days a week to walk at lunch. I walk for a minimum of 2 miles. After work, 2 days a week, I do weight training. I also do this 1 day on the weekend for an hour. After dinner, it’s usually a walk for anywhere from 2 to 4 miles, either outside, or at the gym, if the weather is bad. And on the weekends, hiking, here I come.
Food: It’s a simple philosophy, garbage in, garbage out. If you seriously want to feel better, stop eating processed food and lean towards a fresh Mediterranean diet. If you’re a meat eater like me, just cut it back a little at a time. I only eat meat a total of 6 times a week. Servings are 4-6 ounces. I treat myself to red meat once a week, if at all. I currently follow the meatless Monday practice and I intend to reduce my meat consumption even further. I suggest that you see a nutritionist and learn about food combinations for RA, and then mix in a holistic doctor’s point of view. No fast food EVER! It’s not that hard if you just plan ahead. Also, consider what you drink. No soda, sugary drinks, and reduce the caffeine. Yes, to water and fresh lemon juice, please.
Supplements: Getting everything your body needs to fight the war is not always possible with just a healthy diet, so I’ve added the following supplements to my daily regimen. I take folic acid daily to counteract the side effects of my once a week methotrexate treatment. I also take daily the following supplements; turmeric, fiber, hemp oil, fish oil, a probiotic and a multivitamin. I also take twice a day, a small dose of CBD oil, which is thankfully legal in my state. There are so many amazing health benefits to CBD oil for RA patients.
While there are so many more details about My RA Life that I could expand on, like spiritual health, stress relief, and overall mental health, it would require me to write a novel. Hum, let me ponder that thought. Anyways, the main point of this post is this, if you want to get better, if you want to live a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life, then take a look in the mirror because it’s all on you and nobody else. It’s up to you, and only you, to shift your life, shape your life, and Be_again! You got this...
A.T. 2020 Thru-hike Start Date Countdown Clock: 390 days and it feels so good!",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Wed",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608783,"Last Saturday was just an ordinary day, hold on, actually, no it wasn’t. Saturday was the official start of the one-year countdown to my official March 23rd, 2020 start date for the Appalachian Trail. The A.T. has been on my vision board for a very, very long time, and one year from yesterday, I will take the first of many steps northbound from Georgia to Maine, via America's greatest footpath. The path to turning visions into dreams and dreams into reality is not always under your control. However, losing sight of your vision is, that is if you don’t keep them top of mind, and acknowledge them every day.
If you’re not familiar with what a vision board is, it’s simply just a board. It can be a cork board, poster board or any other board that you can hang on your wall in plain sight. In my opinion, one of the best spots for a vision board is in your bedroom. This way you can see it in your first refreshing, waking moments of the day, and, before you slip off into dreamland for the night, it will fill your mind with beautiful thoughts. The purpose of a vision board is to keep you centered, focused, and grounded between the conscious world and your desires and dreams and bring those dreams into your future reality. My vision board brings my dreams closer to reality and is a personal tool to expand on my life and deepen my connection with my inner thoughts. 
There is a process for creating your board. You should first determine the things or feelings that you want to manifest in your life. It’s best to write them down (if you meditate, meditating on what you want to be, do and have is a great way to start.), then search the internet, or browse magazines to find images, words, pictures, articles, and phrases that represent these intentions. You’ll know them when you see them. It’s important to note that where you can post material things like cars or homes, you should really focus on feelings and experiences that you want to attract into your life. This gets you more connected to your inner self, and what truly will bring you happiness. My board is ever evolving, just as life shifts and evolves. I will check in with my board every few months, and make whatever modifications make sense as the magical journey of life unfolds and my path shows itself.
So, you may be wondering what’s on my board. Just as I mentioned above, I have items that resonate with feelings of what I want to be, do and have, and how I want to feel when those things become reality. For instance, I placed the A.T. symbol on my board many years ago, not originally as a goal to through hike it, but for how I thought I would feel if I could or did.  Hiking is my sanctuary, it’s my mental happy place. Hiking brings me clarity, clears my head, relieves stress, brings inner peace, allows me to release anger and let in love.  The thought of the length and challenge of the A.T. brings me joy and reminds me of how much I really loved to push myself, mentally and psychically, when I was a long-distance runner. The A.T. symbol made me feel alive. Putting it on my vision board allowed me to dream, and if your dreams don’t also scare you, they're not big enough. The Universe created the opportunity for me to thru-hike it. I just had to feel the fear and take it.
While there really are not any rules for what you place on your vision board, there are a lot of things it is not. It’s not a materialistic, goal-directed road map, a step-by-step life process, a New Year’s resolution, or a strategic plan designed to rigidly guide your life day to day.  It’s not a personal barometer or a measuring stick. It’s simply a peaceful place that will guide your intentions and affirmations of how you want to feel and a way for you to manifest and show gratitude for these things that are available to you when you dare to dream. When you allow the space and take the time to be intentional and grateful for your dreams and desires, and work with your vision board, you’ll be amazed by what happens. Having a vision board will change your life.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614335,"It's been awhile since my last post on the trail journals page and my last blog post for that matter.  Time has slowed, almost stop, which is good in many ways but stifling when you got the A.T. on your mind 24 hours a day.  I've been following a lot of hikers on their 2019 trek and it's so awesome to see the pictures, hear the stories, and watch their miles add up. After talking about this stuck feeling with a good friend of mine the pen came out again.  Here is what I wrote on my blog page thepurposefulhiker.com.  
I Need to Get Out of Here…
Here, what is here?  Where am I even at?  Where do I want to be? Do I even need to be anywhere? I made the decision to postpone my Appalachian Trail Thru-hike in order to be present during some major events happening with my family in 2019. This seemed like a good plan at the time, and my employer helped to sweeten the deal. “What’s one more year?”, I asked myself. After all, it’s just time, and I’m excited about the family transitions this year. The wait is just adding one more chapter to the story of a fulfilled and free life. Then, the anchor of time drops...
I don’t need to have all of the pages written before the journey even begins. So, why do feel like I do? Why does my story have to be a detailed trail map guiding me to the end? Who even wants to reach the end? Thoughts of the A.T, P.C.T., C.D.T., road trips, mountain life; My dreams have become limitless, yet all of these possibilities cloud me, confuse me. Is it a to-do list, or just wishes & dreams?  These desires are so vividly alive that they become overwhelming, blocking my creativity, and ultimately, stifling my growth for this opportunity to slow down and love, laugh, and just live for today.
I’ve become stuck and lost again all at the same time, waiting on time to pass...How will the next chapter of my life look and why do I need to know now? The wishing of time to pass for these days to get on the path to living out my dreams, I know is not how I want to be. I know that I shouldn’t rush through my life, looking past the present, just to rush into the future. I think I know what I need to do to become unstuck, so why am I not doing it? Why am I so overwhelmed and so confused?  Meltdown in 10, 9, 8…..
Then,  “SMACK”, it hits me square in the face, holy shit, I’m in the middle of a midlife crisis, seeking to find my purpose. Calm down, it’s not what you think, I don’t want to buy a sports car, I don’t want to leave my wife or have an affair.  I just want to hike the A.T. for six months and release all that's blocking my new growth.  I don’t consider this a crisis. The word crisis implies negativity. I prefer calling it a midlife enriching moment, and acknowledging it is the first step to understanding how to navigate and grow from it. Tick-tock, tick-tock...Be_again.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616479,"Happy Father's Day to all of you Dad's past, present, and future. A special shout out to all of you Dad's on the A.T. this year.  Here's a story I wrote for my blog site  www.thepurposefulhiker.com .The Father's Day Trail - By Mark ""Purpose"" WaligoraOn Father’s Day for this Dad, who’s now in transition to becoming an empty nester, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I fathered my kids.  For you new Dads or Dads-to-be, there is nothing in the world that prepares you for the hike called Fatherhood. Being a parent can be compared to a strenuous hike. There will be ups and downs, twists and turns, slippery rock hopping, swift river forging, roots, rocks, ruts, mud, bugs, bears and more. Is Fathering a day-hike? Nope. Is fathering a thru-hike?  Not even close. Fathering is a lifelong hike, and the trail blazes are not marked clearly. For this journey of Fatherhood, not one trail map has ever been completely drafted.
Most of us, like me, Father in the ways that we were taught by our Dads, or other Father-figures in our lives as we grew up.  I was taught that Dad’s were to be the provider, the security, the rock, the enforcer, the leader, Superman; all the things that our masculine dominated society expects, in a Tim Taylor, grunting, kind of way.  My Father passed away at an early age. And it really didn’t dawn on me, until now, that I really didn’t know my Dad outside of his teachings on life. It’s now that I wonder, what did he dream about, where did he see himself in this world, did he cry, did he hurt, what was his crazy and silly desires, was he happy, would he have been proud of me?  As his final years slid by between us, I find myself wondering today, why did the hugs end? Where did they all go? A question that I’ll never get the answer to.
As a Father, I’ve come to now recognize that I followed his lead, and I’m now questioning myself, “Am I a good Dad?” I only hope that my kids are as proud of me, as I am of them.  I was always there for my kids when they were young, but was I really present? Or did I carelessly wish the time by, in an effort to rush them into becoming adults? I did the things my Father had done for me, I coached my kid’s sports teams, pushed them to excel in school.  I was stern and strict, relentlessly encouraging them to be their best. Now I wonder, was it all too driven, too fast, too much, too quick. Was I loving enough? As I look back, I wish now that I would have fully taken more time to watch them just be kids, fully supporting them as they hiked their own hike.
It’s on this day that I’ve realized that the hugs on my part, seem to have disappeared.  It’s on this day that a new awakening his risen in me to get back on the Dad trail that I’ve seemed to stray off.  It’s on this day that I will Be_Dad again, as it’s never too late to live, love, and laugh more. Happy Father’s Day to all of the Dads out there, and to all of the Dad’s to come, hiking on the Father Trail has been a gift. Be_again Dad’s, you’ve got this!  280 Days and Counting - A.T. 2020",,View Entry,"Jun 16, Sun",0

Close Your Eyes, Breathe In…Exhale Slowly! by Mark ""Purpose"" Waligora  A.T. 3-23-2020
Here I sit on the same couch that I’ve written so many blog posts, as I dream of a simpler life and envision myself living a deeper, more purposeful life. Only now, I sit in an apartment that is about a quarter of the size of the home that we just sold. But somehow the world outside now seems a bit larger. My head is spinning at the amount of STUFF we have, even though we started over the past year preparing to downsize, we were caught off guard. Boxes to the left, boxes to the right, Goodwill, yard sale, and just plain garbage. How on earth did we accumulate all this STUFF, and why? It’s overwhelming, as we no longer have a place to put, store, stash stuff. Storage unit? No way! If we need to store it, we need to get rid of it. Freaking out now…but in a good way. But nevertheless just plain freaking out. I knew this downsizing exercise was going to challenge me. But in a strange way, it feels lifting. I actually feel lighter, physically and emotionally. Breathe…
With just under 8 months left before I step onto the AT, preparation for my thru-hike continues. About 95% of gear has been purchased and tested to some extent, so I’ve stopped analyzing what I’ve selected, as only time, trail conditions, and miles will determine what needs to be swapped out. I’ve been keeping up on my psychical conditioning, which is just a way of life for me to stay healthy, and keep my RA at bay. Mentally, I’m supercharged up. I’d go now if I could. Following this year’s class of hikers on Trailjournals.com and seeing them start to reach the summit of Mt. Katahdin, Maine, 2,190 miles from where they started in GA, is making me antsy. The stories and pictures have been amazing. The ups, the downs, the good the bad, the tears, the laughter, and watching what once was only a dream turn into reality for some. That’s what I’m talking about, legacy. Breathe…
My journey on the AT is all about this as well as an earlier blog post in which I said, to find my purpose I need to unlearn what I’ve learned. To do this, I have to step away from a career in which I burnt myself out. This, compounded by the irrational fear of not having enough safety and security in my job is why I know I need this. I need to face my fear of the unknown head-on, and embrace my belief to Be_again, once more, anew, afresh. Doing this has led my wife and I onto the path of Minimalism and creating free space in our lives for personal and spiritual enlightenment and ridding ourselves of material things that don’t serve a purpose or bring us joy. We now focus on experiences, relationships, and learning to be more present and intentional. We allow ourselves the space to simplify, slow down, and Breathe…
I can honestly tell you that many people don’t get it, don’t get this journey of evolving, don’t get minimalism, don’t get selling it all and hiking away to relearn and refocus on life. “Wow, seems risky”, is what I was told by an acquaintance recently. I get it. In a world that is focused on ego, fed by material possession, stature, popularity, and in many ways, driven by consumerism, it’s tough for people to understand. I’ve lived it and have been held prisoner to it. Why on earth would you walk away from a successful career and sell or give away most of your possessions, and sell your beautiful, comfortable home in a white picket fence community? What are you, hippies? as we’ve once been called. What are you going to do? Where are you going to go? And for the first time in my life, I can answer like this, I don't know…I'm just going to Breathe...and Be_again.",,View Entry,"Jul 30, Tue",0

That's a lot of maybes... By Mark ""Purpose"" Waligora
By definition, a sabbatical is a period of time away from work which is agreed upon with your employer. The word sabbatical can be interchanged with “career break” or my favorite term, the “adult gap year”. The one thing about a sabbatical is that you will get to come back to the same job, or in my case, maybe not. After working for nearly 30 years in the same industry, I’m ready to retire. However, the term retirement doesn’t sit well with me because, in the end, I’ll have to do something for “work” since I’m still a relatively young man, and well, I can’t tap into my retirement account until a few more years. However, I do know this, I need to stop doing now what I’ve been doing for almost 3 decades. I’ve burnt myself out. “Adult gap year”, yes, please.
Maybe this revelation to pause work came with aging, or maybe I’m just going crazy as I get older. Maybe it comes when you reach a point in life where you feel comfortable enough, secure in yourself, and are not willing to just live out your life to only fade away. Maybe it comes when you finally learn to fully embrace your fears and do it anyway, knowing that things, big or small, will work out as they always have in the past. Maybe I can finally trust in The Universe, grow, and just go with the flow of life. Right now, I truly feel that life’s options are limitless by pursuing personal growth, feeling gratitude, and seeking happiness.
This new thinking has way more merit today for me and I’m ready to open myself to shift, pivot, and shape in new directions in the pursuit of my personal dreams and desires. Right now, I can’t see clearly what my future holds in the next 1, 2, 5, 10, 20+ years of life and it’s “OK”, I’m comfortable with it. I can tell you what is not in my future, and that is just staying in one proverbial place, doing the same thing day in and day out, for each of my final living days. Because, to me, that’s not really living, it’s just conforming to what we are conditioned to strive for, safety & complacency. I want more, whatever that is. I haven’t yet figured it out, but do I even need to figure it out right now?
Like many of my generation, we either entered the workforce or college right out of high school and never had a gap year(s) for a chance to figure life out, to expand beyond textbook education. Then came adulting, family, and bills and our energy and time went into building a career, security, and for me, shelving my dreams and desires to think and live freely, which was a flame that burned deeply as a youth. That flame was blown out by the fear that I’ll never have enough money to survive or let alone, retire like the TV show “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous”.
So off I went to build a career at all costs, sequestering my “what if”, “crazy” desires to pause for a moment (or 6 months), so I can understand life and understand myself. I maintained the determination to keep climbing, with a goal to reach the top, to reach for the stars and beyond. The destination was financial success and “the good life”. Confusion sets in. What qualifies as “the good life”? Is it really only measured in dollars? What about happiness, joy, and wellness? Who sets these so-called success standards anyways; banks, our government, our media? Listen, don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with working, it’s a necessity to living. However, in the end, work shouldn’t be the only thing that defines us as a person. And I’m sure not going to die at my desk, working towards that type of “Good Life”. Rick Rolled, I was?
So, in just about 5 months from now, I will embrace my “adult gap year” and face the fear of not knowing the outcome. I’ve never been so excited to take, as some call it, a “risk” in leaving my career and to put trust in that things will just work out as they’ve always had. I feel young again, youthful, free-spirited, and crazy. Call me a Hippie, I don’t care, I love it. I’m so ready to unlearn what I’ve learned, and I hope, no, I trust that my experience on the A.T. will lead me to a more open, deeper, and purposeful life and to then go live it without looking back.

Transition.. – By Mark Waligora
As the leaves begin to change and gradually fall from the trees, with each passing day there’s a little piece of me that is also slowly changing. As I sit on the soft pine needles that carpet the trail, I listen to the wind gently blowing through the trees. I feel at peace watching the birds, busy at work foraging for that last bit of summer’s bounty, and observing the squirrels gathering the acorns & walnuts that have fallen from the trees, I feel different. As I breathe in the fresh crisp coolness of the fall air and notice that the flowers have now all faded away, and the once lush green blanket carpet of the forest has begun to retreat for a winter’s rest, I feel a change in me. I sit with a calm nervousness, excitement, curiosity, and peacefulness while taking in all of the rays and warmth of the sun as it shows itself through the thinning canopy. I feel content. As I sit, I ponder, if this grand adventure of thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail will be everything that I’ve been building it up in my mind to be? Will it satisfy my wanderlust, will I find peace, will I find my purpose, will I find more? And I feel alive.
My trip planning, for the most part, is complete. Calendars and schedules have been cleared, logistical plans and lodging have been finalized to arrive at Amicalola Falls State Park, GA on March 21st. My return date home at this time, unknown. I will depart NOBO on the A.T. from the Springer Mountain Trailhead and plan to forgo the approach trail at Amicalola Falls State Park so my wife can be there with me as I take step one of the white-blazed path. The date will be 3-22, which ironically is two of my lucky numbers, as my wife pointed out. A sign? It seems fitting for these numbers to appear since I had chosen these two numbers as a kid, unknowing at the time the powerful message they would reveal. The number 3 represents your past, present, and future. If something from your past is steering your present, it’s time to take control to create a better future for yourself. A message that I’m now open to receive, to unlearn what I’ve learned. The number 3 also has the power of kindness, joy, creativity, and imagination while representing inspiration, creation, of manifestation to seek personal growth by connecting a link of your body, mind, and spirit, to delicately align with spirit energy. 22, simply put, is linked with all-powerful energy in changing huge dreams and desires into realities. Need I say more?
I’ve now registered my starting details with the A.T.C. – Appalachian Trail Conservancy, which collects the unofficial, official thru hiker stats. The. A.T.C., and its numerous volunteers and clubs, from end to end, have been preserving the A.T.’s heritage since 1921. Without these trail angels, this journey wouldn’t even be possible today or for future hikers. The voluntary registration includes my direction, start date, start location, and at a minimum, the first 3 camping areas that I intend to stay in order to help others to plan accordingly and prevent overcrowding of the trail in the beginning. For voluntarily registering my hike, I will receive an official starting hiker number and super cool Thru-hiker identification bag tag when I arrive at Amicalola Falls State Park. There will be additional checkpoints along the trail to Katahdin were my hiker number will change, as hikers willingly and unwillingly leave the trail.
Many accomplished thru-hikers will say that thru-hiking the Appalachian trail is 80% mental and 20% physical. Am I ready? I know I’m ready, but yet there is a tiny wee bit of underlying fear, nervous of the unknown that still awaits my first step. However, this feeling is unlike any fear that I’ve felt in a long time. It’s more like butterflies, and these butterflies will not stop me from showing up, nor will they cloud my thoughts, or add a “Bull Shit Story” to my life. As an amateur marathoner and triathlete in my 40’s, I was always nervous with excitement on race day, but the “what-ifs” and “should-haves” never stopped me before when that gun went off. I’m ready. I will, and I can, harness this uneasy energy and craft it into the positive motivation that I will need as I move forward in my journey and head toward my final destination of Mt. Katahdin.
As I watch the colorful fall leaves drift softly and slowly to the ground, giving way to the changing of the seasons, I’m growing more at peace with myself, I’m changing. The journey doesn’t start on 3-22, it has already begun, and with each passing day, the excitement for the trail is growing. I can feel it, I can smell it, I can touch it, and I for damn sure can taste it…as I wiped the tears of joy from my eyes, I rose up with a huge smile and a warm heart and soul; I hiked on.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624959,"I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and fear for many years of my life, hiding it from my family, friends, and loved ones.  I was conditioned by society and peers to be the strong one, so I was taught to never let them see you cry, aka suck it up and toughen up.  After a few severe panic attacks that started affecting my physical health, and in the end triggering RA, it was a wake-up call to make a shift and reshape my life to, what I like to say, Be_again.  I know what it's like to not fully experience life, to not be happy, and to live in fear. And while I'm fortunate that I could find my way out, I know that others need help to find that trail of hope.   
I've been looking for an organization that was in line with what I feel could cover a spectrum of the many causes that I could align myself with.  Mental health, I feel, is the grassroots of this path in so many ways. From my own personal life experiences, it would be easy for me to align myself with parents who have lost children, RA organizations, parents and families of the LGBQT community, anxiety, depression, and the list of what I've had to navigate throughout my life could go on.  I'm very fortunate to have a wife of 26 years who supports me and who leads me to the trail of seeking personal growth, internal peace, and happiness.
The connection to hiking and mental health is so clear to me.  I like the Hike for Mental Health organization's approach to proving to aid in overall mental health, and the connection with the conservation of hiking trails and education of best practices just warmed my heart.  Bonus, that unlike many charity organizations, the donations that they collect actually make it to the hands in need. If you'd like to donate please visit my personal page donation page. https://secure.hikeformentalhe...

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625575,"As the clock counted down to 2020, I was surrounded by family and friends at my daughter’s home in central Indiana…Happy New Year!  And with those two words, it all became more real. I’m thru hiking the AT. This year!  However, it wasn’t at the exact moment that the New Year rang in that I thought about it.  I had accomplished what I set out to do in December, which was to forget about the trail for a moment, for the holidays, so I could focus on being present for the holidays and to enjoy the time with family and friends, and to not wish remaining days of the year away.  So, I made a promise to myself to not blog our journal about my upcoming A.T. journey. It was hard to do as the questions by others often arose about my adventure. It wasn’t until the next day that the weight and sheer enormity of the adventure hit me square in the face, mind, heart, and soul.  It’s go time now, and with that…the window of excitement opened wider. Which allowed for some uncertainty and fear to sneak in as well.
While my mind was at rest last month about the A.T., my body was another story.  While I’ve always been active with exercise and training, I started to intensify my workouts in December, and will continue to do so over the next 3 months, with a taper week before my step off date of 3-22. This is a training practice that is familiar to me. It feels almost reminiscent of when I was a marathoner and triathlete.  Ugh, I so miss those days, Damn RA!  So, my goal is not to get me up to 100% trail legs so I can crush out huge miles on day 1, but rather, to get me 100% prepared to follow my plan. A build up plan that will allow for me to do what the A.T. does best, build and strengthen you with each step. I plan to hike each day until I reach a comfort level to meet my daily & weekly miles to get me to Mount Katahdin, while still enjoying the journey.  So for those who have comments about my plan, “HYOH” aka. Hike Your Own Hike, which is a term said to others whom judge others trail goals, plans, gear, etc… The last thing I want to do is to over-train, lose too much weight, or risk injury before I even get to that first blaze on Springer Mountain.
While uncertainty and fear has crept its way back into the depths of my mind, I will not let my own demons win this battle.  So, along with increasing my psychical training, it’s now time to also focus on the mental training that is needed to fight the fear of doubt. It’s been said by numerous thru hikers that the game is most certainly more mental than physical, and I won’t take their words of experience for granted. My past experience with my one and only Ultra-Marathon race, prior to my RA diagnosis, taught me that 6 months of training, as well as race day, proved to be a mental beating of an epic proportion.  An emotional battle that I loved, hated, screamed at, cried over, swore to, and one that I beat, and finished, with crushing my last, tearful mile. But it’s been years since I’ve pushed myself to my breaking point. As I face my fears head on, I’ve found it to be beneficial for me to list them out so that I can cast them openly into The Universe if only to release them from my mind with trust and faith that The Universe will answer with guidance and the support needed to tame the ugly beast between my ears.
And while as silly as some of these are, they need to be released…. So, in no particular order:
Am I doing the right thing?Am I being selfish?Am I being thoughtless?Am I being reckless?Will I be lonely?Will I be cold?Will I get lost?Will I get eaten by a bear, cougar, dog, or a crazy person?Will I make it all the way?Will I be satisfied?Will I find purpose?What will I do when I’m done?Will RA win?I know, I’ve got issues, right? Knowing that I have issues is half the battle, and just sharing them with you is a joyful release. I already feel lighter in my conscious mind. These questions don’t even need the answers for now, as finding the answers just require me to take one NOBO step at a time and allow The Universe to guide me. I am confident that I will find these answers, and the purpose I’m looking for, as long as I don’t get eaten by anything, lol.  Feel free to send me love, light, and energy, or prayers, or anything wise you think may help guide me on this epic journey. I sure could use it. I’ve got this! Be_again!

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625911,"January has been a tough month for me as I fell ill on January 3rd, even though I got a flu shot in early September, whatever I caught had me down and out for 3 full days.  It’s now been 20 days and the residual effects of this illness are still lingering around, which has been extremely frustrating.  I’m not one who runs to a doctor over a cough or sniffle either, so good or bad, I guess one could make a case for that.  As tempting as it was to just sit and wait it out for good health to return, I’ve continued to push along with my trail conditioning.  On the brighter side of it, I’m looking at this as additional mental training for “dealing with the suck”. 
There are many thoughts to approaching step number one on the trail, some say very little training is needed and that the trail will provide.  I get it, take it low & slow until you get your trail legs, but personally, I’m not one who feels that this is necessarily the correct approach for me.  I’m already going to face the highs and lows of learning a new daily trail routine, adjusting to being away from family and friends, and on of that top, dealing with the ever-changing weather, hunger, thirst, being dirty, wet, cold, tired, etc... Personally, I don’t need to add to that list being extremely sore or dealing with pain that could have been prevented with some conditioning.  ""To each his/her own” they say and “HYOH”, for me it’s just my personal approach so press on I will…No zero's, maybe just a few nero's...for now.

Fade to Black... by Mark ""Purpose"" Waligora
It was like any other weekday morning. I awoke before my 5:20am alarm for work. It’s funny how after working for so many years, the body no longer needs a reminder to get up. But why, why do I always seem to get up before my 5:20 alarm? So roll out of bed I do, routine engaged…off to the shower I go, feed the dog, juice & vitamins, coffee, pack a lunch, and finally sit down to eat breakfast while catching up on all of the wonderful and uplifting news on TV, why do I bother? Drama. At 6:30am, out the door and off to work I go. However, that morning was not just like every other Friday of the past 29 years. This day was the last day of my career.  
It’s hard to explain how I felt that day. Pinch me, was this day really happening? What does this all mean to feel the fear and do it anyway, to embrace the unknown, to walk away from something that became my identity, an identity that had run its course, an identity that was longing for change. Flashback. That afternoon, as I stood in the doorway of my office for the last time, a feeling of calmness took over. I heard my inner voice say, “you’re ready,” it’s been one hell of a ride, no regrets, no remorse. Today was meant to be cherished because tomorrow a new adventure awaits. I was ready to start afresh, anew. Choked up, maybe a little, but I walked out with a warm heart, a huge smile, and knowing that everything is going to be “OK”.
What would I tell my 20-something self now? Have more fun, smile, kindness will go a long way, and the mission is not always critical. Slow down, relax and check your ego because in the end, tomorrow is another day and the sun will come up to shine again. To all of those who have supported, guided, coached, and just downright believed in me along in my career, I can’t thank you enough. Cherish. Work is just that…work, it was really all of the genuine people that made this journey amazing. I’m so grateful, thankful, blessed, and humbled that I had the opportunity to meet so many incredible people from around the world.  We are all truly more alike than we are not, and I will always remember those relationships.
50 days until my A.T. step off on 3-22-20, and the excitement is growing as the tinges of uncertainty, doubt, and fear shift effortlessly to positive, motivational energy. Enlightened.  It’s getting real and I’m ready, the pattern is now clear to Be_again.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Sat",0

While I've been practicing social distancing in lieu of COVID-19 and other illnesses, the one exception had been the gym. Today, I've decided the risk is not worth it. I'll continue to do some light exercises at home and continue with some outdoor walking. So, here is my pre-hike picture. I managed to lose 8 lbs, weighing in at 151 lbs. Not bad for a 5'6"" 51 year old guy. You can check out my beard training report to come on Monday via my Instagram account @thepurposefulhiker, lol. I'm not in as good of shape when I ran marathons, but I feel really good, healthy, and strong.
In regards to COVID-19. Just as the trees and flowers hibernate for a harsh winter only to return to their full bloom, we can all take this time now to enrich our lives, reflect, vision, and love one another. There was a time when life's pace was slower, when family time came first, when egos were in balance, and community was important. This time is now in front of you to embrace a much needed life change. Deep breath, we can do this. And we as a society will be better for it on the other side. ( Keyword: Temporary ) So for now stay safe, stay in, stay distant, and please wash your hands...Other peoples lives may depend on it. 
In 8 days, I'll take my first step north from Springer and I won't look back. So, with a heavy heart, the trail is still calling and I must go.

The world is at war from an enemy that we can not see, an enemy that has no regard for human life, and an enemy that doesn't care what your story is, what your dreams are, where you come from, what you believe in, or who you are.  HYOH, ""hike your own hike"" is the gospel of the trail. So as of today, I've decided to do my part in this war and cancel my NOBO thru-hike, which was only 4 days away. Over the past days, I've lost countless hours of sleep pondering the events of the current situation and the impact this has for the trail, the trail community, and everyone in general. For me personally, I know that I have to do what ""I"" believe is right for me and to do ""my"" part to win this war. 
This journey for me has always been about this; to unlearn what this world has taught me, and to Be_again, once more, anew, afresh. I know that I cannot accomplish this by staying out of town, not sleeping in hostels, not stacking in hotel rooms or avoiding shelters altogether, just so we can stay away from each other.  I don't want to live without high fives, silly handshakes, hugs, trail magic, hitches, etc...and the comradery of a tramily. This journey was never about keeping my head down and just cranking out miles with the only goal being summiting Mt. Katahdin. My journey is to reconnect with life through the people. 
I do not want to not give up on this dream and to stop believing. I've trained too hard, spent too many hours, days, years planning for this adventure to just give up completely.  So, while the story would be different this year, I feel that there is still a story to be told, even if it's not the way I started to write it in my head. Nor will the ending be what I've been visioning every single day of my life for the last two years. This war will end, and the light of the sun will soon shine again on the whole world.  God willing and with the power of the Universe please stop, we've had enough already!
My plan, for now, is to postpone until mid-May to monitor the situation at home and abroad.  If we start winning this war, and if trail life returns to some sense of normalcy, I plan to do what is called a Flip/Flop thru-hike.  For those who don't know what this means, here is the short version. I would start my hike at the midpoint at the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy) Headquarters in Harpers Ferry, WV and travel north to complete leg one by summiting Mt. Katahdin (Northern Terminus), in Maine, around the end of August. I would then shuttle back down to Harpers Ferry, WV and travel south to complete leg two and finish my thru-hike by summiting Springer Mountain (Southern Terminus), in Georgia, around the end of November. The only real goal in this situation would be for me to be home for Thanksgiving, which is my favorite holiday! 
Everything is changing so fast. Please stay safe, be kind to one another, please practice social distancing, wash your hands, etc and pray for ""Life Magic"".  Yes, I'm crying... Purpose",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Wed",0

Hero or a Zero - by Mark Waligora
Today, as we start another 30 days of social distancing to fight, well you know already, I’ve lost faith in starting a Nobo Flip/Flop. Yes, sadly, I said it…The conditions in relation to this pandemic don’t seem to be improving at all, even in the areas of early infection, it’s just not slowing down.  In fact, the county that I currently reside in Indiana is now considered to be the next hot spot, which frankly is starting to scare the living shit out of me. While I live north of the major area of the population in Indianapolis, the fact that this virus is camping out in your backyard is a bit stressful and emotionally draining, as I continue to witness people ignoring the social distancing guidelines.  Let’s just say that good, restful sleep has been more miss than hit since early March.
As a person who has Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), I take Methotrexate once a week to treat my autoimmune disease.  However, Methotrexate, which in high dosage is used to treat cancer, puts me in the immunocompromised category. Simply put, my immune system is always in a weakened state which puts me at greater risk of infections. To top it off, even though our family is active, non-smokers, not overweight, and eat fairly healthy, we’ve been blessed with hereditary high blood pressure, so strike two.  On a positive note, a couple of things that I have going for me is that I’m still under 60 and I don’t have any history of respiratory issues. I even outgrew my seasonal allergies many years ago. Not to mention, I’m still in really good shape, but from what is being reported, I’m not sure that the virus cares about that. However, strike 3 is that females fare almost 50% better than males do in terms of mortality. 
Since I took early retirement to thru-hike this year, spending my days at home has not been an easy task. My wife and I decided to downsize last year and sold, donated, and gave away about 90% of our belongings and moved to a small apartment in preparation for her to live the simple life, while I was on my journey.  We wanted to simplify our lives so that we could enjoy the outdoors, travel more and not be tied down to material things and the “stuff” that comes with owning a big home. My wife is fortunately still working full time. She has been working from our little apartment, on our dining room table since early March, double monitors and all. Our last offspring was away in Chicago, attending college and she has been home now for weeks with a dorm room full of stuff that well, has no place to go… So here we are now looking like ” The Simpsons”, not just trying to squeeze onto a couch together, but trying to live in harmony in our tiny apartment, dog included.  
I held on to hope, looking for trail magic in life, that a miracle would happen and I could still thru-hike this year, even if it was a flip-flop. I’ve come to now realize that I need to let that go. I’ve still been training at home, not to just stay in shape in case that life magic happened this year, but training now to boost my immune system and help me fight it if I did contract, I’m not going to say it. My wife has been putting me through some pretty intense cardio/bodyweight workouts 5-6 days a week tuning into some live and app-based workouts that her gym, F45, is offering during the shutdown.  I’ve been also walking 6-8 miles a day, avoiding people and doing my best to adhere to the 6 feet rule. It’s been a challenge at times, as I’ve learned that many people have no concept of distance. We’ve also been playing some pickleball, tennis, and as the weather continues to warm, we’ll be hitting the backcountry for some local overnights as long as there are not people crowding the trails. In addition, I’ve been taking lots and lots of immune-boosting vitamins…
Please remember we are in this together, so stay home, wash your hands often, and please follow social distancing regulations. There are so many people’s lives that depend on it, including your own, your families, and our first responders who are on the front line.  Additionally, these folks also don’t get enough credit, so hats off to all of the support workers, truckers, grocers, volunteers, and countless others who are out there making a difference to win this war. Sometimes the biggest heroes are those who are not seen and are able to make the sacrifices needed to stop the spread, like staying home. Are you going to be that hero?

Please be kind to one another and stay safe.  Super big virtual bear hug to all ~ Purpose“I have undertaken something very big. I have dared to dream. And act. Sometimes I am not sure.” - Mukta Singh-ZocchiHere is a story that I just posted on blog site...thepurposefulhiker.com Not Your Typical Covid-19 Response ~ by Mark ""Purpose"" WaligoraLet me first, and most importantly, start out by saying, I hope everyone is doing well, staying safe, and being kind to one another.  I haven’t written in a while, though honestly, I have a lot to write about. However, I was a recipient of some not so nice comments in response to a story that I posted in the AT Class of 2020 FaceBook group page. One of the comments that were made was, “wah, wah, wah, so you can’t hike, do you know that people are dying.”  It stopped me in my tracks when I read it. It frankly stopped a lot of things, it changed me in a way that I started second-guessing “MY” story. Was I selfish to continue to write about a dream during these trying times? Was I wrong to speak about my feelings of something other than what was happening during this pandemic? Was I being an inconsiderate asshole and a big baby…? 
Now, mind you that comments were made in a specific closed group. A group that only has one focus, one specific task, one dream, to some, of many years, which is Thru-hiking the AT in 2020.  Of course, most of us in this group know that not being able to follow this dream this year doesn’t even compare to the real-world tragedy that is Covid-19. However, this is a closed group, a safe place for us to talk about our setbacks and allow us space to “yes” wallow.  To express ourselves in a way that is not disrespectful to those who lost their lives, lost their jobs, and those risking their lives every day so that we can do our part and stay home. So was it wrong for me to have remorse for a dream that I had been chasing?  
To make this part short, I tried to reach out to these folks, as I wanted to actually call them to discuss my post, but the moderator of the group removed the comments and barred these people from the group.  But honestly, it was too late already, the damage to my heart was done. Words really do hurt, especially words without understanding. My dream to thru-hike and to search for hope and peace for a kinder world was shattered into a million pieces, stomped into the ground and spit on by people who don’t even know me. Or, even wanted to take the time to get to know me.  Maybe it was just me, maybe I shouldn’t let a comment bring me down. But it did, and I lost hope. My upcoming thru-hike was to do just the opposite, it was a way for me to restore hope, compassion, and to rediscover and grow my faith in humankind. I get it, “yes” people are dying, but I also feel that it’s “ok” for us to all have an outlet to the events lost that we all hold dear to our lives. A safe place to be able to grieve over personal events, while knowing that “yes” these are first world problems. 
Thank you to all of the heroes seen and not seen in this fight against COVID-19.  My heart truly hurts for those who lost loved ones, friends, coworkers, as one life lost is too many.  To those who have lost their jobs, struggling to pay bills, pay for food, and to make ends meet but please believe in America strong. We still have each other to lean on and we still have the support of our neighbors and our communities during these trying times.  There is no shame in asking for help, no shame in taking it if you need it, no judgment, no questions. It’s “ok” because when this is all over, we all know that you’ll give back to the world with gratitude, love, and compassion to humankind.
So, going forward I will write and it’s your choice to read it or not.  Just please understand that my heart in regards to our current world situation hurts just as deep as yours does…But it’s “ok” to discuss the suck and to also dream again. Because if we can’t do this in a safe place free of judgment, we will not grow and we’ll never Be_again.  With all my love ~ Purpose",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Sun",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628571,"Until I'm on trail, most of my entries to this page are stories that I write on my blog site thepurposefulhiker.com . Here is my latest post.Wait, What Month is it? - Mark ""Purpose"" Waligora After postponing my Appalachian Trail thru-hike in March, I started to fall deeper and deeper into the hole of depression and fear without even knowing it. Depression is sneaky, and it’s gradual. Slowly, the fear was growing inside of my head that my, and all of our reality will never be the same.  MEDIA, FEAR…Media, Fear…media, fear… As I was falling, my every thought was starting to spin out of control. The noise of confusion was getting louder and louder, yet everything in real time was moving so slow.  When will I hit bottom? Will I hit bottom? What will it look like? What will it feel like? Who will I be?  FEAR, MEDIA…Fear, Media…fear, media… SCREAM…I need to throw this F’ing TV off a cliff, I need to unplug again from all the panic-stricken media. Really? Murder hornets now, oh wait Yellowstone might also blow…whatever!
The media kept calling it, “The New Normal”. What does that even mean? This new reality, will it last forever? And why? I’m not going to get into the politics of everything that is happening now or then. It’s pointless, but responsible journalism doesn’t get ratings. You see, ratings equal revenue and what better audience do you have than one that is scared into a “Lock Down” with a message of doom, and despair. Sorry media, but I personally have hopes, dreams, goals, and I must climb out of this hole of fear because the phrase “The New Normal”, in my opinion, is just another “Bull Shit Story”.
So before you get all worked up and start trolling me. Delete…Delete… Yes, COVID is real. Yes, people have lost their lives needlessly. Yes, it’s cost people their livelihood, Yes, it has put many people on the front lines to keep this world spinning. Yes, COVID all around will be a horrible place in time in our history. Please, don’t get me wrong, there was and is some great journalism done on COVID, but their messages were lost in all of the fear-mongering and finger-pointing for political gain. In a time of despair, we the people need information without any political bias. Can we simply just have the honest truth? Remember, “We the people ”, as a society are in this together. The politicians, not so much…Ok, I hope you get my point, sympathy and compassion for all but I’m done justifying myself, life is also for the living. 
So, if you made it this far, thanks for continuing to read. I’ll get off the soapbox for now…
Please remind me again what month is it? June. How long have I been in this hole? Since March. I finally landed at the bottom of the hole in May and I wouldn’t say that I landed gracefully. We all have our moments, our slips, our falls. It’s called life, but it’s what you do when you hit bottom that defines your everything.  As I laid at the bottom of my hole and slowly opened my eyes, a ray of sunshine shone upon me. And it was then that I remembered a simple phrase, “everything happens for a reason”. I’d been blocking this message all along. I was caught up in all the drama and noise, only to fight it with anger and fear.  I didn’t allow myself to just embrace and feel these emotions and to put trust in the message of the Universe and grow from it, and climb out of the hole that I had dug. 
So, what does this have to do with hiking?  Everything for me, as I almost gave up on my dream to thru-hike the Appalachian trail…So, as I now stand on top of the hole that I fell in, I’ve never felt so alive, with so much hope and with new clarity to getting back onto the path to finding purpose. Stick around, things are changing fast for me, the adventure awaits no more. The mountains are calling to Be_again.
Mental health and mental health awareness have never been so important for us all. If you or someone you know is in need, even if the ego is blocking the ability to ask for help,  please find and seek the care that you or they need.  Not everybody can do this by themselves and it’s ok. It’s ok to ask for help, it’s ok to seek help, and it’s ok to get help.

Here We Go Again - Mark ""Purpose"" Waligora
Shift, Pivot, and Reshape are words that I’ve used before to describe how flexible we must be in this ever-changing world.  Most believe that our world is beyond our control, nor should we even try to control it.  Yes, we can influence change and make decisions for ourselves to improve our lives. However, to try and control the things that we cannot change is just preposterous, but yet I tried.  This life lesson hasn’t been an easy one for me to learn. Once I determined a path, deviating from that path was not an option, regardless of the circumstances, even in a worldwide pandemic. Learning still, I am, oh master Universe.
Flexibility is defined as a personality trait that describes the extent to which a person can cope with changes in circumstances and think about problems and tasks in novel, creative ways. This trait is used when stressors or unexpected events occur, requiring a person to change their stance, outlook, or commitment. – Wikipedia
If you’ve been following my blog, here’s my Appalachian Trail story timeline, in short. Flexible? Indeed!
May 2016: My dream to Thru-hike the AT was born.July 2017: My initial date was set to Thru-hike the AT in 2019.April 2018: Changed my plan to Thru-hike the AT in 2021.August 2018: Decided to move up the plan to retire and Thru-hike in 2019September 2018: Announced my 2019 retirement plan and my 2019 Nobo Thru-hike publicly.December 2018: Unforeseen family needs delayed my retirement and thru-hike. The announced new AT date, March 2020.All of 2019: Lots of hiking and hike preparation and taking care of my family of course.February 2020: Bittersweet retirement.March 2020: Postponed my start until June(Switch to a traditional Flip/Flop) due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ATC “closes” the AT.April 2020: Decided to postpone my start date until 2021 and back to a Nobo due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing trail-related complications.June 2020: Trail logistics related to COVID-19 are improving. The ATC will “reopen” the AT shelters, their offices, and volunteer trail maintenance and services will start in July.
On June 16th the Appalachian Trail Conservancy changed their position on thru-hiking for 2020. In a statement released on their website, the trail will open in early July; “Thru-hikers who left the Trail in March and stayed off to reduce the spread of the virus will have an additional 12 months to complete their thru-hikes once they resume their hikes after we’ve given the okay to return. If you’ve not started your thru-hike, then you have 12 months from your start date to complete your thru-hike.” Interesting…
With the news of the ATC’s changing its stance on thru-hikes, it got me thinking, what if I could get the best of both worlds?  Could I get on the trail, preserve my mental health, and just hike. Could I also get the trail community experience that I’ve heard so much about? Is there still a way under the new ATC guidelines to pull this off?  Maybe I need to Shift, Pivot, and Reshape…again. To unlearn what I learn takes constant practice, right?  
There were many reasons why, in April, I decided to just postpone until 2021. For me, the biggest concern, aside from the obvious COVID safety precautions, was that the trail community experience would simply not have been the same. “Same”, what does that even mean? I mean I’ve personally never thru-hiked the AT before so how can I even know what “Same” really is?  What about my mental health now, I mean who in the hell knows what will even happen next year either? Asteroids, aliens, zombies, murder butterflies?…LOL. 
I pondered over the thought and the answer was “YES”! Why wait for 2021? Introducing, which could quite possibly be the first of its kind, recognized by the ATC as a thru-hike: The Sobo2020/Nobo2021 Flip Flop Thru-hike. Hiker Trash, say what? Say, Be_again!
My Sobo 2020/Nobo2021 Thru-hike Itinerary:
1. August 2020: I will start southbound from Harpers Ferry, WV to Springer Mountain, GA (Southern Terminus). Harpers Ferry is kinda in the middle of the whole AT journey and is where the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters is located. At the ATC office, I will be able to register my attempt, get my thru-hiker number, thru-hiker identification tag, and I will get my picture taken on the porch of the office for the 2020 ATC registry book.  While the number of hikers on the trail will be reduced this year, starting this time of the year there is a chance that I’ll be able to meet up with hikers who have started their Sobo trips in June from Maine. The bonus in this plan is that I’ll get to hike into the fall colors through the glorious Smoky Mountains. There will also be milder weather patterns, and I’ll get to summit Springer Mountain in the end.
2. April 2021: I will start northbound from Harpers Ferry, WV to Mount Katahdin, ME (Northern Terminus).  With most thru-hikers starting in March/April, I’ll be ahead of what is called the bubble, which basically is a large group of hikers. While I’ll kind of miss that experience, I won’t have to worry about overcrowding on the trail, shelters, and at hostels when in town.  However, some folks do start in February, and also the faster March hikers could catch up to me around May. So, hopefully, I’ll be back in good enough hiking shape by then to be able to keep up with them.  I really want to get the social experience of this journey that the trail magically provides. So for me, the best part of this itinerary is that I get to finish in the traditional AT fashion by summiting Mt. Katahdin in 2021.

Anxious is the same emotion that I felt in March but this time it's different. This time it's also filled with anticipation. I've learned a lot about myself over that past few months as I navigated through a full spectrum of emotions, thoughts, and feelings, from the highs to the ugly lows during this ""life pause"". But much work still needs to be done.
On Saturday, August 15th, my wife, Jennifer, and I will make the 8.5-hour drive from Indy to Harpers Ferry, WV. The plan is to stay the night near Harpers Ferry so that we can take in some sights, relax, eat, and eat even more.  We'll also make a stop and visit the ATC Headquarters, which is now open, curbside that is. Looks like no thru-hiker badge for me, but then again it's just one more thing that I need to get over.

Until then, only 5 more days of hard training before I take a much-needed recovery break. My body needs it badly. We'll make a quick day trip to Chicago tomorrow to move our daughter into her apartment for year number two at Columbia College Chicago. Then later in the week, a much-needed glamping vacation with Jennifer and our other daughter in the amazing Indiana Dunes National Park.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629929,"I’m standing in a place I’ve been before, but this time it’s different. When I last stood at this spot, it was to announce the postponing of my March thru-hike start date, an emotional day for me in more ways than I could ever have imagined.  Yet, on that day I planted a seed of hope, a seed that was soon stepped on by some naysayers, and I almost gave up on thru-hiking the AT. As time and life forged on, it was with the support of friends, family, and followers, that I started to water that seed with my dream. Amazingly, that seed started to grow and blossom into reality.  
As I now stand at this spot today, on the eve of my AT journey, I can only wonder if I have what it takes to make it to Springer Mountain. I’m no stranger to these feelings as I’ve stood here in life before, wondering and contemplating everything. Whether it was my first Marathon, my first Triathlon, my first and only Ultra before RA changed my path in life, or the birth of our first child. I mean let’s be realists, nothing is more real than being responsible for another human’s life. So to walk into the unknown unprepared is foolish, but sometimes we don’t have that choice, and to face the unknown either way takes courage. To want to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail takes, well as my friends would say, takes a crazy person. I guess only miles and time will tell how my story will go.

1. Rained last night so first time packing up a bit wet.2. Light rain as I started to hike. Why do I have rain gear? Felt much better getting wet as I have quick dry clothes on. 3. Hiked in Sky Meadows State Park. Would be a cool place to see stars but you can't camp there unless your at the park camp ground. Was a bit made the side trail to the camp store was to far off trail to get a cold drink.4. While talking to a day hike i got stung by a hornet right in the leg...I killed that blank with my hiking pole right on my leg,  well after 10 hits...30  mins of burning pain before finally easing off.5. Met a couple of HF Sobo's, I'll say kids and their dog, whike eating lunch at the new Whiskey Hollow Shelter. Wish I could of stayed there.6. Saw my first snake, followed by two more throughout the day. Nothing rattling...6. Made it to my shelter after 12.4 miles and it was old a creepy looking.7. Take a Naproxen and pressed on for and 18.4 day. Not a bright idea.8. Met Water Fall a Nobo section hiker whom I believe is posting on TJ also, really nice guy.9. Stepped over a huge pile of bear scat on the trail, aka shit, so glad i didn't see that bear.10. Made it to the Jim and Molly Shelter at 6:30pm after a 8:00am start. Hangry, thirsty, dirty, and tired.11. Heaven in a solar spring shower complete with a bar of Irish Spring soap.12. Got free Fruit Roll Ups from another hiker at the shelter. 13. Nero tomorrow. 5.2 miles to the Mountain Home Hostel which I hear is plane awesomeness.

I was so exhausted last night that I crashed for a few hours then tossed and turned for the rest of the night. Tired...but can sleep. Two days ago I decided to book a room at Mountain House Hostel, cool place and great owners, so I can try and get my head around whats happening between my ears. Sleep deprived, hunger, hiking, filtering, hot, cold, wet, planning, calculating, so many new routines, it really is hard to understand what's happening day to day. You would think I'd figured it out walking all day, its complicated. In some ways a town break is good and bad. However, I need to resupply and I don't fully trust my hike plan so popping in and then out of town doesn't work for me yet. Especially when I and my clothes smell so bad,  so stinking bad, awful. What do I buy, how much do I buy for the trail, what will I want, I'm already sick of PB...Where do I eat, so many restaurants so many food options...Breathe...breathe...oh shit not again, mild panic attack. I'd be lying to you if I told you that this isn't hard in more ways than one. I can certainly see why hiking with others can be rewarding. I will get back on trail tomorrow I promise, I will enter and hike Shenandoah!

After an amazing fresh hot breakfast if wholegrain blueberry pancakes, fresh fruit platter, coffee, and ""YES"" OJ, it was time to dance up the trail into Shenandoah. Well dance that is until I got stung by a bee and yep in the same spot as the hornet sting, I guess my leg says sting here often please. Shenandoah has finally provided some views and I can see why hiking here in the fall color and thinner leaf coverage would be magical. Coming into the weekend there where lots of day hikers and families out and they were so much fun to talk to. So my first stop for the night is the Gravel Springs Shelter, where I ran into some familiar sobo faces. It's amazing how the trail provides when you need it. Not quite a tramily but really great people to hang with around the dinner table and looks like we may shelter hopping together for a little bit. Also in camp are 3 lady's on a shakedown for their thru-hike next year, a couple and their dog, and older women going nobo who's completed the PCT and JMT, impressive. We'll off to bed and the weather could get interesting tonight and tomorrow, fingers crossed as we dodged it this afternoon.

I guess you could say I was lucky as we had dodged the thunderstorms. The plan today was to shelter hop 13.1 miles up the trail but a couple of hikers I've been camping with needed to go into Luray, VA for a resupply and they where going to stay at the Open Arms Hostel. While I didn't need a resupply, I did mentally.  First stop on the trail the Elkwallow Wayside for lunch. I'm not going to bore you with food stores but it was nice to be able to sit at a picnic table and eat ""real"" not healthy food and get a cold Gatorade. After lunch I headed out first to get a jump on the other guys, they are much faster, to get to our pick up spot into town. The hiking w as hard through this part and then came the storm in more ways than one.  Yes it did storm, luckily again the thunder and lightning were distant but buckets of rain feel, soaked I was as it was way to hot to wear rain gear. As I pushed on, my body started to reject this hiking thing. My feet, toes, ankles, and knees are staring to hurt constantly. Which then starts to make your mind wonder. Why am I pushing myself, it was the first time that I really just wanted to stop. Soaked, mentally and physically exhausted I arrived at the pick up behind the others. I had a great evening hanging out on the porch with the guys and we talked wat to late into the night, ""Ok"" 10pm, about some pretty deep life topics, it was amazing how much was shared. I'm going to stop short on this for now...Tomorrow I'm going to slack pack back to the Hostel, I want to test out my everything...Goodnight and peace!","Gravel Springs Hut

He wears his heart on his sleeve an is so wise beyond his age.  A 37 old computer software engineer who walked away from it all to reinvent himself.

He's uber intelligent with a heart thats bigger than Texas, his home state...Three guys with such different backgrounds yet we all have one thing in common, finding purpose as we make our way down the trail. Thank you universe, thank you for this amazing journey.  So, for you hikers, I slacked pack today nobo and it was amazing. No pressure to pound out miles, today it was all smiles and then back to the Hostel where two of the guys zeroed. The trail along this section was hard, it's the AT it's all hard, but it had amazing views into the valley below.

Was a pretty easy hike today with a few views along the way and since it was short I took my time to just enjoy being out in nature. Well that's until I ran into my first time out hiking while in a thunderstorm. Ok, so it wasn't a hardcore lightning storm but there was a strike near by which prompted me to drop my hiking poles, drop my pack, and seek lower ground off trail into a lower gathering small trees as the sky opened up.  After a few mintues of sheltering while keeping and eye out for any widow makers I gathered my gear and swam down the trail to my pick up spot. I really need nature today but I'm tired. Back at the Hostel the guys were there so decided to grill some steaks, potatoes, and a huge salad with fresh off the vine vegetables it was amazing.

In nine days of hiking there's been a lot of ups and downs, and not just on the trial.  9 days is an amazing amount of time to think...and think I did. I've come to a conclusion that a thru-hike is not for me. There are many reasons why but mainly for me this journey is meant to be shared with others, and others I mean with friends and in more, less punishing, bite size chucks.  Yes, I've met great people along this journey and I will always remember the people I've met but we all have different timelines and separation will eventually come. The mountain terrain has punished my body beyond what I've expected, I knew it wasn't going to be easy, and hiking became a job that I, alone, was starting to not enjoy. It was really hard to make this decision but this is not kind of adventure I want. So, today I'm happy to join the section hiking club. Hats off to all of the thru-hikers past, present, and future, you simply are amazing. There's so much more to say that I will touch on when I return home. However, since I'm here in the now.

So the only real thing to report is that I got to tear out another page of my trail guide, progress? LOL.
