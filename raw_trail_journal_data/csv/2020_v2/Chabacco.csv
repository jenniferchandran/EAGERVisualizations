Chabacco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626137,"Our departure date is only ~75 days away and I have been doing some aggressive pack training lately as well as hitting the gym hard. Today, I did an 8 mile loop through the Gettysburg battlefield. Its a regular loop I have been doing 3-4 times a week with my fully loaded pack. While the terrain is flat (only about 500 ft elevation gain), the pace was brisk.  So far, all the gear is carrying well. The new La Sportiva Ultra Raptor shoes are comfortable as all get out, but I bought the largest size they make and these are borderline. I worry about my feet swelling in the first month and these becoming too small. But, but then, I will be into my Chacos. Can’t wait!  Lots of planning left to do, including setting up the charity site for Hope Walks  (www.hopewalks.org), the clubfoot ministry we will be walking to support. I have been planning out the details of the first month on the trail (where we will stay, resupplies and zero/nero days) and I feel a lot better about the planning aspect",,View Entry,"Jan 22, Wed",0
Chabacco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626138,"A little update: Sunday was my last trip to REI before we start the big hike...at least I hope it was my last trip! My wallet can't keep up this torrid pace and I know my wife is wearying of the constant gear upgrades. But, through some wise purchases, I have my base weight (everything except my food, water, and fuel) down to a little less than 20 lbs. However, I am planning on adding some other things back into the kit which will raise the weight. While these ""luxury"" items may be scoffed at by some, I am gonna take em and ship em back at Neel Gap if I don't feel they are worth it. The first item is my pipe. The second is my Helinox chair (a mere 1 lb for some serious break time comfort vs a rock or a log). The third is a Garmin inReach, an item I would not otherwise take except that I want to stay connected to family and to my daughter in the event she and I get separated and we have no cell signal.
Today's final trip was for my water filter and a headlamp. I chose the sawyer squeeze and came up with a brilliant idea...I have an old Katahdin base camp filter and the cartridge was shot. But, the bag is WAY nicer than the one that comes with the sawyer hang system. So, I am going to rig the sawyer inline in the Base Camp hose and just not use the filter in the bag. Using the quick disconnects that come with the Sawyer, I can simply pop it off and use it on my bottle when I am hiking, but use it as a gravity bag when I am at camp. This way, I avoid all the issues with the Sawyer bags leaking, etc. I also get a much nicer carry pouch that came with the Base Camp. Best of both worlds. Now I just need to practice the back-flushing on the sawyer. I hear that is the biggest pain with these systems. I bought some tablets as a backup purification method in the event this filter system clogs up or becomes unusable. The new Nemo sleeping bag I bought a few weeks ago has a little zipper pouch on it to store the filter so it does not freeze at night. Very slick option in my new sleeping bag.",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Sun",0
Chabacco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626140,"Today, I determined to take more base weight out of my kit. I was planning on taking my Osprey Atmos AG50. Its a fine pack and carries well, but is a bit weighty. I began shopping other packs and ran across an Osprey Exos 58, pretty much brand new for $100. I contacted the fellow through Facebook Marketplace and we struck up a conversation where he told me is is leaving this coming Saturday, Feb 15th. Taking Amtrak south and having Ron Brown drop him at the trailhead! Of course, I bought the pack! So cool sharing prep stories with a fellow Thru. Anyway, he told me he is an avid vlogger and already has a channel with many videos. His channel is ""Wild on the Trail""  (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQqg_BKrbiBBw5_3UJr01UA) and I already checked out a few of his videos. Fun guy with a great video presence. Cant wait to see what he is up to and follow in his steps only 2 months later. Good luck, Eric!",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Mon",0
Chabacco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626262,"With only 53 days left to departure, my daughter and I are trying hard to get pack training in. Today, we bulletproofed her back pack (a new Gregory Deva 60). She has had such a hard time finding a good pack that does not rub her wrong. A couple Ospreys really cut in to her back, but the Deva carried like a champ over the 8 miles we trucked today. While it's a heavy pack, it carries much lighter and we determined that her comfort is more important than saving a pound. Footwear has also been a winner for both of us (she in her HOKA Speedgoats and me in my La Sportiva Ultra Raptors). No hot spots, great grip. I do plan to switch over to Chacos as soon as we hit mid May though!I feel like a very blessed man to be undertaking this awesome journey with my girl before life gets in the way and she goes off in to the world. So many dads miss this because they are chasing careers or putting things in the wrong ""order"" in life. We will carry these memories a lifetime, no matter how many miles we get in to it.",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Sat",0
Chabacco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626378,"Another 8 mile training loop today. Feeling great! My body is getting stronger and stronger. Hills are a breeze and my time is down to about a 16 minute mile (almost 4 miles an hour with a 30 lb pack). Granted, aside from some hikes in Caledonia and the stair master at the gym, I can’t get in much elevation. But still, my cardio has come a long way and the legs feel terrific.
I did drop some more money on gear this week: an arc’terx technical fleece, a new pair of chacos (which my wife will ship to me when the shoe season is over at about Damascus Va), a CNOC water bag, a new pair of Fjallraven trekking pants and an osprey pack liner. I love gear, but man is this trip getting pricey! Pack weight is way down though. I should end up about 19 lb base and 30-32lbs loaded with 4 days food and a liter of water once it’s all said and done. This includes some luxuries like a Helinox camp chair (1 lb), a pipe and tobacco and a GPS device. I picked up a couple for McKenzie and I. For the reason, read on.
Some bad news came our way this week. A fellow not a lot older than me left for his long awaited AT through hike last Friday. The next day, he called 911. He was a little delirious, experiencing cramping and generally not in a good state of mind. He seems to have missed the Approach trail from Amicalola falls and instead ended up taking the Hike Inn trail. Regardless of the reason, he was lost and some bad weather was on its way. Search parties were sent out all week and they found his body on Thursday afternoon. Such a sad thing and a real wake up call for those of us undertaking this crazy adventure! Prayers to Eddie Noonkester’s family. From all accounts, he was a good man.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Sun",0
Chabacco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626765,"McKenzie, Naomi, Sarah, Mark and I hit the trail this weekend to test out our gear. The route was a 27-mile circumnavigation of the Trout Run Valley in West Virginia. It's an epic trip, for anyone looking for spectacular views, pulse-pounding climbs and scenic strolls through all sorts of varied terrain and ecosystems.
The weather started off very iffy on Friday night. We arrived to Wolf Gap parking lot at about 6:00 and it was actually sleeting! The wind was pelting us at 20 MPH with much higher gusts, making for an eventful climb to our first summit, Big Schloss at about mile 1.8. We stowed our packs at the summit trailhead and scrambled to the top. The wind was howling, sleet and snow blowing up the side of the mountain. Our thin fleece layers were not enough to allow us to hang out for too long. We grabbed some pics and took off back down the approach trail to regather our gear.
We hiked a ridge top for another 3 miles or so before dropping down into a valley above Pond Run. Just as dark was approaching, we saw some nice moving water off to the right of the trial and to the left, a nice campsite with a huge fire pit. We decided to not push on the extra 1/2 mile to our campsite and instead, make camp right then and there. Good thing too...I had left the house with a good cold/flu coming on and determined that, once I am on the AT, I will need to gut it out when I feel sick. But by the time I hit the campsite, I had a raging headache and could not get any food down. My throat and chest were tightening up too. So, While the others made freeze-dried meals in the maelstrom, I went to bed at 7:00... and barely slept all night. The temps were in the mid-twenties and with the wind, it felt much colder than that. When we all crawled out of our sleeping bags at 7:00 AM, there was a fresh coating of snow to enjoy while we made breakfast. I felt MUCH better after my fitful sleep and actually had no signs of the cold that had ruined my day 1 hike. We were packed up and out of camp later than we wanted to be, about 9:15, but we were slowed by the weather, wind and the lethargic feeling cold hands and feet seems to cause.
Saturday was a 10-mile hike with some serious inclines along the way. But, the valley views on all sides of us were stunning almost every step of the way, making the hike feel much shorter than it was. We logged the 10 miles in about 5 hours of hiking time (took a few nice breaks and a long lunch), so our pace, combined with the rigorous terrain, has me confident that the first few weeks on the AT, 10 mile days should be no problem at our 2+ MPH pace. Once we have the fitness to hike 9+ hour days, I see 15+ mile days being a normal thing within a few weeks of hitting the AT. We ended the day Saturday at a gorgeous meadow with a huge fire ring to enjoy. The wind had died and the temps had soared into the 50's, so we set up camp nice and early, leaving plenty of time to gather wood and finish camp chores. Some (Mark) even got in a nap in the sun. We got a chance to ensure all our Sawyer Squeeze filter systems (combined with our new CNOC bags) worked well and we were not disappointed. All worked fine. The night was beautiful. Full moon, tons of starts, not a cloud in the sky and not a breath of wind. It was fabulous. Temps dropped back down into the mid 20's while we slept, ensuring we woke to frozen water bottles. 
I slept fitfully but was the last one out of my tent at 7:30 Sunday AM. The girls had already started a fire and had their tents down, so the morning went quickly and we were on the trial by 9:00, but this accounts for daylight savings time which had occurred that night. We were greeted almost immediately by a 2.8-mile climb, very steep at times, to trout run road. This part of the hike was one of my favorites. The footpath felt like we were in the Whites of NH and the valley views were spectacular. We were walking on the edge of a hill most of the time, with steep precipices and hillsides on the down hillside, so it required that we pay attention as we walked. We hit Trout Run Road at about 11:00 and road walked the 2.8 miles to the entrance of Tibbet Knob Trail. We took a quick break there and then began the 1-mile ascent to Tibbet Knob, a spectacular break spot where we took our packs off and had lunch. We messed around on Tibbet Knob for about an hour (Mark took another nap), some of us tending to some foot issues. Naomi and Sarah were using new pairs of Hoka Speedgoat shoes which had led to some blisters on their inner heel that were a little concerning since we are running out of time to reassess footwear before we leave for the big game. A little leukotape and we were packed up and off again, descending back to our starting point at Wolf Gap Recreation Area. We arrived at about 2:00, meaning we had hiked 8 STRENUOUS miles in about 4 hours of hike time, so again, I am feeling REALLY good about our collective conditioning.
Let me talk about gear, for those who are interested: The Winners: I was particularly impressed with my Toaks titanium cook pot which doubles as a mug when combined with a set of ""hot lips"". This enabled me to ditch a mug altogether. In total, my cook set is half the size it used to be and about 7 ounces total. The MSR Pocket Rocket works like a charm. It does not heat water as fast as my Jet Boil used to, but it is a lot smaller and weighs less, so I am willing to make the sacrifice in boil time. It seems to use about the same amount of fuel. Another item I am pleased with is the Osprey Exos 58 pack. Super comfortable and never gave me any sense of discomfort. I was also really impressed with the Sawyer Squeeze water filtration system when coupled with the CNOC bag. Super light and when rigged as a gravity filter like my old Katadyn Base Camp, I was able to keep about 4 bottles worth of water hanging in camp for use while there. I can also just throw the filter on the end of a water bottle and use that way, but I get concerned about cross-contamination. I determined my best bet is to scoop water into the CNOC bag using a designated scoop and then gravity filter it into my two bottles. The La Sportiva Ultra Raptor shoes were great. No hot spots (until the road walk where one on my heel manifested itself, but it went away as soon as I got back on trail). I am a little worried that they are going to give me toe bang as my feet grow, so I may need to be willing to ship these home at Neel Gap f they prove uncomfortable in any way. I would really like to switch to the Chacos by the time I get out of the Smokies, but still weighing out the risk of bashing a toe. The Losers: If I have any misgivings at all about gear, it is with my sleep system. I was very cold, especially the first night, and I was wearing every piece of clothing I had. This shocked me. I am usually not a cold sleeper. The Nemo Ramsey bag, though rated for 15 degrees, felt chilly and confining compared to my Big Agnes bag (which I have found cold in recent outings with it). I could not splay my legs nor get comfortable. The Klymit pad felt thick enough, but I could not get comfortable on it. Lastly, the Nemo Dragonfly 1P tent felt too tight compared to my years of 2P tent use. The net result was that I slept terribly both nights, but was unable to determine if it was insomnia related to my illness or if it was simply an uncomfortable combination of gear (all of which is new to me, so that is a real bummer). I am not going to change these items out, instead intending to sleep at home a few times to see how things feel. Ultimately, I think I will move to a hammock set up once the weather is nicer and because the bag/pad/tent pieces I bought are so small and light, I will make them work for now. Still, after spending $500 on these items, I was hoping for a dreamy night's sleep and it never happened. If ONE thing were to pull me off the trial, it would be exhaustion caused by getting poor night's sleep, so I need to solve this.
All in all, a great shake-down trip and simply an outstanding weekend in general as the weather was epic and the route was fantastic. I highly recommend Tour Run Valley Circumnavigation for anyone in the PA/MD/WV/VA area. It was only about a 2:15 drive from our home in Gettysburg.",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Sun",0
Chabacco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632203,"Waaaaay back in March of 2020, my daughter and I were super excited to start our AT thru hike with a departure date of April 11. COVID had other plans and rather than get stuck out on the trail in the early and crazy days of the pandemic, we chose to push it off another year and start in 2021. While COVID is still a major issue (and the ATC is still not recognizing thru-hikers in 2021...not that we care), it looks to be smoother sailing, albeit with a much larger class of 2021 (if the trail registrations are to be believed). Still, this is our year. My dad passed away in November and I am hiking this for him as well as for myself. I need the spiritual and mental cleansing and am beyond excited to be back in the swing of gear tweaking, itinerary planning, and documentary watching. 
Couple of quick updates: 
First, our updated departure is April 8th. Watching the bubble to see f we can do earlier, but the trail just looks so dang packed this year I don't want to fight for resources nor be in too tight proximity with others while this pandemic is still making people crazy (and sick). Will update as needed.
Second, I am super excited to be meeting ""Wild"" (AKA: Eric Patterson from youtube's ""wild on the trail"") at a local cigar lounge in Gettysburg where I am hoping to reap some wisdom from him and hear firsthand stories about his adventure. While I think I have things pretty dialed in, I do want to ask itinerary questions, resupply questions, and questions about ""what would you do differently if you were to do it over?"". Really looking forward to seeing Wild again (I met him when I bought a back pack from him last February just a few days before he set off on his AT hike) and hearing his stories and hearing his passion for the AT come oozing out!
Last, some gear updates: I will elaborate on this more in future updates, but I switched up my sleep system to a hammock and am debating starting off with it (versus switching to it in Spring). I really like the sleep I get in a hammock and have been working on speeding up my set up time. I chose the Warbonnet Blackbird XLC and a superfly tarp with snake skins. If I intend to use it in the colder early going, I will probably add a travel sock to the mix as that seems to add about 15 degrees to the setup and I tend to sleep a little cold as I get older. The whole set up is heavier than my Nemo tent by almost a pound, but the better sleep combined with the ability to camp anywhere seems to offset the weight. But, I may start off as a ground dweller and bring my Nemo tent for the first month or so anyway just to be sure of warmth...I just hate the idea of limited camp spots in the early going when stealth camping will be so critical.  I have taken the hammock down to 26 degrees in a 15-degree bag and aside from a few cold spots I am trying to solve with a Gossamer Gear 1/4"" sleeping pad backer under my Thermarest Neo-Xtherm, I was OK. I think the travel sock would really make a big difference and negate the need to use an under-quilt (which removes my ability to go to ground if necessary for any reason and I will be hiking with my Brother in law who will have a 2 man tent). The only other thing I really switched were my shoes. I had been trail training in La Sportiva Ultra Raptors but found boot-bang on downhills. I tried to find them in a larger size as I love the shoe, but those pesky Europeans must have little doll baby feet because La Sportiva maxes out at a US 13.5 and they run SMALL as it is. The Ultra Raptors fit tighter than my size 13 Hokas and actually tighter than some of my other footwear in a 12! So, I began the search for a new shoe and resisted Altra's due to wearability issues (I prefer not to have to change out my footwear every 200 miles) and complaints of heel blisters on the newer models. Lo and behold, I discovered Topo TerraVenture 2's and love them. WIde toe box like the Altra's, low drop (3mm vs zero drop on the Altra), and a rock plate...and word on the street is they are super durable, far more so than Altra's. Done a bunch of hikes in them and am really impressed! These will be what I wear through the Smokies until the threat of snow and cold weather abates at which point I will probably switch over to my preferred footwear, the Chaco Z2's which my feet love to backpack in. Everything else will remain as it was last year. I dabbled with buying yet another pack to get my weight down (as well as the noise down as the Osprey Exos is a terribly squeaky pack) and took my Gregory Z65 on a couple runs to see if I liked it, but it is just too big. And, there is no sense in dropping $300+ on a Zpacks or ULA simply to save a pound or less. So, I will rock Mr Eric Patterson's Osprey Exos 58! Thank you, Wild! Look forward to seeing you next week at Union Cigar in Gettysburg!",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Fri",0
