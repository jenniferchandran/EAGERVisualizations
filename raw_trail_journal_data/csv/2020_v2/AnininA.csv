AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603251,"""Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today"" - Malcolm XI've knocked down 3 books about trail life. Ive got my guidebooks for 2018. Im researching gear and have tested out my hammock setup on cool temperatures. I've begun walking/hiking 3-6 miles a day and occasionally use the treadmill with a 50lb pack weight. I plan on talking with a few medical professionals and my brother who is an official Ironman about foot care. Gotta look into food on the trail because most of my experience has been with Backpackers pantry or similar and those things cost too much.I reached out to a 2000 miler from my home state for advice and am very thankful for his advice. He has offered to keep in touch and continue to answer my badgering questions. (Thanks Grant!!)",,View Entry,"Sep 19, Wed",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603325,"Grant recommended searching YouTube for some thru-hiking videos and I found the ""Hiker Trash"" series. They are longer but there is some good stuff in them. Also, they are funny. I cant help but wonder whats going through his mind as he interviews some of the hikers at the beginning of their trek.I've seen some of Darwins videos too. Also good. Not long ago I found a group on FB for a ""Class of 2020 Thru-hikers"" and joined. There seems to be some good people on there - I do wonder how many will actually be on the trail - I mean its a year away. Personally I feel really committed, mostly because my wife has given her approval but I have 3 kids all under the age of 7. So long as there isn't a 4th and there's no medical issues I'll be there in good spirits.I am keeping an eye on opinions on gear and think I'll be making some updates to mine, thankful I have time and look forward to sales around the upcoming holidays. I'll have to stop buying so many books!On another note, I packed my Kelty Redwing (not what I'll be using for my thru-hike) with a weight equivalent to 35lbs and have started ""hiking"" on the treadmill... with an incline. Most nights I'll walk 3-6 miles with a neighbor or two on the North Country Trail but decided it would benefit me to ""kick it up a notch"". Feels good and I know it helps me both now and in the long game. Logging for the night, time to go see how others are doing via the journals.",,On the Couch,"Sep 20, Thu",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603894,"I am excited but aware how far away 2020 is. In a way I see this next year as a mirrored journey of the AT itself. Recently I have learned of the website Lighterpack.com. I love this site! I have found numerous links on related AT facebook pages where others have shared their gear lists. I cannot tell you how thankful I am for those people. I actually posted a huge Thank You on one of the groups however since I didnt follow the exact rules of the group (having used a colorful background) it got removed. :( I think I will wait a little while and try again - without the colorful background. I've created my pack list although there are a number of items on it which I have yet to purchase. I've got a little over a year so I'm not really worried.This coming weekend I plan on getting measured for my backpack. I've been really excited about it and my brother is planning on going with me. I plan on ordering the Hyperlite 3400 Windrider and will reach out to their customer service and see if they will make me the windrider in their DCH150 material in white. They make the pack in black but I really prefer the white as I think it will be easier to see items in the dark. I also tend to think if someone is going to steal a pack they have a greater desire for the black being more rare, than the white. Either way, I like the white over the black.The short list of items I still want to purchase include the pack, a chameleon hammock, top quilt, underquilt, tarp and water filter. It sounds like a lot and in reality they are the more expensive items. Also the most important.... which is why I am willing to shell out big money on them. In the end I justify these costs knowing I will begin my AT hike with good physical strength and really good gear. The only other aspect I feel I can control is mental strength. Which brings me to the newest book arrival, ""Appalachian Trials"" by Zach Davis.The book came recommended by Grant, the thru-hiker who has been answering my questions. He shared this was the only book he read prior to starting his hike. I haven't started reading it though, I have started working a side job to help cover expenses. I work in the evenings because the kids fill my mornings and afternoons. No complaints, its a wonderful life, challenging and tiresome at times but that's life and I recognize how wonderful I have it.I do wonder if my motivation will run out. I tend to jump all in and then run out of steam. I have felt that on occasion already and have simply taken a ""zero"" day in prep. This next year is my mental hike. Its going to be long and challenging and I feel like with the right amount of preparation the hike itself ought to be less stressful. I get a little stressed on gear hear an there but am happy to satiate it by buying a new piece of gear, like sock liners, here and there. I carry a 33lb backpack occasionally during the morning and daytime to get accustom to the actual weight as well as getting accustom to waking up and putting it on. The later is certainly more challenging. Its the realization that I dont HAVE to do it, I can skip a day or two or three. But its sharpening my mind to understanding what trail life will throw at me.
This is my third journal entry. I believe that means its about to go public. Its a little frightening, mostly because its over a year away and I tend to think most people are writing journals of their hike... not preparation for a hike. Whatever. This is it. HYOH.",,View Entry,"Oct 02, Tue",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604028,"I have pulled the trigger on 2 big items for my thru hike: An Enlightened Equipment top quilt and an under quilt! I'm pretty excited. For the UQ I choose the Revolt 950 fill,10°F. I have heard amazing reviews about EE's equipment and am stoked to test it out this winter. I also ordered their TQ, the Revelation 20°F. I dont plan on carrying them both the entire hike but I do plan on starting in February so I want to make sure I stay warm.On another note I finished another book, ""Appalachian Trials"" by Zach Davis. This was a great book. I cannot even tell you how many times I was highlighting something but it felt like it was every page. I remember stopping myself at one point thinking I was highlighting too much... I flipped back a few pages and pretty much confirmed there was something of value on nearly every page. Screw it, it's my book and I think its important enough to highlight so I continued. If nothing else it serves as a reminder to what I found of value to any family members who may wish to read it while I'm out hiking. Or more likely when I revisit this book next year because this IS a book worth revisiting. For those who have also read the book I will admit I have not actually wrote out my 3 lists. I was too enveloped in the book to put it down and do it. I will be creating my lists though and will likely post them in this journal. I want to put some real thought into them and into writing it down. I have thought about it and have my basic reasons for it but sometimes its difficult to put into words. No to mention the space he provides in the back of the book doesnt provide adequate space - I tend to be wordy (what can I say? I find great value in words and using the most appropriate ones at that).I have been contemplating water filtration. Currently I have used a Katadyn 1 gallon base camp gravity feed system. I love it. I have always been a fan of Katadyn, in my opinion they are the pinnacle of water filtration. The base camp is bulky though. When I hiked through the Porcupine Mtns in Michigan's UP, a friend brought his Sawyer squeeze. He offered and I accepted, to leave my fiter at home and just use his. I wasn't a big fan of it. Filling the bag sucked. Squeezing the bag sucked - I felt like I was going to pop it (and I have heard about bags exploding at the worse possible time). The filter itself worked great and the bag never burst. The weight... amazing. So I have broke down and ordered one, however I dont plan on using the Sawyer bags. Instead I will test both the Cnoc bag and a Evernew bag. Neither bag gets what I would consider ""great"" reviews on Amazon. The Evernew percentage of 4 and 5 star reviews is only 73% while the Cnoc has a combined 67% rating for 4 and 5 stars. Sawyer squeze is at 91% (Katadyn pocket micro is 94%). For the price and weight its worth testing the Sawyer. I'm also tossing around the idea of buying a 2L bladder and moding it to work with the Sawyer but I dont know that its worth the effort or if I would trust my handiwork to hold up for months on end. Katadyn does have the ""BeFree"" system and I may try it but the reviews are across the board and after reading through the reviews it seems when it breaks, its not the bag but the filter itself. Katadyn, you need to step up your game cause I want to take you with me but your hefty. And expensive. And your stuff that isnt hefty or expensive appears to suck. Sorry. I've loved you and will continue to use the base camp for shorter hikes. If you wanted to send me a free Befree system to test out I'd give it a go (I have a year and will put both systems through the ringer).Alright. Time to start a list. Good night.",,View Entry,"Oct 04, Thu",0

I feel like its where I belong. It provides me with the solitude needed to reflect on my actions in life. This time is rare for me because of my three children. There is no doubt I will miss them but feel like I must go to become a better father. Not just in a self improvement manner but in recognition of the support and love they provide to me. This, this is something I need to recognize more in my life. As a professional parent who is always giving, always providing for the needs of my family I forget the support they also provide to me.

AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604587,"I am stuck between full throttle excitement and preparation and being fat and lazy. This early in the game (NOBO 2020) I feel likes its totally acceptable. That being said I like to read my AT books and watch AT documentaries. Each one gives a little different perspective or a new angle.Beneath the Dirt is a documentary (?) by a young woman who invites her brother and a close female friend to thru hike the AT. Its does a great job showing the struggles of hiking in a group. That being said, it makes me want to hike with the AT with my brother. I am the youngest of two. My older brother has always been an inspiration in my life. Not long ago I found a letter I wrote as a young child, telling him he was me hero. His life has been much more challenging in the last few years than mine has but in many ways they have brought us closer. We both have kids and the normal life distractions so being able to grow our friendship/relationship has been great. The documentary helped me to realize that while siblings fight and argue, we will always want whats best for each other. There are very few people in the world that will always what you to succeed.I dont know if he will join me and my gut says no, but I did mention it to him. Its a year away so who knows. Like most people, there is a struggle to let go of what we know and step out into the unknown. To leave behind familiar and chart a new course. And the magnitude of that choice is significantly greater when you have kids and bills and so on. For me, these are part of my reasons to go. I need to understand that magnitude. I need to go out into the wild and discover the greater part of who I am so that I can return to my family and be that better version of myself. I know its in there, its just buried beneath the dirt. (I just thought of that while typing so Im really pleased with myself right now for tying this all back in - a great note to end on!!)",,View Entry,"Oct 17, Wed",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604954,"Pretty excited to receive my EE under quilt and top quilt! They look great and feel extremely light. It does make me wonder how warm they will keep me but everyone I have talked to said they will do the job. I will have to test them out in the yard to make sure.  Also of note, I got my backpack ordered. I hesitated to order it so soon but I want to get a feel for it. Its kinda felt like Christmas around here lately. I've got most of my gear covered - the exception is my hammock and tarp. I have read enough reviews of Dutch's chameleon that I plan on popping for one of those. I love the integrated system Dutch offers and haven't been too happy with the bugnet on my current ENO. For the tarp Im planning on Zpacks tarp for hammocks, with doors. Once these get ordered I will have all my bases covered and plan to spend 2019 testing and tweaking it for 2020. It seems so far away.Currently I am researching clothing and diet related items. My base-weight is at 15.5lbs which I am happy with. There are a few items I have not accounted for so I will continue to look for ways to reduce weight. All in all my current baseweight includes my winter gear so I anticipate a lower baseweight as warmth returns to the trail. My winter gear weighs in at 3.75lbs with a good portion to be swapped out for a slightly lighter summer gear. For example my cold weather quilts would be exchanged for summer quilts not much weight but every bit counts.Along with clothes and diet, I still have to test out foot gear. Id like to have a backup set (or 2) of broken in shoes I can have sent as needed. My game plan is to build a couple of totes with gear, food etc and have it organized so I can phone home and have my wife find and mail supplies. I like to keep things organized and I think it will serve its purpose when the times comes. For now it keeps me focused and reduce redundancy.",,View Entry,"Oct 30, Tue",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605531,"It has been a while since I've posted an update. Still preparing for a 2020 NOBO. My HMG windrider has arrived and as of today ordered a tarp with doors for my hammock. No new reading on the AT and no new documentaries... I've watched a couple here and there on YouTube but nothing really new or necessarily ""noteworthy"". We got 6-8"" of snow here in Southern Michigan this week and my wife thought I was crazy I mentioned setting up my gear and camping in the backyard. SHe may be right. Night temperatures are in the low 20's so with a February start at Springer I think this ought to be on the coldest end of the spectrum I would face. Im also trying to convince a few family and friends for a weekend winter hike here in Michigan but again, most just look at me like I'm crazy. I LOVE the snow and winter time. The beauty found during the winter season is not comparable to the beauty of any other. Finding others who also appreciate it is pretty rare though.Just a couple other pieces of gear wanted for the thru-hike. Warm weather quilts and Dutch's chameleon hammock.. I may have mentioned the hammock a couple of times to my wife and have kept my Christmas wish list very short (specific) to increase odds.Food for the trail doesnt sound too bad. Im torn between relying on resupplies in town and packing/mailing things. Since I tend to be more of the ""shoot from the hip"" I am leaning towards simple resupply in town but then there are items like vitamins, probiotics... those things that you really like to have (as you get older) because it helps keep your gut balanced. The struggle is real when you start staring down the big 4-0. Im not staring down 40, its a few years away but I have been pretty hard on my body and know/feel it. Probiotics and vitamins... Im just missing one of those weekly pill boxes. Tonight is date night with the Mrs.Cheers!",,View Entry,"Nov 27, Tue",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605898,"Life can throw some challenges!! We've had our washing machine and dryer break this month. On top of that we had our chimney cleaned today only to find out there has been a chimney fire and the entire flu is cracked and needs replaced. Now there are many ways I can look at this but Im going to try to stay positive. By having these things break now, I am here and able to help my family fix them. It would be much more stressful for my wife if I were on the trail. By getting these things fixed now, its highly unlikely they will break while I am away. So while it sucks to have things breaking, its better they break now than while I am away, and it ought to provide some comfort and security as well.A big portion of preparing for a thru-hike, that no one really talks about, is getting your house, family, and current living situation in order prior to leaving... so Im going to chalk this up as trail preparation and keep moving forward.",,View Entry,"Dec 14, Fri",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605949,"So like most people preparing for a thru-hike, one tends to immerse yourself in different groups and websites to learn as much as possible, prepare as much as possible, etc. I had a moment the other day where I just had to laugh out loud... another potential 2020 through hiker shared a new piece of gear that came in and how, for them, it was beginning to feel ""real"". I really did have to chuckle as my mind just couldnt take it. We are over a year away and quite frankly, for me, I dont think its going to feel real until I walk under the archway or Im at least a month into it.At this point, with around 14 months to go, I'm trying to set a pace for the long game. I want to throttle my excitement down and prevent premature burnout. Nobody likes busting prematurely.... So how am I trying to stay motivated. Well tossing up a post like this is one way. Practicing a few trail habits is another way (setting up and tearing down my gear, packing and repacking) but really Im focused on spending quality time with my kids. A few days ago my eldest daughter (4yo) had a moment where she said she didnt want me to go. It was heartbreaking. It took me by total surprise. She has been asking me to setup her hammock on and off for a week but because our washing machine and dryer are broke we are drying our clothes on a line in the basement where we would normally hang them. I explained this as well as I could to a 4 year old but obviously there are some things shes picking up on and its impacting her. She will likely be the one who takes it hardest while Im gone. Shes also the one, who outside of myself, will have a birthday while Im on the trail.If you completed your thru-hike and left a family of littles behind, please leave me a note on things you did to ease the heartache while away. Im planning on sending lots of post cards and expect to meet up with them somewhere on the trail at least once. Any other ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",,View Entry,"Dec 18, Tue",0

AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618604,"Recap of my first shakedown hike.We left May 14th and arrived at Quality Inn in Daleville/troutville. After a nights sleep and a continental breakfast we caught a ride with Homer to the trail at VA 621. Homer was great and I'd highly recommend his shuttle service. He does a lot of trail maintenance and knows the ins and outs of the trail.The first day consisted of a little over 8.5 miles taking us to Pickle Branch shelter. The water source was flowing - but getting there was a jaunt. Down a bunch of steps - what felt like half a mile. Haha. I met a few thru-hikers, day shikers and section hikers as well as one guy who is also planning to start a thru-hike next year. He was out for the day to test out his new pack - an HMG southwest. We chatted and commented how we have liked our packs so far and ook forward to next year. He wont be getting on the trail until his son get married and I dont believe I will meet up with him on the trail but you never know.From Pickle Branch we hiked 7 miles to the Four Pines Hostel. It was a good day and my first experience staying in a hostel. I remember walking up to the property and seeing Guinea hens and thinking, Oh no. I hate those things - they are SO obnoxious. They ended up not being a problem for me. I hung my hammock up in his back garage and the Guinea's decided to bother the ground dwellers instead. Bonus! :)  In the evening we drove the van up to the Homeplace and enjoyed supper. It was good but I think I could have ate more. I was at a table with others from the hostel, most thru-hikers, about 8 of us I think. If I return I believe a table of 4 would be better. The following day rained. It was great! Im sure most were a little downtrodden from the rain but its what I was hoping for on my shakedown. And it only rained for a couple hours before tappering off. I decided on this day I needed to stretch my legs and go at my own pace instead of the pace of the group. Side note: rain pants suck. I put them on for like 20 minutes before removing them. We headed to Catawba Mtn. Shelter, 8.5miles and I arrived by noon. I setup the hammock and relaxed as I waited for the group to get to camp.  The privy door was knocked off and was infested with a billion mosquitos. Catawba is a hopping place on the weekend.I wanted to get up on Mcafee Knob for sunrise. its 1.7miles from the shelter and I was averaging 2mph. A storm came through overnight and was gone just as quickly. My tarp, hammock, everything worked great. I set my alarm and went to bed. In the morning, I was up before my alarm by about 15 minutes. That saved me because I didnt consider the time it would take to tear down. I didnt top off my water at night and there wasnt a source nearby. I felt short on time and busted my butt to get going in time. I was certain I was going to miss it and at one point turned and photographed the moon because I didnt think Id make the sunrise. As I neared I noticed a sign for an ""overlook"" and decided it was the best I was going to get... turns out that overlook was in fact McAfee Knob. Oh man, so glad I stopped, I made it just in time.I crossed through Tinker Cliffs on this day also and ended the hike back at Lamberts Shelter. This is where I saw snakes. Lots of snakes. I saw 3 snakes while hiking, most rat snakes, and 1 brown snake right by the shelter. I met some really nice people here including a small group of Amish from Ohio. One fellow thru-hiked last year (Duo) and was happy to share his experiences with me. This night I decided to sleep in the shelter - side note: shelters suck; I should have stayed in my hammock. I didnt have a pad or anything even close to comfy to sleep on... So I didn't really sleep.In the morning I was up and out before most of the others. Im a morning person and enjoy the quiet they provide. I see a lot more nature in the morning too. The mornings hike brought me back to the car we had left at Valley Cleaners in Daleville, about 9.4miles. As I sat waiting for the others in my group to hike out, I was took stock of the shakedown. I made mental notes about pacing myself, nutritional deficits that needed improving and overall condition of my health. I consider it a complete success. I hope to see McAfee knob at sunset for my thru-hike next year, nut maybe I'll stay at the shelter that is .5 miles AFTER the Knob instead of 1.7miles prior.",,View Entry,"May 14, Tue",0

Thank you to all who have stopped by and commented, it seems many share similarities in lifestyle and have hiked the porkies! YES! I am still planning a thru hike, registered to start Feb 23, 2020. I have not updated in a while, my apologies, I wanted to take a brake and follow a few who are hiking now. A lot has happened since my last post. I took a week long shakedown hike and completed the Virginia triple crown with a friend who is section hiking the AT. McAfee Knob was amazing! I will post a recap of my shakedown later this week. Gear updates! I pulled the trigger on a 0° under quilt from UGQ (on sale) and have also picked up a couple pieces of cold gear layers half off. Really excited but it feels weird buying winter clothes in the summer. I feel like I've got all my bases covered and it's become more of a waiting game. Waiting for winter to arrive to see if I can leave earlier or if I need to back up my start date. I can endure the cold much easier than the heat. I've always said you can always put on more layers but can only take off so many. I just crash in the heat and if/when the heat comes on in planning on mapping in the peak afternoon hours and will pick up those miles in the evening. Thanks again to all who have left comments, they are very helpful!",,View Entry,"Jul 10, Wed",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618691,"Preparing for my 2020 thru-hike gets me so excited some days, anxious other days and its usually that frustrating feeling of hurry up and wait. I imagine the compounding feelings will really hit home after the New Year and then hit full force at the archway at Amicalola Falls.I am not one to quickly wish away summer, I enjoying spending quality time with my family. As a professional parent I spend most of my day with them but knowing I will be away next summer makes this one more important to me. Just scheduling my hike has already assisted me in engaging in more play with my kids.I'm reading through ""Nothing is Impossible"" by Christopher Reeve and he touches on getting comfortable in life, how our comfort can create a numbness. I'm going to suggest that when we are not pushing ourselves to improve, to learn new things we slip into a sedentary state and lose those intentional actions. Those are the actions which make us alive, instead of floating along and taking life as it comes we must be out sculpting life, carving the waves of lifes' decisions to pursue happiness.My kids will jump on the trampoline for hours and then run around and playing tag, then over climbing the dirt pile, they just keep moving. I think this is why so many parents and adults take breaks: kids rarely stop moving. And there's nothing wrong about taking time to recoup, I'm not saying that. What I am saying is take your break but don't get lost and absorbed in something else and forget to re-engage.As this journey takes me away from my family I plan on coming back a better father, husband, person. I wouldn't be going if I didn't believe it would help me become a better person. Furthermore I believe it will help my family become better also.My signature line is to expect nothing and discover everything and I use that to prevent myself from expecting to have the same exact experiences others have. I do not expect to see the same views at the same time of year with the same weather. I do expect to learn new life lessons, maybe revisit past lessons, meet new people, challenges and over all process much of what has already occurred in life. This hike is my planned mid-life crisis and so I expect a lot of internal conjecture (hopefully without much argument, haha).",,View Entry,"Jul 13, Sat",0

I remember talking with the gal I hiked the VA triple crown with, we live in the same general area and met at a monthly North Country Trail meeting, both as guests. She was guest speaking to promote a local adventure club and I was interested in the trail. I live less than half a mile away. That's the back story; Here's the meat and potatoes: while driving the VA we spoke about how much more populated the AT is over the NCT and I remember commenting how I would be interested in offering our homestead as a hostel if people thru-hiked the trail. She replied maybe no one hiked it because there wasn't support. It resonated with me and after some discussion with my wife we offered to be trail angels and posted online.Now I hike my area of the NCT pretty regular and its RARE I see another hiker. I dont think I had ever actually met anyone hiking through, hiking thru the whole trail or even just the state. Well the NCT and the the local chapter both shared our post and last night we met our first thru-hiker. We picked him and his pup up. He dropped his pack, setup his tent and the slack packed a few more miles. That evening I picked him back up, we ate, shared some stories and crashed. French toast and sausages for breakfast and then we dropped him off where he had completed the day priors hike.My kids and family learned what its like to offer support to a hiker and it felt good. Through the process I learned he was also planning to thru hike the AT next year!

AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621401,"I have made my reservations at the lodge. The plan is set and in forward motion. I am so very happy to have my brother beginning this journey with me! Hes driving me down to GA and will hike the approach trail and maybe a couple days more with me. While I know I'm still a ways out (188 days), I feel like momentum is increasing. I have my logs created and going, I have my gear, I've tested my gear, I got different gear and tested that too. I'm registered and have booked my first couple nights. I've got a plan for cold weather and I am adaptable. My wife was excited with me when I shared I made my reservations in Amicalola. The dominoes of time are beginning to drop as well. In a couple weeks the kids' new school year is beginning, autumn will come shortly after that and then winter. With the holidays I'm guessing time will start going by even more quickly. I cherish the time I have, the time I spend with them. It's difficult to put into words why I want to do this sometimes, I don't see this as a hike, it's far more a journey, a pilgrimage. I feel a weight in the time I've spent preparing, it propels me forward. Little things I've done, tiny changes I've made, they are coming together and I'm excited to see it begin. I'm also happy it's still 188 days away: I've got things to do before I go. I want to make sure my family knows I love them, appreciate their support and will return upon completion. Upon completion.",,View Entry,"Aug 19, Mon",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624961,"I hit 100 days back on Friday, today marks 97 days!Ive had a ton of mixed emotions as of late, including a season of second guessing myself. I'm not going to lie, nearing the 100 day mark had my stomach in knots. I have the majority of my gear but havent put in much effort into exercise. I understand the trail will train me but I want to be in good position to begin, to be in good physical condition to adapt to the struggle instead of needing to overcome numerous physical challenges to be able to survive.I want to enjoy the hike as much as possible. So last night I setup my gear and spent the night outdoors. Temps dropped below freezing and I needed to work on my cold weather layers. I went to sleep at 9:30p which was right after putting my kids to bed. I knocked out pretty quick and woke around midnight to a slight draft and coyotes howling. After posting in Hammock Forums, I was advised to snug up the foot end of my UQ. The draft came from underneath and only when I shifted my sleeping position. I made it through the night and was pretty warm most of the night so I'm feeling pretty confident. I have a set of down booties on order with EE and have some warmer leggings on my wishlist for Christmas. 97 days. Michigan snow has been falling and while there are some warm days ahead, I know that I will be leaving for GA when there is still snow on the ground. Add in holidays and I imagine the days will start snow balling and BAM, single digit countdown is here.On another note, I have been having some panic/anxiety issues. haha. I laugh only because I should have expected it but then here it is and Im caught off guard. Its like missing the alarm clock in the morning - OH CRAP, its getting real!  So they pass quickly but it has been happening. I imagine its fairly normal. I also imagine as time gets closer, my diet is going to be impacted. I get bound up before a hiking adventure, also something i imagine is common, but am wondering how this epic journey will hit me before I hit the trial. Why would anyone do this??? It must be worth it. I am so thankful to have this opportunity. Already meeting parts of the community of hikers associated with the AT and already feeling blessed to know them and have their support. SUPER excited to actually meet and walk with many.#Aninina2020",,View Entry,"Nov 18, Mon",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624968,"So after going over my underquilt issue I discovered a few different things needing attention. First, i realized I had not run my UQ through the channel lock thingy on my hammock.. thats a technical term... but it keeps my hammock and UQ working together and would explain a cold draft while moving. I also remembered the last time I used it I had loosened the ends of the UQ, around the collars. You know what though? I made it through the night and figured it out. A big shout out to Daniel DeMar - who while asking a question about my setup, I linked a video from a 2019 thru-hiker, Frozen (some great videos) and when I watched it again I realized I had forgot some drip lines. Also worth mentioning, Brian Cuprisin, Thanks for the great idea of using rain pants to assist in a drafty hammock - that little nugget will come in handy while on the trail if I run into something like this again.So I knocked all my tweaking out this morning and Im just about ready for another night out in the cold. Im going to wait for my sidekicks though, because those just look and sound awesome.Thanks for reading and keeping me focused on progress.",,View Entry,"Nov 19, Tue",0

AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625606,"Sitting here waiting. Since our confirmed childcare provider cancelled on us I feel like I am back to square one. Outside of the obvious cost to paying childcare, I am starting to understand why few people my age thru-hike the AT, or any trail for that matter. Still, we have found a professional service which believes they can find candidates for us in an acceptable amount of time. To me, that amount of time is getting smaller as next month I plan to begin and I am losing sleep over it.I woke early this morning and my mind has been wrestling with the unfinished projects around the house. With less than 50 days before I leave for my hike, these unfinished projects haunt my mind with failure. ""If you cant finish this then how can you finish that?""
I am trying to stay focused on the positive side of things and answer myself simply with: One step at a time. Execute an action, however small it may be and enjoy the accomplishment. Repeat. It's not the size of action that counts, its the pattern created.Sounds good right? Fake it until you make it? Whatever. I think a big part of life is realizing there will always be something to do, something needs finishing. Priorities. Balancing priorities. Balance. Stay engaged with where I am.

AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626168,"Well it might just be the last time I use the Entry type ""Pre-hike""; only 8 days until my brother and I head to Springer Mountain. A few updates: we have childcare squared away - this was the biggest relief. I was literally worrying myself sick over this and once we got a solid commitment so much stress just fell off my shoulders. This morning I emptied all my gear on the floor, laid it out, took a picture and then packed it all up again. I weighed a couple of items previously not on my winter list and shortened a couple of straps. My winter baseweight it heavier than I would like but I think its a common problem. Fully loaded with 4 days food and 2 liters of water weighs in at 28lbs. Winter baseweight is 17lbs; my lighterpack link for those interested is:  lighterpack.com/r/u6p3woI love my HMG Windrider for numerous reasons but my favorite reason is because I can write/draw on it. On a shakedown last year I remember running across a fellow with a white HMG pack and he had thru's sign it. Neat idea. I dont anticipate having others write on my pack but I have customized it with a few very special markings. I will ""unviel"" it once on the trail, probably on my Instagram account (Instagram.com/aninina_adv)While it sounds like I'm self-promoting it's not my intention. Lately, I've felt a little behind the curve on social media and Im trying to catch up... Im not even a Boomer!! hahaWe (wife & I) have been making little changes with our kids to ease the transition. So this week our kids have started riding the bus to and from school. Next week the nanny begins. We've had a lot of discussions about the trail, visiting each other and expectations. I recently sat down with my two older kids to discuss the trail and my time away, it was emotional - as expected - however both said they still wanted me to go hike. This caught me off guard. In fact my daughter was insistent that I go. She wants to come visit and prefers her mom to put her to bed at night. My son was a little more mixed, probably because he has a better understanding of how long 4-6 months is.As if we needed an example, my wife had to travel all of last week for work, so all the kids had some understanding of time away and how long a week without a parent is. It was difficult, we didnt communicate with Mama while she was gone either. We all had some time in tears which was discussed and reiterated as normal and perfectly acceptable. My kids. They are awesome. Always in the forefront of my mind. Have I mentioned how awesome my wife is??? Wow. This year we celebrate 16 years of marriage.  I am fortunate. She is by far the most important, the most significant part of my hike, of my life. Thank you hun, I love you.""In case of doubt, push on just a little further and then keep on pushing"" - George S.

AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626208,"Working on my food bag this morning. I am an up and at 'em kinda person and if its cold in the morning I dont plan on sticking around camp to make breakfast. I'd rather pack it up and head North, snacking on bars, bagels or gels as I go. I also tend to collect water before bed so Im not fiddling with it in the morning. Nothing like slipping into a cold creek first thing in the morning - no thanks. Over the last few days I have been removing coffee from my routine as well. Don't get me wrong, I love my coffee but it can seriously dehydrate my body and starting a long distance hike dehydrated is asking for trouble. Id rather go without for a while and re-evaluate down the trail, maybe save it for town visits, maybe not.I am hoping to take a healthier approach to trail food however it really comes down to resupply options. Resupplies are kinda my last unknown, never having hitched or relied on someone else for food. I cook for our family, I've cooked professionally, its a hobby of mine that I enjoy so while on the trail I'd like to keep that flair alive. I dont really know what that will mean once in the thick of it but I'll figure it out. I'm not opposed to carrying a few McDonald's sandwiches or a family pack of tacos from Taco Bell. Outside of the sleep system, food is the next big thing, imo, worth its weight. No, McDonald's and Taco Bell aren't what I would call nutritious but certainly could fall under ""comfort food"". NOTE: I listened to a podcast from a PCT hiker who carried like 20-30 burgers from McD's and his suggestion was to separate the buns from the meat as they get soggy after a couple days back on the trial. The last few days I havent been nervous or anxious. I have really felt at peace with everything. There may be trails ahead of me, for myself and family but I believe we will endure them with great success. With my brother driving down and hiking with me I know I am stepping off strong. I do want to make sure we make his schedule - reaching Neel Gap in 2 days maybe 2 1/2 days time. After that I can move at my pace, whatever that may become. Time is on my side. I've got a couple of people ahead of me by about a week I would really enjoy meeting.Watching the weather. This is annoying. There is nothing to be done about it but I cant stop looking at it. Michigan is cold right now, last nights was 0°F and today's high is 20°F. Georgia should be at least double that, right? Well lets hope so. Cold is okay. Wet is okay. Cold and wet, not so much.It will be what it will be.6 days to departure.",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Fri",0

I am touched by the support and kind words you have shared.Tomorrow I leave for Georgia. Stoked to have my brother driving me down - his support has been amazing. Doc from the class of 2019 has also been supportive and guiding me with his experiences on trail. Tribute, also from the class of 2019 has been an amazing support - its hard to believe I was following his hike last year and now here he is supporting my hike. This AT community is already reminding me of the kindness humans can show each other. I so look forward to hiking with each of these guys and so many more as I move North.I feel prepared. Everything needed to be done has been completed. My gear is set. My body is rested and ready. Support is in place. A facebook memory from a year ago came up in my feed this morning, a picture of the full snow moon setting above Katahdin. It reminded me how long I've been preparing. Quitting is not an option. It never was and it will not be. It can't be. Progress can be slow, pauses are a part of the journey, keep moving forward. In the moment of weakness, hold your ground, it will pass and then we move forward again.Good luck and godspeed class of 2020, tomorrow I join you on the trail.#aninina2020",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Wed",0
AnininA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626346,"Hiked the approach trail today. We began at 11:30 and were in the parking lot by 5. It was no where near as bad as I have heard. Let me back up a bit. We drove down to Neel gap and Tribute picked us up and took us to the arch where I got my tag, #297. We hiked to the parking lot at the fire service rd and he met us there and we are staying at the Amicalola lodge tonight. Fresh legs and full bellies! Shout out to Bluebird from Traverse city, MI!! I had the pleasure of meeting her on trail today, and we both reached the top of Springer mtn in good form.

Rain is in the forecast for tomorrow night. I got an email from my son today asking when I'd be back. Oh man it has been ever present in my mind and a struggle. I'll be back in July. I may cry everyday for a while, but this is worth it.  It will be difficult but it will also build character. I will also miss my brother when he leaves. So a few things have been coming to a head. I will make it through it. Friends help. I met a number of hikers today. Pacer from Indiana, Chives who is another vet, and capt planet who is working as a ridge runner.

The struggle is real. Yesterday was also cold and wet and even though I'm crossing the miles and collecting white blazed is getting old.One more day. Tomorrow will hopefully bring renewed hope. I'm heading for muskrat shelter, about 15 miles north, lots of climbing which will help keep me warm, right?? I didn't eat tonight. Between the emotions and physical stress hunger just isn't present.
