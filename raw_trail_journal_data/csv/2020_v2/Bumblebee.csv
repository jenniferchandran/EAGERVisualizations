Bumblebee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625732,"I did a 5 mile hike yesterday to try my barefoot shoes in the pitiful snow we have. They were fine. So much nicer to hike in than boots. My hips and knees don't hurt wearing them. I'm barefoot 95% of the time anyway.I met a nice couple at Trout lake yesterday. I chatted about my upcoming thru hike with the woman. She wants to do a section herself. I told her to do it! I also told her to look up some LASHer groups on Facebook. I let her know I expect to see her on the trail this summer.On my way back to the parking lot I heard a man yell and a couple dogs making distress sounds (I thought). I started down the trail again thinking it was that couple and their dogs. I about gave myself a heart attack hurrying! I went the first mile and didn't see anything, gave up and started road walking back to my car. I came upon three hunters with a pair of beagles. It was their dogs kicking up the fuss! There was a really young female who made the sound i heard. Damn dog! She was cute though. Lol I got a good cardio workout anyway!",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Mon",0
Bumblebee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625839,"i tried to go for a hike yesterday. Took everything to the trail and put my car keys in my pack. I got out of my car and, just like the compulsive door locker that I am, hit the lock button before stepping out! As soon as I closed that door I knew I'd done it. Thankfully, I had my phone in my hand. I had to call my husband to come with the spare to let me in. It was cold out there without my pack! I ran up and down the steps by the dam to get warm, so I still got a workout. I was doing so good with this car too! I've had it almost 2 years without locking myself out. That is a record for me. I have locked myself out of every car I've ever owned. I had a tight schedule yesterday so by the time he got there to let me in I had to go home. I'm glad I won't need to worry about keys on the AT...",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Sat",0
Bumblebee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625906,"I finally got a chance to hike in a decent amount of snow yesterday. It kicked my ass! Walking in snow is like walking in sand. It had been a couple days since the snow fell so i wasn't breaking trail. It felt just like walking on the beach. Serious exercise there!My barefoot shoes are still working though. I'll have to wear plastic bags inside to keep my feet dry in snow. If it's warm enough to rain wet won't matter as much. 55 days until I leave for Amicalola. I hate airports! I'll be glad when that part is over. I still have to call and confirm my reservation at the lodge. 6 months of going places I've never been and seeing things I've never seen makes me anxious and excited at the same time. Being in the woods will be comforting,trail towns will be scary. I'm used to being alone. Crowds make me anxious.I can't wait to see Harley and the kids.",,View Entry,"Jan 22, Wed",0
Bumblebee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625927,"i took the rain jacket/pack cover I made  to test today. It worked very well. Kept my core and my pack dry. I think I'll spray it with waterproofing spray though. I'm pretty sure it's nylon and apparently nylon is water absorbing. I tried small plastic garbage bags between my socks today. Didn't work. I need to figure something out soon. I'm not wearing those damn boots! They make my hip and knees hurt. No pain with the barefoot shoes. Cold isn't a problem until they get wet. Have to find a way to keep them dry.What a mess on the trail today! The first mile was ice and the rest was slush; cold, wet, slush. I had to put on my snow trax, then a mile later take them off. I was so cold when i got home. I could not get warm. I got my sleeping bag out and crawled inside to warm up. My Kelty Tuck is so comfy. It worked too.",,View Entry,"Jan 24, Fri",0
Bumblebee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626215,"I think I've finally found a way to keep my feet dry when it's cold. I bought silicone shoe covers to wear inside my shoes. I'll only need them on cold, wet days. I'll be better off with wet feet when it's warm. The closer my start date gets the less time I have to hike! Haven't been able to hike in a week. I'm going to have to get my Firm videos out just to have some conditioning. It would be good for me.We finally got some real winter weather here. Single digits yesterday. Looking at the weather on the AT right now I'm glad I chose to wait until mid March! I saw -29 in one spot yesterday! Bad enough I have to deal with that nonsense at home. No way am i doing that in a tent!",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Sat",0
Bumblebee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626714,"It's getting real! 4 days of work left, 10 days until I leave for GA. My co-workers and family are getting anxious and I'm getting more excited. I got my hair cut so i won't have to mess with it on the trail. Yesterday would have been Koda's 9th birthday. I miss my fat man so much. I finally got around to putting some of his ashes in the vial Christopher bought me. I just have to decide how I'm going to wear it.",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Sun",0
Bumblebee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627025,"one more day until I leave for Amicalola! Yes, I'm still going. The panic buying will subside when people run out of money. The virus itself isn't that big a threat. The towns along the trail count on our business to make their money. It might be harder, but then again it might not. I was looking forward to finding a tramily, and I probably still will, just smaller. If I don't go now I won't have another chance. The regret from not trying will be too much to handle. Life is a risk. Take it!",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Mon",0
