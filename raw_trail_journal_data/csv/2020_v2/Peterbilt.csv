Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625647,"Hi, my name is Peterbilt and I plan on doing a SOBO Flip Flop of the AT starting on February 29th. I'll be hiking with a friend and we plan to start in Harper's Ferry and head south, then once we have attained Springer we will head to Katahdin and head south back to Harper's Ferry. If anyone else out there is planning on this type of hike please send me a note in the comments section. I'll be retiring at the end of January 2020 and have been looking forward to a thru hike of the AT since I was in college. I've hiked probably 1,000 miles of the AT over the years in short section hikes. This will be my first attempt at a thru hike. Looking forward to meeting folks out on the trail and hiking into the Spring!",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Wed",0
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625669,"So, I thought I'd talk a little about the gear I'll be using on the trail. I've come a long way since the 80's, 90's and even 2000's when I was hiking with some serious weight. In the 80's and 90's I would usually be carrying at least 20 lbs. of camera equipment with me to catch the 'perfect picture'. SLR, various wide angle and telephoto lens, tripod - you get the picture. On this AT hike I will be using my phone to take pictures. In the 2000's I was a Scoutmaster and used to hike with everything including the kitchen sink 'just in case'! My packs would usually weigh in at 50 - 60 lbs. By the end of my Scoutmaster days I had learned to have the Scouts carry any communal equipment, and had my pack weight down to around 45 lbs. I've become an advocate of lightweight backpacking since my Scouting days and plan on having my base weight around 15 lbs. for this AT hike. I believe that the lighter your pack the better your experience will be on the trail. I'm still dialing in my gear for this hike and will post what I'm taking in the Gear section once I have everything together. I may be a few pounds heavier to start as I will hitting the trail at the end of February in West Virginia but will try and not go over 17 lbs. base weight. I love winter backpacking but sleep a little on the cold side, so I tend to bring a sleeping bag rated at 0 degrees. It will add about a pound  to my base weight but sleeping warm is worth it to me. Most of my equipment I have been using for some time but I have a couple of new items that I will be trying out. I just purchased a Zpacks Duplex tent and will try it out this weekend. I've been using a Big Agnes Copper Spur ULII and love it, but I am 6'8"" and my head and toes touch each end of the tent. The Duplex is a little longer and about 1 1/2 lbs. lighter, so we'll see how it does. After everything I've read about it, it seems to be a great tent for the AT. Most of the rest of my gear is fairly basic. I use an Osprey Exos 58 liter pack, a Sawyer squeeze water filter, a MSR Pocket Rocket stove, A Western Mountaineering 0 degree down bag, a Neoair XTherm pad. Again as I get all my gear together I'll post it in the Gear section with my final base weight.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Thu",0
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625682,"My wife and I live in Fauquier County, Virginia which is about 25 miles east of Shenandoah National Park. I've spent the last 40 years hiking in Shenandoah and consider it my backyard. I hike with a group of friends and family and we try and get out as much as possible on the weekends for day hikes or overnighters somewhere in the Park. We spend a bit of time hiking in many other areas of Virginia and West Virginia, but I consider Shenandoah my home base. Although the AT through Shenandoah is somewhat gentle there are many hikes that we do where you can do anywhere from 1000 feet to 2500 feet in elevation gain in a couple of miles, which really helps with the training routine. Probably our favorite quick hike is Little Devil Falls Trail in the Northern section of the Park. You can start at the base and do 1500 feet of elevation gain in 2 1/2 miles and then an easy 3 mile trip back down on the fire road back to your car. It's a great training hike and I highly recommend it. Today's picture is from the Hazel Mountain backcountry which is in the central section of the Park. We did this hike just after a serious snow and wind storm had swept through the area. Most of the trail for miles was covered in downed trees and we spent more time bushwhacking than we did on the trail. Within a month or three the trail was cleared and back to normal thanks to the great work of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC) which maintains the trail in this part of Virginia. Without their volunteers and trail crews the AT experience would be quite different.",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Fri",0
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625945,"I visited the ATC office in Harpers Ferry on Saturday with my son. We spent some time talking with Highlander, a 2019 thru hiker, who was manning the office. It was nice to be able to speak with him about his experiences on the trail last year. He did a NOBO thru hike. Not too many people starting flip flops from Harpers Ferry yet, but I’m sure that will change in a month or two. 
The reason I chose to do a flip flop was because of the congestion on the trail at Springer in March and April. Sine I’m hiking SOBO I’ll still land up going through the NOBO bubble, but probably not until southern Virginia. I was looking for a little bit more solitude on the trail, at least to start out with. We’ll see how it turns out!
One issue in Harpers Ferry is that the walkway across the river is still out. A train derailed last summer on the bridge and took down the train bridge and associated walkway for the AT. Not sure when it will be repaired. Right now you have to get a shuttle to get across the River, or hike across the 340 bridge, which is not recommended because of the narrow shoulders. I was thinking that I could bring my canoe and just ferry across the Shenandoah to get to the other side, but maybe I’ll save that for when I finish (the water will be warmer later in the year!).
Harpers Ferry is a great little town with such historic significance. We went to the Flip Flop Festival last year and it was a blast. I’ll have to miss it this year as it’s not until the end of April, and hopefully we’ll be in NC by then.",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Sun",0
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626061,"Friday, January 31st was technically my last day at work. It was a strange feeling, walking out on a career that spanned over 40 years. I will still be helping out and mentoring folks in the company, but I’ve given up the day to day schedule that’s been part of me for my entire adult life. And I am definitely ready for the next chapter!Right now my oldest son and I are getting ready to hit the slopes in Big Sky, Montana. We skied out here 12 years ago and it was my son’s first ski trip out west. We like to take a week and ski out west every couple of years. My son wanted to go back to Big Sky and see the mountain again and to see how much his skills have increased. For me, I will be content cruising the groomers and enjoying being in the western mountains again. I’ll have three weeks when we get back to finalize everything for the hike. I’ve got a few things left to purchase and I need to tweak the equipment one last time. Since I’ll be hiking SOBO from Harpers Ferry I’ll be in my home territory for a while. My younger son will be hiking with us for the first couple of days to see us off. He’s a NOLS graduate and an avid outdoorsman and I know he would love to do the entire hike with us. We’ve got a couple friends that will probably do some short sections with us which I will look forward to immensely.So, the next chapter is here and it’s off to a great start! Best wishes to everyone who has already started and for those gearing up. The trail is calling.",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Mon",0
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626380,"Got back from Montana on Feb. 8th. What a great week skiing. We got over three feet of snow in six days. Great exercise for the leg muscles and lungs especially at altitude. And it was fantastic to spend a week with my older son. His skills on the slopes have gotten much better than mine!Since I’ve been back I’ve been trying to finalize my gear and finish up everything I need to do before we hit the trail. Tried out the Zpacks Duplex - it worked great. It’s actually long enough for me. The Alpenlite bag worked well with a silk liner at 19 degrees. Still have one or two final things to get - will make a run to REI on Monday or Tuesday. Seems like there is just not enough time to get everything done before we start. I got a call from the son of a friend from church this week. He started thru hiking the AT in 2017 and put in about 320 miles before pulling off for a medical issue. His trail name is Slacker Rojo and he is ready to try again and will start with us on Saturday. It’s great to have someone with thru hiking experience hiking with us. The tramily is starting to form!We got out on the AT yesterday and and did about seven miles in the central section of Shenandoah. What a beautiful day. Started out around 20 degrees and warmed up to about 45 degrees. Outstanding views along the ridge line. If the weather could just stay like this...but, as the saying goes, no rain, no pain, no Maine!My younger son will start with us and hike for about three days. Unfortunately he will have to head back to work after that. It will be great to start with him though. Looking forward to getting this adventure started and putting in some miles. I hope everyone that has started already is doing well and enjoying themselves. Keep on truckin’!",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Sun",0
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626493,"Well tomorrow’s the day. We will be heading up to Harper’s Ferry in the morning and do the registration thing at the ATC headquarters there. Three of us will be signing in as thru hikers - myself, my friend Ed (trail name TBD) and Slacker Rojo. My younger son will join us for three days and pull out on Monday. His wife, my older son and his girlfriend will join us for the first two miles up to Loudoun Heights. They will head back to HP after that and we will move on. Should be quite a crew for the first couple of miles!It’s hard to believe that the day is here. I’m still repacking my pack and trying to figure out what I’ve missed. All that will fade away tomorrow with the first steps on the trail. Can’t wait to get started. I would certainly be lying if I said that I didn’t have some apprehension about this trip. Mostly related to how this old body will stand up to the rigors of the trail. We’ll take it day by day and see how it goes. We’re in no hurry and plan on doing 6-7 mile days for the first three days. That should put us down at Bears Den Hostel off of Rt. 7 by Monday.Weather looks good for the next three days, then three days of off and on rain. It’s definitely warmer here in Northern Virginia than normal. Let’s see if the trend continues throughout March. We usually get at least one snowstorm in early to mid March but this year I’m not sure we will. I hope everyone that has started is enjoying themselves and making some miles. See you on the trail...",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Fri",0
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626512,"Well, today was quite a day. Woke up at 5:30 to feed the dogs and finish packing my pack. Finally got everything done and then the crew arrived. We drove up to Harpers Ferry and signed in at the ATC HQ. Took the requisite photo and loaded up. Hiked out of Harper’s Ferry and across the 340 bridge. The Shenandoah was running well, almost wanted to get my canoe, but it was a little chilly!All seven of us and two dogs hiked up to Loudoun Heights. At that point my older son, his girlfriend and my younger son’s wife headed back to Harper’s Ferry with the dogs.It’s about a seven hundred foot climb out of Harper’s Ferry- not bad at all. Proceeded to hike down past Keys Gap and to our destination for the evening. Great hostel with a wonderful owner. I know we will sleep well tonight!","Harper’s Ferry
",Bears Feet Hostel,"Feb 29, Sat",6.80
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626532,"Well you couldn’t ask for a better day. Temps started out around freezing this morning and warmed up to around 45. Wind was less of an issue today as well. Walking the ridge line above Loudoun County on one side and the Shenandoah Valley on the other. Nice rock outcropping with some great views.It was hard to leave Bears Feet Hostel this morning. Patsy is a great host and she two wonderful dogs - Hot Lips Houlihan and Trapper John. They kept us company last night. Patsy has a beautiful house and the downstairs is set up as a hostel, but you feel like your at home. I would highly recommend Bears Feet Hostel to anyone on the trail.Right now we are camped on a ridge looking East, so we should get a nice sunrise in the morning. We making for Bears Den Hostel tomorrow where my wife will pick up my son and Ed. Ed’s getting off the trail for a few days and hopes to hook back up with us on Thursday. I’ be sorry to see them go.I hope everyone is doing well and staying safe out there.","Bears Feet Hostel
",Stealth Camp,"Mar 01, Sun",6.90
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626552,"We had a nice night up on the ridge. Very pretty sunrise this morning. A little slow out of camp but not bad for the first day tent camping. It was a pleasant walk along the ridge and then, The Roller Coaster started. Lots of 400 - 500 foot ups and downs. I remember hiking this section for an adult shakedown for Philmont when I was doing Scouts. At the time they had had snow, which melted and had refrozen so we landed up ice skating for 8 miles. Much better today!We arrived at Bears Den this afternoon, dropped our packs and headed over to Bears Chase Brewery for a couple of cold ones and some food. My wife came and picked us up and took us back to Bears Den. She brought me a small resupply. Then Ed, whose new trail name is Sea Anchor, and my son headed back home with my wife. I doubt Sea Anchor will be back, it’s been a struggle for him the last three days. But it was great hiking with both of them while they were here.We’ve got the rest of the Roller Coaster tomorrow, probably in the rain. Trying to make Rod Hollow Shelter for tomorrow night. I know I will sleep well tonight. Maybe not so much tomorrow night!","Stealth Camp
",Bears Den Hostel,"Mar 02, Mon",6.20
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626760,"Well today was tough. We started out from Bears Den Hostel making for Rod Hollow Shelter. It was overcast and very windy but no rain yet. So we both started out in tee shirts because we still had the rest of the Roller Coaster to finish. About a mile in it started raining, but it would stop and start, so I didn’t want to put on my rain shell. Well, three quarters up a good incline it started to come down pretty good. So I stopped to put on my shell but I was already drenched in sweat. Hiked a couple more miles to Sam Moore shelter where Slacker Rojo was hanging out. I was very cold and after about 5 minutes started shivering uncontrollably. We debated what to do because we still had seven miles to the next shelter and there was a major thunder storm moving in that would hit well before we got to our destination. We made the decision to walk back to Bears Den and take a zero the next day so I could recover. Best decision I ever made. If I had continued on I probably would have gone in to full blown hypothermia.","Bears Den Hostel

Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626761,Finally made it back to the trail after several days. Decided to slack pack the next couple of sections. I finally got to count the mileage from Bears Den to Sam Moore as This was the third time we hiked this section in a couple of days. Out and back on Tuesday and again today to complete the section. It’s a shame I can only count it once for AT mileage! Beautiful day. I felt much better and we made fairly good time.,"Bears Den

Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626763,"My friend Rob joined us today to hike this section. He and I have been hiking together for over 40 years. I thoroughly enjoyed his company on the trail and got to hear about his latest adventuring paddling 85 miles of the Lower Canyons of the Rio Grande.It was a delightful day, starting out in the high thirties and moving into the fifties with sunshine. We got to a Rod Hollow shelter (our original destination last Tuesday!) which is the end of the Roller Coaster section. The miles slipped away pretty quickly from there and we were soon at Ashby Gap. Rob and I drove back to Bears Chase Brewery (across the road from Bears Den) and had a great lunch looking out over Loudoun County. All in all a great day.","Route 605
",Ashby Gap,"Mar 08, Sun",7.40
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626764,"It was just Slacker a Rojo and myself today. Being a Monday there were not many people on the trail today. Started with a thousand foot climb out of Ashby Gap to get to elevation, then miles of winding trail on the ridge line. Sunny day with temps in the upper 70’s! Definitely a tee shirt day.We hiked above Sky Meadows State Park, which is a wonderful place. I’ve spent a lot of time there over the years as it is fairly close to my house. Open meadows, forested hills and great views. All in all a great state park.Had  some lunch on the trail then pushed on to Manassas Gap shelter. The spring was running so we filtered some water for the last few miles. With the temperatures being this high I was definitely drinking more water. Cranked out the last three miles down to Route 55 and called it a day.Have to take another zero tomorrow. Unfortunately I have to attend the funeral of one of my Eagle Scouts. He’s battled Crohn’s all his life and it progressed into cancer and took him down. Absolutely tragic. He leaves behind a wife, three year old daughter and a six month old son. They have a very strong family though, and I know with everyone’s help they will get through this.","Ashby Gap

Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628245,"Well, we got back on the trail today after almost two months off. The Park Service reopened SNP on Saturday to day hiking. We decided that we would try and slack pack thru the Park over the next week or two. Started out at Jenkins Gap just inside the Park and hiked back out to Route 522. A beautiful day that was warm, not not hot. Great views to the west into the Shenandoah Valley, Massanutten Mountain and on into West Virginia. The air was definitely clearer than normal, maybe due to the recents rains. Usually by this time of year it starts to get fairly hazy in the Shennies. There were many wildflowers blooming and the Mountain Laurel was just breaking out. A great day to start back out.","Route 522

A fairly easy climb up and over Mt. Marshall. Gotta love the grades on the trails in this park. A fair number of people on the trail today as it’s Sunday. Good views both east and west, with the best being a rock outcrop on South Mt. Marshall.","Jenkins Gap

Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628350,"Started out today under overcast skies, temps around 57 degrees and a slight rain falling. The rain stopped fairly quickly and we hiked up and over Little Hogback. The Park Service built large bird houses on top of Hogback to try and reintroduce Peregrine Falcons into the Park. I’m not sure if it has been successful or not.After hiking down the other side of Hogback we crossed Skyline Drive. We passed Sugerloaf Trail, which is a great blue blazed trail which connects to several other trails which can be used for some great circuit hiking in this area. We continued on the trail which was pretty mellow in this section. Lots of wildflowers and shrubs in bloom. The air was pungent with the smell of the flowering blooms. Passed some Mt. Laurel in bloom, the first I’ve seen this year. Looks like they will be flowering over the next week or so. Should be quite a show!We continued on past Elkwallow Wayside which has killer blackberry ice cream in season when it’s open. A few people were picnicking there. We didn’t see anyone on the trail today.Hiked another couple of miles to Neighbor Mtn. trailhead and called it a day.Another great day on the trail!","Little Hogback

Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628425,"Another beautiful day for hiking. Started out in the mid 60’s and when we finished it was 76 degrees. A bright blue sky for most of the day.Since we are slack packing we decided to go south to north today. Started out at Jewell Hollow and proceeded along the cliff line with views looking west. Then back up to the ridge line with lots of rock outcrops along the way. We continued on to Mary’s Rock, which is one of the better views in the Park. It’s also a very popular destination as it’s a four mile round trip hike up from the parking lot at Rt. 211. Today did not disappoint as there were probably 40-50 people up on the rocks when we got there. We probably passed a couple hundred people by the time we reached Rt. 211. For the remaining five miles north of 211 we passed 6 people!The long downhills today took their toll on my left knee. I’ve got a torn meniscus but I have not needed surgery on it yet. I just have to be careful on the downhills. The last uphill, while only about a five hundred foot climb, kicked my butt. Not sure why but I lost steam about halfway up and struggled the rest of the way. All in all though it was a nice day to be out.","Neighbor Mtn. Trail
",Jewell Hollow,"Jun 07, Sun",9.60
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628559,"We started out at Jewell Hollow this morning heading south. A cool start to the day with a light breeze. Overcast skies all day. Great hiking weather. 
There were goods views to the west as we started up Stonyman Mtn. Stonyman is a ‘destination’ in the Park, as it has nice rock outcrops and lots of rock. My son likes to climb up here occasionally. He’s into technical rock climbing and this is one of the closer spots to where we live. Once you crest Stonyman you come down the other side into Skyland, which is a mountain resort that was built in the late 1800’s by George Pollock. He built it as a resort for those who needed to get out of Washington. He developed a lot of the trails that are still there today. He also employed a lot of the mountain people who lived in the nearby hills and hollows. It’s good to see that it is still operating today.
We stopped at Skyland and had a little lunch sitting outside. Headed back on the trail and went up and over Hawksbill. Made it to Rock Spring Hut early. We’re the only ones here so far. There’s a cabin just below the hut that you can rent from the PATC. The cabin overseer is there today trying to clean it out, since it hasn’t been used for the past two months due to the COVID pandemic. 
Looks like we’ll get an early dinner and early to bed.","Jewell Hollow
",Rock Spring Hut,"Jun 14, Sun",9.20
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628591,"Well there were several more people that showed up at the shelter last night. Two NOBO’s that had started at Springer, a father with three boys section hiking the SNP, and two folks who came in late and were still asleep when we left. 
Got on the trail around 7:00 am and headed for Big Meadows. Big Meadows is a lodge and a campground with a ‘wayside’, which is a store that sells food to go. The campground had quite a few folks in it either car camping or in RV’s. We resisted the temptation to hit the wayside, as it’s a considerable distance from the trail.We came down the south side of Big Meadows to Milam Gap. Skyline Drive crosses here and there is a small parking lot. It’s a popular spot to start a circuit hike in the area. We passed several people heading down Mill Prong Trail which goes to Camp Hoover. Camp Hoover was built in 1929 by President Hoover and his wife as a Presidential retreat. The requirements for the camp were that it was above 2,500 feet to avoid most mosquitoes and that it be near an excellent trout stream. It has been restored by the Park Service to it’s original 1929 condition. It’s an interesting day hike.
We kept moving down the AT which in this section is fairly flat for quite a ways. Then it was up and over Hazeltop. A couple of rock outcrops at the top had some nice views looking west.
Then it was down the other side and up Bearfence Mountain which has an excellent rock scramble at the top with great views. We proceeded to Bearfence Hut, which is where we were going to spend the night, but it was only 1:30. So we decided to do another six miles to South River. 
This section goes past Lewis Mountain Campground, where we stopped for a little lunch and got water. Then on for the last five miles to South River. All in all a great day.","Rock Spring Hut

Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630667,"It’s been three months to the day since Slacker Rojo and I stopped our hike. I had gotten a nasty pulled muscle behind my knee into my calf and walking was problematic for a while. SR had gotten some blisters and wanted some time to recoup. I rested my leg for about two weeks and tried a local trail, but ended up limping the last three miles back to my car. After two more months and a bit of PT I think we are ready to get back on the trail. Since we will never make Katahdin before it closes for the season this has really become a section hike. We figured we would slack pack the first day and what a day it was. Started out at South River Picnic area. Temp was 50 degrees. When we finished it was 59 degrees. Perfect hiking weather!We did an easy three miles to get to Swift Run Gap where Rt. 33 crossed Skyline Drive. Then a 2 1/2 mile climb up Hightop Mtn. with a 1200 foot elevation gain. The trail up the mountain is wonderful - lots of switchbacks and mostly dirt. Before long we were at the top. There are a couple of good views on top. Today’s picture is one of them. Then down the other side passing Hightop Hut and spring and quickly coming to Smith Roach Gap. All in all a great day to be out. We passed a few day hikers and two SOBO’s on top of Hightop. They were taking a break at one of the viewpoints. We hope to get back on the trail on Sunday and finish up the last 40 miles of Shenandoah National Park next week.","South River
",Smith Roach Gap,"Sep 15, Tue",7.50
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630849,"My friend Rob decided to join us for a couple of days to continue on in the southern section of SNP. It was absolutely gorgeous today as the temps were in the 50’s with bright sunshine and a forecast of 39 degrees that evening. We started out at Smith Roach Gap and did a couple of hills before coming down to Simmons Gap. At Simmons Gap we crossed Skyline Drive and were about to renter the woods, except there was a young button buck that was guarding the entrance to the trail. Slacker Rojo and the deer seemed to be making friends, as today’s picture attests to. He was very curious about us and did not want to give up his ground. We stayed there for about 10 minutes and he finally moved off into the brush. 
From there we ascended Weaver Mountain which has a nice view from the summit. Then down the other side and eventually to our destination for the evening, Pinefield Hut. We got there about 3:00 pm and were the only ones there for a while. 
We pitched our tents and were just hanging out when a few others started to come in. First a couple probably in their mid fifties who were hiking the Park from Rockfish Gap to Front Royal. Then three guys who looked like an older father and two sons in their thirties. Another couple with a cute Jack Russell terrier came in after dinner. They set up behind the shelter since all the tent sites were already taken. They were also hiking the Park NOBO. Finally another couple came in late and decided to stay in the shelter because there wasn’t anyone else in there. It turned into quite a crew for the evening.
We ate early and were in bed by 7:30. All in all a great day.","Smith Roach Gap
",Pinefield Hut,"Sep 20, Sun",7
Peterbilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630850,"It was a nice night at Pinefield Hut. Temps were in the high 30’s or low 40’s. Great sleeping weather. I used my 20 degree bag as a quilt most of the night, zipping it up slightly around 4:00 am. It’s a Western Mountaineering down bag and you can get overheated in it at temps above freezing if it’s fully zipped. I love Western Mountaineering bags because of the quality of the bag, but most of all because they make several of their bags in a 7 foot variety. Since I’m over 6’8” I have trouble finding things that fit.
I was up at first light but took my time packing up because nobody else was up. Went down and filtered some water for the day. Spent a bit of time talking with the couple with the dog. They were the first ones out of camp around 7:15. We finally got everything together and headed out around 8:00. 
A bit of history. When SR and I got off the trail in June I had pulled a tendon behind my knee. It took some time to heal and I was back hiking  in August without incident. SR and I slack packed the first part of the southern section of SNP last weekend. My leg did alright but started hurting slightly later in the week. Since  there was only some minor pain I figured I could make it this trip and see how it went. 
The morning’s hike started out OK but the leg was still bothering me a bit. We had hiked about 3 miles and had just started up Loft Mountain when my knee and calf seized up big time. I couldn’t walk at all for about 10 minutes, then slowly was able to hobble on it. Thank God for trekking poles. The pain was intense with each step, like someone stabbing you behind the knee with every step. We took a look at where we were and the quickest exit was at Loft Mountain Campground, about 1 1/2 miles ahead. Somehow I was able to make it to the campground. Rob and SR caught a ride with a shuttle driver from Stanimals in Waynesboro back to our car in Rockfish Gap. I’m now at home and have an appointment with my orthopedic doctor Thursday morning. We’ll see what he says and what the prognosis is for getting back on the trail. Between COVID and my body it doesn’t seem that this is my year for hiking. But I’m not going to let it deter me. I will be back on the trail as soon as I am able. Good luck and best wishes for everyone still out on the trail. Keep on truckin’!","Pinefield Hut
