Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608263,"After working in corporate America (and Europe) since college, I am about ready to start something I have been waiting to do for 25 years--hike the AT. Events of the past year are a reminder that you have to take advantage of an opportunity to do what you really want to do. It is exciting and very strange after a conventional set of choices over the years, to suddenly do something so completely opposite. 
The next 6 weeks will be spent working on logistics, final preparations, and conditioning myself mentally and physically for the grind. I will do what I can to put in miles in the New England early mud season and take a couple of overnights to test out new equipment.
Since I can't start until early May, the plan is to begin in the middle of Virginia, ahead of most of the NOBO's, get to Katahdin, and then return to the starting point in VA and head south.

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608717,"It is still winter in New England with snow, ice, and variable conditions which makes hiking challenging but there is no better way to get into the right trail shape. Otherwise preparation will continue over the next month plus with physical conditioning, logistics planning, gear testing, trial run overnights, and taking care of personal business.

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609224,"I had every intention of going to Pisgah State Park yesterday but ended up at Monadnock instead. I connected White Dot, Cascade Link, Birchtoft, Harling, and an unnamed xcountry ski trail back to the campground. Conditions were slick ice, slush, mud, standing/running water, snow, and my favorite--what looks like snow but you fall through into the standing water below. Slow going and tweaked my left leg a little along with my back from slipping and catching myself a few times but overall a pretty reasonable conditioning hike.
One more week at my job, more conditioning hikes over next weekend, and will then drive to TN to see my folks. On the way back to NH I will head over to the AT in NC or TN to test some new equipment such as a sleeping quilt which I hope will work for me because it weighs a little over a pound. My longtime hiking buddy, Lowbag, will accompany me. 
This week I visited my Columbia, SC office to say goodbye to my friends and coworkers there and they surprised me by taking up a collection and getting me an REI gift certificate which will help me with resupply and gear replacement during my hike. Thanks, guys. Very much appreciated.","Park Headquarters

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609805,"It was a big transition week for me as it was my last week on my job. I spent the week trying to finish up some things and people were kind enough to throw me a party in Jersey City, another in the Boston office, and another in the neighborhood. It will be hard to leave some of those great relationships behind.
My wife (Mama Bear) smoked pull pork for my party for over 12 hours and it must have smelled as good to the bears as it did to me because there was one seen next door. Luckily he didn't come onto our deck.
On Saturday I was pretty tired from the long week and got a slow start at Horatio Colony. The new snow overnight managed to hide the lingering ice and made walking interesting. And slow.
On Sunday I was on the trail at 7:00 and got at least 3 hours in trying to find an ice free way up to the higher parts of Monadnock. As I stubbornly refused to put on micro spikes again this season, it didn't work, but I was outside hiking so it's ok. 
Tomorrow I will take the long drive to TN to see my family and next weekend I will get a night out on the NC/TN border to test out some new equipment and leave some trail magic for the thru hikers.","Hwy 124

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610584,"In my first week after leaving my job, I drove 2 days to West TN to visit my family before I take off, then drove to a friend's (Lowbag) house in Maryville on Friday. The plan was to plan a car shuttle for Sat-Sun and stay near the Spring Mtn Shelter Saturday night. Rain was torrential on the way to the trailhead. We parked our trucks and started late morning. We stayed mostly dry in cloudy weather. It was good to be in the Southern Appalachians again where I learned to backpack in the 80's. During the day we heard owls and a raven which I have only heard at the highest elevations in the South. The trail was well graded and a nice change to the mud, ice, and rocks of New England so walking was easy except for the fact that I couldn't get my Mammut pack adjusted exactly right. At the Rich Mtn firetower Lowbag had some issues with dizziness so after I climbed the tower to look at the endless blue folds of Western NC and East TN mountains, we headed back down to a pleasant site on a ridge with a nice pipe spring nearby. We were joined later by Try Try, a delightful lady who tried to hike the AT last year but some broken bones had other ideas. So she was back to give it another shot this year. Several NOBO's passed us including Two Blade and Miss Piggy who stopped to chat awhile. We had a great evening and shared some Spamherd's pie for dinner. I tested out my new sleeping quilt overnight and while I didn't sleep well at all, I don't think the quilt was to blame. In the late evening it started to rain and we woke to dark mist and clouds and while our gear got soaked it wasn't too bad. We had a hot cup of Oregon Chai Latte and a fig bar and took the short walk (just a few clicks) out back to Tanyard Gap. Get better Lowbag. I hope I see you somewhere up the trail.I will go out again on the Wapack Trail in NH on Friday and stay in a shelter on the top of Barrett Mtn to celebrate Good Friday.""Crystal fountain springing from the hill, you irrigate my soul.

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610734,"Today I stopped by EMS in Peterborough because they have some thru hikers on staff and had offered to help me lighten and refine my load. I wasn't sure if they could help much initially but was pleasantly surprised. Charlotte (Bearclaw) of PCT and AT fame was there today and we spread everything on the floor of the store and she went through my pack item by item challenging me on a number of items. She helped me with dropping some unnecessary packaging, duplicate items, water filtration items, rain pants, bowl, and excessive stove fuel. She also helped a lot with adjusting my still unfamiliar Mammut Heron Light pack and getting it to ride better. All in all, I feel much better than I did a couple of days ago about the pack that I took a chance on and bought at a bargain price last fall. I will try out the new system this Friday and Saturday. She also inspected my 10 year old Osprey and feels it is good to go as well. I actually might start out with that one for the warmer months (TBD).

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611055,"Spring is trying to arrive in NE which means somewhat better temps, overcast and some rain, and yes, mud. I had plans on Friday to get a good overnight on the Wapack Trail so I took my (overloaded) pack to the trailhead and it seems I need to replace my Platypus. Since I didn't want to sleep in a wet quilt, I aborted and hiked for the afternoon instead.
This morning I headed for Monadnock in cool, typically overcast, and intermittently raining conditions. The rocks were epically slippery so it was slow going with a high degree of difficulty. I walked for about 3 hours mostly in a cloud at the higher elevations and found a rock overhang to eat my breakfast (Trader Joe's blueberry bran muffin, almond butter, and cheese) in somewhat dry conditions. This week I will continue the routine of conditioning, prepping for the hike in numerous ways, and taking care of things around the house before I take off. Next weekend I will amp up the hiking distance to keep toughening up the feet.",,Wapack Trail and Mt Monadnock,"Apr 21, Sun",0
Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611742,"This weekend I did 3 prep hikes--one near my house in the cold rain, one at Mt Monadnock, and today across 2 peaks with J Tree near the north terminus of the Wapack Trail. It was nice having set up a shuttle to go end to end. Walking was variable as usual in New England in April with more water on the rocks, mud, and sneaky lingering ice. However it was a great hike and exactly what I needed today. The elk jerky was good, too. J Tree, hope you can join me for a week in July if it works out.
Otherwise prep is going great. I spent some time sorting my drop boxes, test loading my pack for the start, grabbing some last minute equipment, and giving Kate (Mama Bear) her trail boss training. Just a few final details this week and I will be Day 2 on the trail a week from today though that doesn't really even seem possible after all this time.
The last big item to check off before I venture out is my one year post surgery check up at Dana Farber on Wednesday, then final prep, and on my way to VA late week. Thunder",,Wapack Trail,"Apr 28, Sun",6
Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612159,"I passed a major milestone today that was potentially standing between me and my plans. I had a one year follow up visit at Dana Farber after my very nasty surgery a year ago. I was given a clean bill of health. Thanks to Dr. Choudhury, Dr. Trinh, their awesome staffs, and my wife Kate (Mama Bear) for all the support. It is unbelievable when I think about how far I have come since one year ago. 
So I will take Thursday and Friday for last minute preparations, drive to Northern Virginia on Saturday, then be kicked out of the car in the Troutville area on Sunday when I start heading back north. The extra day will help us get everything done and also ensure I don't start walking in a thunderstorm. I know I will be doing that (a lot) but I'm not too keen on starting out that way.

At least the springs will be flowing.Not sure how far I will go today so I will play that by ear depending on weather.We headed for the Cracker Barrel in Troutville. Lowbag and Rat, our longtime friends from TN met us there to see me off. We waited out the rain so I got started later than intended to a tearful goodbye. Lowbag came in with me for 1/2 mile or so. After crossing a field, winding between some personal properties, I started around the mountains on gentle switchbacks until I got to Fullardt Knob. I was pleasantly surprised at the location. Spring in the South was popping with rhodies blooming and birds singing. Blue butterflies flew around the shelter. One tent was set up a bit behind the shelter with a couple of young guys, one who was feeling ill so was sleeping it off. I set up my tent near the shelter and had a great night overlooking the lights of Daleville and Troutville.","Troutville

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613044,"After my required Starbuck's Via I started walking at 7:00 to a bright and cool spring morning, winding down the north and east side of the knob. Soon I ran into Cherokee Rose, a really nice trail angel who was walking the trails with the purpose of helping hikers in need. I then started a series of drops into and out of deep creek ravines. I stopped for water at Curry Creek (funny, it didn't taste like curry...), then reached the crossing of Wilson Creek. After all the rain, Wilson looked like a problem. There were two boulders to step across with rushing water in between. The problem was that the water was running over them so there was no walking to be done and there was no bridge, only a couple of unstable logs, one of which didn't go across the creek completely. I ended up with a clumsy acrobatic crossing using the logs and relying mostly on my upper body. I managed to get across mostly dry so it was a win.
I got to Wilson Shelter and took a long break after 6 miles. Since I stopped too early the prior day, I was looking at needing to get 7.5 miles now to get to the next water so I started the slow afternoon grind to Bobbet's. Soon I reached the Blue Ridge Parkway at Blackhorse Gap and started crossing and paralleling the road on a narrow ridge. Views were spectacular. I got down to Bobbet's on a long sidehill after 4:00 and set up in the shelter as tent spaces were few and unappealing. I was later joined by Cushy, Mighty Blue, FEMAdog, Trigger, and Free. A few others thru-hikers passed through.
As a side note, most of the day I was really uneasy about something and it just wouldn't go away. Not about what I was doing given my experience and comfort as a backpacker, but something else. This would later have a temporary impact on my AT attempt.","Fullardt

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613045,"Most of the others in the shelter left about 6:30 to get to a shuttle for a slackpack. I was next to last out, leaving at 7:05. I simply wasn't into it for some reason and still feeling uneasy. Soon after I stopped for water at Bearwallow Gap, I started climbing Cove Mtn, sat down for a snack on a convenient boulder and started trying to work through it. I came to the conclusion that if I was this uneasy, I needed to get off and figure it out, before Mama Bear left Virginia (she had been exploring VA for a few days). I called Stanimal's in Glasgow and a shuttle met me back down at Bearwallow Gap and took me to the hostel. I walked down to Scotto's for an amazing cheesesteak sandwich and ate with Cushy and some other thru hikers. Cushy lives about an hour from me in NH and was unfortunately having to get off the trail for a few days with an injury (hope she's ok).
Mama Bear picked me up and we started back north. 
The abridged version is that after running at the velocity I had been running at for so long, the intense preparation, and the emotional surge from the good medical news at Dana Farber just a few days earlier, it was simply too soon for me to go from that to just flipping a switch to the polar opposite reality. I needed a period of semi-decompression first to get in the right head space. Also Mama Bear had developed a potential medical concern the day before which needed to be checked out. It turns out she is ok but I am glad I was around when she had that concern.
The bottom line is that I plan to take a few weeks, formulate some new plans and get right back on the trail somewhere. More to come.","Bobbet's

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613903,"Great conditioning hike today starting with the Summit Trail (at Mt Sunapee, NH) to Lake Solitude on the Monadnock Sunapee Greenway. I had planned to stay out overnight on the 'MSG' but as I had a couple of bumps and bruises from landscaping and a misstep last weekend, I decided a day pack would be smarter. There was a little bit of everything with blue skies, a cool breeze, mud, lingering snow as I passed over and around the ski area, views, and the bonus of no black flies until I was almost back to the car. It turned out to be a great plan as I felt more like 100% after about 8 miles. Views from the top of the mountain and the ledges over Lake Solitude were spectacular.
Plans are coming together for re-entry on the AT. I am hopefully looking at somewhere early-mid June and depending on timing will put in at Harper's Ferry or Delaware Water Gap and head north from there. I will backpack in Vermont over the long holiday weekend next week and try to figure it out.

It was cool and clear with near gale force winds at the top (not sure how fast that is but I like the sound of it). Some people out but not nearly as many as a weekend. The continuous rock scrambling, almost vertical in places, gives as much preparation as possible for the Whites and Presidentials. It really beats up your knees and feet.

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615565,"So my trail re-entry plan has been hatched. I have to plan to be off trail for a few days in late July so I need to be in striking distance of home by then. At the moment it looks like I will be starting out at Delaware Water Gap June 17, get to within an hour or two of home by then, and get back on the trail at that point to focus on NH and Maine. After then I will hopefully be able to flip flop back down and get as far south as I can this year.
In the meantime I am spending as much time out as possible. Today I started at Kelly Stand Road in VT and walked the almost 7 miles up and over Stratton to Stratton Pond to spend the night. With cooler temps and a lot of wind I was actually cold starting out (in June???) and up top when I took a lunch break. Some hikers I would see later told me it was snowing up top a few minutes after I started to the pond. The wind made the pond look suitable for surfing so I stayed in the shelter to avoid the comedy of setting up my tent in the wind. Soon I was in my long johns due to the cold and windy conditions. I was the first there and was soon followed by the usual motley crew of hiker types (I am including myself) including Ramblin' Ray, Mountain Laurel, Stripes, Landfill, Snow Cat, and a mother and daughter who had never backpacked before but were doing the entire Long Trail.

I decided to go back over the mountain the way I had come just for the workout. There is another shorter and flatter way out (Stratton Pond Trail) but I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to work on my preparation. 
It was cool but the wind died down and I had a pleasantly manageable hike out and made better time than the day before. I saw no hikers until I passed 2 couples within a mile or two from the road. When I got back to the forest road, Fresh Ground (a former thru hiker from NC) was there with his truck and loads of food and his grill. He seems to make it his mission to help thru hikers, focusing on following early NOBO's on their trek north. He will continue to bounce north to Maine from trailhead to trailhead. After much arm twisting I joined a couple of LT thru hikers and feasted on hot dogs and 3 plate sized banana pancakes (the best pancakes I have ever had).

I had a nice breakfast break on the rocks near the cairn on top with views east and south. Though the snow is melting a bit near my house, only 30 miles away I had nothing but icy, snowy trails. The trails in places (usually the steep places) were a hard glaze ice and the wind was challenging. I discovered also that my Kahtoola microspikes have finally gotten dull. I almost figured that out the hard way. Slow going but the more I walked the more I enjoyed it. I had the trail all to myself until I passed two women about 100 yards before I got back to my truck.I picked up a few things this week for my LASH to replace damaged or lost items--a new trowel, new puffy, etc. I usually don't worry about a trowel but I started thinking about the crowds in the Smokies and the puzzling lack of privies to lessen impact.I will be driving to TN early this week to visit my parents and will hopefully get a taste of the AT next weekend somewhere between Hot Springs and Waynesboro, VA.

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627016,"I drove from NH to West TN last week to spend some time with my parents before I get on trail for a while. My plan was to pull over on the return drive and go in for a night out on the AT before returning. I decided to use the Daleville Super 8 (mere feet from the AT) as my destination for the first day's drive back to NH with the idea of hiking in a 7-8 mile route off the Blue Ridge Parkway, stay the night, and return the next day before resuming my drive north. I saw a young lady at the Super 8 that I think was a thru hiker. If so, she must have started really early and hike very fast. I awoke yesterday to a continuous cold 30 something degree rain. It's one thing to be out for a while and just keep going in the rain but getting out of a warm bed and walking into it is a little different to me. So given that and what is going on right now with the coronavirus disruption and angst, it seemed a better idea to get on back home which I did last night. I did manage to get out and stretch my legs on the trail near Bennington, VT yesterday, one hour from home. Still a lot of ice and packed snow especially on the northern facing slopes. So as it stands, unless the pandemic situation disrupts travel, supply chains, or potentially causes a hardship at home for Mama Bear, I am today 3 weeks from Georgia!

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627117,"I have decided that due to the COVID-19 disruption to travel and services and the need to be here with Mama Bear till this thing settles down, my plans for GA on 4-7 must be delayed indefinitely.

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627406,"Like everyone else, I am just trying to wait for things to get back to whatever normal is so I (we) can get on the trail. I have updated my starting date to the most optimistic scenario of May 1. I will also move my range further north to either the southern half or the northern half of VA up to Harper's Ferry. And I still hope to do another long AT section (or The Long Trail) later in the year. If anything good is coming of this at least I am getting some backlogged chores and yard work done. I am doing what I can to get out on local trails. This weekend I did the Birchtoft Trail and looped together 4 trails at Pisgah State Park. Trail conditions here are predictably a combination of snow, slush, standing water, mud, bare ground, ice, running water, wet rocks and roots, and repeat. Not optimum but at least it's outside. I will be looking for trails I haven't done and also look for an overnight option here in April as well but options are limited this time of year, particularly this year. What a reason for waiting and dreaming of dreams, so here's hoping you've faith in impossible schemes that are born in the sigh of the wind blowing by....-Jethro Tull",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Mon",0
Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627864,"So I will continue to monitor what is going on with the world but now hope to get my section hike started in the middle to northern part of Virginia the 3rd week of May, exact date TBD. I need to figure out some logistics and how to manage transportation and resupply between now and then. A lot of my plan will be contingent on what is happening in the Shennies when I get there. Hopefully the park will open soon. Day hikes continue, despite the best efforts of surly momma bears, black flies, and a nasty mud season. We still don't have many options for entertainment here in NH but getting outdoors and hiking (if not backpacking/camping) is encouraging.More to come but I can't wait to finally get on the trail for a few weeks.“It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door.

I head to Waynesboro, VA on Monday, shuttle to north of Daleville/Troutville where I flamed out last year, walk to Waynesboro, then see what the Shennies have in store and play it by ear at that point. I hope the Nat'l Park is all opened up by them (I have heard a lot about those blackberry milkshakes!). I should be ready in pretty much every way and have been getting in a lot of miles/climbs this spring. I will be using drop boxes to lessen contact in towns.

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628354,"So I am naturally late on my entries...I dropped off my truck in Waynesboro, and caught my shuttle to Bearwallow Gap, near the Peaks of Otter. As I walked from the parking lot to the trailhead I noticed bones scattered on the roadside, including vertebrae. Great. Nothing like starting a solo hike with possible hiker bones scattered around.... I soon made it to the top of Cove Mtn where I got off trail last year, then rode a very smooth and fast trail to about the 5 mile point for lunch--Cove Mtn Shelter. When I got to the picnic table at the shelter in an open exposed cove and dropped my pack it felt as if I wasn't alone so I was alert and determined to not let my pack out of arm's reach. No sooner had I put my pack down and fished out my food bag when I heard a loud crashing heading more me from the hill above. Luckily though what was running out at me was a deer. Thankfully I didn't have to recreate the bear fight from ""Anchorman"" as it veered off. The trail continued to be gentle down to Jennings Creek. It was crashing below and I really hoped there was a way over it after all the previous week's floods. Luckily I hit a road and was able to take the bridge across. I stopped again to hydrate, snack, fill up water, etc. and headed up the trail-and up, and up. As it was getting really hot and humid now that became a problem. At about 3 more miles I was wasted but things leveled out within a couple of miles. Bryant Ridge Shelter finally came into view. It is a luxury hotel with 2 1/2 levels but sits in an area with little in the way of tenting options as it sits near the bottom of a rather unappealing and steep, narrow, muddy wash. I however was motivated to use my tent as this was reputed to be the shelter owned by giant wolf spiders.I later noticed I was having some heat exhaustion issues from my last climb and had the usual dehydration, clumsiness, cramping, and everything else that goes with it.

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628355,"I got out of Bryant Ridge about 7:30 and after drinking water (and Starbuck's Via) and starting out slowly I felt pretty good this morning. It was cooler which helped and the climb went pretty well. I would spend most of this day gaining a great deal of elevation. The trail afforded a lot of variety today--ridges, mountaintops, sidehill, coves, heavily wooded, open, rhododendrons in bloom, everything. There were also remains of gigantic American Chestnut trees scattered everywhere which had all been killed by a fungus from Asia about 100 years of more ago. The plan was to lunch at Cornelius Creek Shelter. About 1/4 mile before the shelter I stepped over a pile of bear poo about the size of a small pony so it would be another relaxing lunch. I would not want to run into whatever bear did that. After stopping I started the long climb up Apple Orchard Mountain. Soon there was a lot of grassy meadow underneath a more sparse cover of trees. About 3/4 of the way up there was a bloodcurdling, ear-shattering scream/bleat about 5 feet to my left. I had passed too close to and scared a little fawn (unless he just having some fun with me). After putting my heart back in my chest I continued up the trail to not upset the fawn and his probably fast-approaching momma any more.The top of Apple Orchard was beautiful, even though I was in a misty cloud and had been for a while. This would have been a great spot on a clear day with an open top, some kind of FAA installation, and New England-like wet rocks on the descent before coming to the Guillotine. After passing underneath (and as a bonus not being crushed), I soon passed over the Blue Ridge Parkway toward my destination-Thunder Hill Shelter. It was complete with a human proof bear box! Knowing a storm was coming in, I decided to drop my belongings in the shelter this time for protection from the weather (which I would come to regret).Later a couple heading north to Maine, joined me for the night--the first people I had seen in two days. As it got dark, my headlight decided that it had lived out its life expectancy which would leave me in pitch black conditions until the morning-perfect!","Bryant Ridge

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628387,"This morning was the wettest I have probably been on the trail to start the day. I had gone into the shelter because I expected a lot of rain. I was right about that but wrong about my decision. What I didn't expect was rain blown wind all night so strong that if I uncovered my head (at the very back of the shelter) I would get showered. My sleeping quilt and a lot of other things were totally saturated, including my now dead headlamp. Much of my food was wet inside of Ziplocks inside of a waterproof food bag. Altogether I think I slept maybe one hour total. I started sleepwalking down the trail in rain jacket and rain pants and headed out--lacking energy, enthusiasm, and coordination. I passed a beautiful view at Thunder Ridge, took a quick break and enjoyed the beautiful view and kept going north on the way to Matt's Creek. However I noticed my phone was draining dramatically and wouldn't last much longer no matter what I did so I called Stanimal's in Glasgow to come get me so I could dry everything out and wash everything including myself. I spent the afternoon taking care of business, took care of my phone issue, chilling, and ordering an excellent burger from Scotto's. There was only one other guest at the hostel and I had a bunkroom all to myself.""And all that I knew was the hole in my shoe that was letting in water.""-Traffic","Thunder Hill Shelter

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628388,"I shuttled back to Thunder Ridge with the idea of walking to the James River. I spent most of the day in either the Thunder Ridge or the James Face Wilderness area(s). It was warm and some of the humidity of a few days ago had returned. Things started off pretty well but Highcock Knob past Petite's Gap kicked my but due to the warm, wet air. I rested and hydrated up top and found the last 2/3 of the day's hike to be pretty easy. This was day 4 on the trail and still I had only seen 2 people backpacking. Today was significant in that I closed up about a 150 mile continuous section of VA. When I started coming down off the ridge, I noted that I hadn't had any real bug issues. I wish I hadn't thought of that because when I got downhill a little, I got eaten alive from before Matt's Creek all the way to the James. Wading Matt's after all the recent rain was interesting. 
Later I talked to Mama Bear back home and there was some business looming that I might need to be available for which is hard to do when backpacking. I will figure that out tomorrow.

Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628418,"I walked N to S today from Punchbowl. The first climb involved a little heavy breathing because of eggs and French toast but once on top of Bluff Mtn, I was good for the day. Views were great today from Bluff Mtn and across to Rocky Row and conditions were perfect, followed by a long descent, then the last push out past John's Hollow Shelter. I did this section once some years ago and it is supposedly where the ghost of a pioneer boy from the 1800's roams around-Little Ottie. He wandered off from home and was eventually found dead up on the ridge somewhere.Unfortunately I am feeling the need to get home and take care of something which isn't possible out here with very limited accessibility. Not a decision I like but I think I need to for peace of mind. Other summer hikes will come into focus soon. I know I will be doing multiple weekend trips, will do the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway very soon, and something like Maine, Whites/Presidentials, or The Long Trail later in the summer. One positive from this week is that I closed off a 150 mile continuous section and now have every foot of the trail from Troutville to Shenandoah. VA will wait on me to finish up the Shennies later and the little bit of southern VA that I still need to do. I might even pick up northern VA/Shenandoah where I left off.As far as new equipment, I think I like the Granite Gear Vapor Trail pack. It is still awkward for me to pack with no top pockets so I don't love it yet but the way it carries and the capacity are perfect. The Altra Lone Peaks are amazing. I can't even feel them on my feet. My toes can breath, no blisters, and great grip on the trail. The REI Active Pursuit shorts and Injinji socks performed well too.

I started south and started running into weekenders but mainly Long Trail hikers. A very few people seemed to be AT thru hikers. The Long Trail and the AT are one in southern VT for about 100 miles when they split north and northeast respectively. I think I am seeing more LT hikers than in prior years. Stopped for water and a break at Lost Pond Shelter, chatted with some other hikers (all LT) and continued to Baker Peak. I got a little fried in the sun so the last easy bit to the campsite as much harder than it should have been as it seemed to suck my energy out.There were a few other backpackers nearby as the area can accommodate multiple tents.

The plan was to have breakfast on the move a couple of miles up the trail. For any coming into VT, there has still been little maintenance this year and there are some big blowdowns. After a stop and about 2 hours in I heard a strange whistle and thrashing off to my left. It sounded like something really large (and nasty) was headed my way-fast. When it got closer I could see that it was a very angry grouse with its tail all puffed out. It came at me and I instinctively used my trekking poles to discourage it (no contact). It veered away at the last second. I thought I must have gotten too near some chicks or something so I kept walking. But the Grouse of Doom wanted to keep coming at me which I believe to be conclusive proof that it was a man-eater. It finally tired of the game and my heart eventually started back up and I realized how comical that must have looked.I then heard that same whistle down the trail 15 minutes later and another grouse came out but this one had the good taste to just try to distract me from its chicks vs feeding me to its chicks.I stopped at the next shelter for a snack, met thru hikers Crispy and Streamline, and continued on back to my truck. I was glad to see that the cooler I had left had been put to good use by passing hikers. ""He's got huge, sharp...er...He can leap about.
