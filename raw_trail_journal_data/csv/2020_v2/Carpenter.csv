Carpenter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626487,"I'm writing this journal from the comfort of the future, where all the pain has faded and only the highlights remain. I am not currently svelte, but I was even less so when I agreed to do a 4 day hike with my friend Mark and our two boys. On top of that, my right quad was strained - something that I spent a month and a half in PT trying to fix when I got back home.
We started the trip by parking at Weaverton Cliffs - our projected end point - and driving up to the parking lot on White Oak Rd at the base of Thruston Griggs Trail. This trail let straight up hill to the AT. I was puffing pretty hard almost from the start. My son, Jack, was breezing right along. Youth is wasted on the young...
We hit the AT at Pogo Memorial Campground and stopped for a snack and a breather. We met a gentleman heading South who was an experienced section hiker and grilled him about his gear choices. I was introduced to Hyperlite Mountain Gear and Starkist Tuna packets in EVOO.
The skies were gray and fog or cloud covered much of the trail. We let the boys pick a spot for lunch and we ended up bushwhacking to a cliff to eat. When we returned to the trail, they saw the blue blaze to the actual overlook they were seeking about 100yards down the trail. Mark and I got to nod knowingly at them in our untested wisdom.
We stopped at Pine Knob for the night, and the rain was coming down. I set up a dining tarp first, then Mark and I set up our hammocks while the boys pitched their tent. The shelter was full, but we hadn't planned on using shelters on this trip. We ate Khorr cheesy noodles and a pouch of Tyson's chicken. The boys filtered water for us and we headed to bed. To be honest, this was the best sleep I had had for a while camping - and would be the best sleep on the trip as well.","Thurston Griggs Trail parking lot

I had just the right clothing for this weather.Slept great last night - but the Seedhouse SL1 has me ducking my head when I try to sit up. Maybe it's the ground pad (~4in thick).

Carpenter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624994,"Pitched my tent on a slight angle, and it turns out I didn't have the straps to connect my quilt to the ground pad. Spent the evening waking up cold. Also, I think my quilt is missing some stuffing - had a couple of big spots that didn't have any loft at all.

Carpenter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626433,"Getting ready for our first major section hike. Met the boys last night at Tony's and hammered out our itinerary. Today I threw on my trail shoes (Altra 4s - they feel like slippers on my feet), new hiking poles, and hiking clothes and headed out to 1st Manassas trail. Had my super mocha (coffee, Nido, hot chocolate, and ghee/coconut oil mix), loaded up with a 32lb weight vest and a day bag with water and a few snacks and did the loop. 5.37miles in 1hr and 45mins.

Carpenter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626451,"I'm going to eat all this food.My concern for this trip is that I'm not sure what to expect - almost all of my recent backpacking trips have been easy weekend trips. Top miles was 10 during my April trip, and even then I came back with lots of food uneaten. Despite this, I know my appetite could very well ramp up on a 8-10 day trip of 11-14mile days. This is also my first time shipping food to a mail drop.My meal plan is fairly simple and repetitive - here the general structure:Breakfast | Snack 1 | Snack 2 | Lunch | Snack 3 | Snack 4 | Dinner | Dessert | After dinner drinkSuper mocha* & Stinger waffle | Trail mix | Energy chews | Tuna & mayo on nori, jelly beans, electrolyte drink | ProBar | jerky | Freeze dried dinner | pudding & Nilla wafers | Hot tea*Via packet, 1/4 cup Nido, hot chocolate mix, ghee & coconut oil - add hot water. This comes in at 435 cal with caffeine, fats, protein, and an excellent taste.",,At home,"Feb 26, Wed",0
Carpenter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626466,"My dad, Michael, took me on my first backpacking trip when I was around 12. It was a scout trip with Troop 456 out of Catonsville, MD. We started at Weaverton Cliffs near Harpers Ferry and hiked north. I don't remember where we stayed or where we left the trail. I do remember hating most of the trip - I had a borrowed external frame and one of those old rectangle sleeping bags with the motif of deer on the liner. Huge quantities of gear was strapped onto the outside of my pack and slapped against my legs with every step.

My dad loved the outdoors, and always shared it with his family. When he was young he was an active scout and loved to camp. When my mom and he were young parents, they carried me all over the country to parks and trails. Camping was a vacation for us - a thing to do for fun. I still remember the feeling of laying on a sleeping bag in the back of dad's van in the early morning as dad and one of my uncles drove from place to place looking for campsites with vacancies (no internet reservations for us).

My dad was a carpenter. He built houses, and on the side did a lot of decks and kitchen/bathroom remodeling. When I was old enough I would go with him to his side jobs and ""help"". Most of the time I would just bring him tools or nails, but as I got older he passed on his skills to me - and to this day I'm more inclined to fix up the house myself than hire out. For a couple years after college I even worked construction on my own - leveraging the talents he passed on to me.

About a year before my first son was born, my dad and I went on a hike on the AT - traveling a short route I had hiked solo a couple of times and really enjoyed. We parked on Shippensburg Rd near Pine Grove Furnace State Park in PA, then hiked up to Tom's Run Shelter. We finished the trip at the parking lot in the State Park. It was the first time I had gone backpacking with my dad since my first time as a young scout. It would also be the last time - he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer a little over a year later. He passed 15 months after his diagnosis.

All of my kids were raised on stories of their Pop. They enjoy the connection they have through scouting and camping - even if my youngest two never got to meet him. My oldest and I went on a 4 day backpacking trip in April of 2019 with my friend Mark, a fellow scout leader, and his son Zach. We planned the trip with a focus on practical goals and proximity to our homes - so it was mostly by chance that the section we chose to hike took us over the same ground I first hiked with my dad as a young scout. On that trip I was close to 225lbs and had a sprained knee - so the agony was nostalgic...

This March, that same friend and I are heading out on our first large section hike with another fellow scout leader (also a Mark - we'll sort that out soon with some good trail names). Again, we chose our path based on practical goals and proximity to home. More to the point - we picked a mid point for a mail drop and worked outward to a start and endpoint from there. It seems like too many co-incidences that our starting leg is the same one my dad and I took on our last trip together.

Despite the misery of my first backpacking trip, something about it changed me. I would pursue backpacking through my teen years and beyond. I would dream of thru hiking the AT, reading journals and books about thru hiking and always choosing gear with the long goal of using it for thru hiking. Suddenly I was in my 40s and had hands full of commitments and responsibilities. One day one of the Marks suggested we start section hiking, and everything inside of me screamed ""YES!!!"". I conferred with my beautiful wife, and all she said was ""You have a chance to do something you've always dreamed of? Let's make it happen!"". So here I am - 20 lbs lighter and perched on the edge of a grand adventure. I wish my dad was here with me. For him, I go by Carpenter.",,The Appalachian Trail,"Feb 27, Thu",0
Carpenter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626526,Met the Marks at the Stone Bridge and knocked out a prep hike. I wore my Granite Gear Vapor Trail backpack loaded with my base gear - about 20lbs without consumables. The Marks took the 1st Manassas Trail loop while I started on 1st Manassas and then hopped over onto the 2nd Manassas Trail. I lunched on Slim Jim’s and trail mix at the head of the Chinn Ridge Loop Trail. When I got back to my car - just as I put my hand on the door handle - my tracker dinged 10.00 miles. Now my legs feel like jello!,,Stone Bridge parking lot,"Mar 01, Sun",10

I had enough of a signal to text Bekah and give her some updatesRocks were crazy - reminded me why this area is called “where boots go to die”I was concerned about the trail runners I’m using with the jagged rocks, but with my lighter pack weight and my prep training - I held out just fineCaught back up with the boys and we stamped into James Fry shelter together.Over and out!","Tom’s Run shelter

Got hissed at by angry geese on the way to breakfastYummy food and great coffee at Caffe 101. Shugs worried us with some acute nausea.Found out the sirens last night were for a house fire at a home probably only 300 yards from where we slept - tragically one resident and one firefighter died in the blaze.Stopped by TCO outfitter store on the way to the trail from breakfast - open but no small canisters Shugs needed (they have them during the main season)I chatted with the employee at the ATC office while the boys got water. They had maps, but my guide pages and old maps are working for now. Couldn’t find my journal to get stamped - keep misplacing that thingFirst section of the trail felt like walking along a neighborhood trail. It was clear it was going to be a hot day, and we were quickly down to shorts and tees.Lots of farmland - but we ended up very exposed. I attached the neck cape to my running hat, but then I remembered my reflective umbrella. The three of us each have one and we spent the day prancing the trail with parasols.
