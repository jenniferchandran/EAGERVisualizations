Buckeye Bif,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551067,"So this is the first entry in my trail journal. About 2 weeks ago, I decided to really make this dream of thru hiking the Appalachian Trail a reality. I have been researching and dreaming of this for probably 10 years, and now, finally, I have decided to go for it. I still have a few years ahead of me, great to plan and get into hiking shape. The reason for my long workup period is because I want to wait for my son to graduate high school. I have tentatively chosen Sunday, March 29th as the start of my NOBO thru hike. As of now, this will be a solo hike, but maybe in the next couple of years I can talk someone into coming with me.  Anyway, I will post various entries as I prepare for this hike, and I can not wait to get started!",,This is really gonna happen,"Oct 30, Sun",0
Buckeye Bif,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551138,"So going about the myriad of decisions regarding gear. There are so many opinions and options. I don't have a lot of hiking experience. I am basically starting from scratch with regards to my gear selection. I do, however, have an ENO Doublenest Hammock that I really do love. I like the idea of hammock camping. I don't, however, relish the idea of sleeping in a hammock under a tarp during torrential rains and/or snow. So, even though I know that hammocks would be lighter, I plan on bringing a 1 man tent. The problem I have is, some nights I would want to sleep in my hammock, or set it up to sit and relax. The thing I'm leaning toward is carrying both. I guess I will have to decide once I have my pack fully loaded, to see what the final weight would be. I plan on buying an Atmos 65 which gives me a load capacity listed of 30-50 pounds. I would like to stay below 40 total with food and water. Only time and practice will tell.",,Decisions Decisions,"Nov 02, Wed",0
Buckeye Bif,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551139,"On the subject of gear, I am by no means an ultra-lighter. I have no desire to sleep out under a tarp on the ground. I still remember how miserable it was for me to sleep in my old shelter half during my time in the Marines. I remember how miserable it was to be out there during a downpour, and having water running under the shelter soaking my sleeping bag. No thank you! I do however want to stay as light as possible. I'm planning on carrying the minimum of clothing. Trying to figure out lightweight, calorie high food, and limiting unnecessary ""comfort"" items. I plan on posting my gear as soon as it's all purchased and tried out.",,Gear,"Nov 02, Wed",0
Buckeye Bif,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551166,"200 days. With a start date of March 29,2020, that gives me 200 days to reach Baxter State Park, and Mt. Katahdin before it closes for the season to overnight camping on October 15. That equals about 10.9 miles per day average. However, if I average 12 miles per day, that is 182 days of hiking, which puts arrival around September 28. That gives 18 days lee way for zero days, or any unexpected occurrences. I read journals and tales from hikers doing 25-30 mile days. I know that in the beginning I would have to limit my miles and take it slow and work into trail shape. I personally like the idea of 182 versus 200. I really don't see myself doing big miles, but I think a nice steady pace is definitely achievable.",,200 days,"Nov 03, Thu",0
