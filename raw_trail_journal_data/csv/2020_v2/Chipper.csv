Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583273,"Can’t believe the time to start my hike is almost here.  I’ll retire on March 9th and then hit the trail on March 23rd.  Should be interesting to see how big the hiker bubble is by then.
It’s been good to read the journals of those that have already started this month. Gives you a better appreciation of the current conditions of the hike and how well folks are doing.
Going for a last equipment shake down hike on Cumberland Island in GA the weekend of March 3rd. After that I should have everything buttoned up equipment wise.  Already sent the clothes I’m taking to Insect Shield to be treated. Good recommendation from a past thru-hiker.","

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583627,"Did a shakedown hike yesterday on Cumberland Island, GA.  If you've never been there, you should consider going.  Nice place, really interesting things to see and do, with lots of well marked trails and good campsites.  You can only get to the island via ferry so it's not very developed, which is a good thing.  It's a National Park and the Park Rangers are very friendly and helpful.Even though I was only staying for one night, my plan was to take everything I was going to use on the AT so I could get some good hiking in with a fully loaded pack.  Plus this would allow me to evaluate my packing style by having to unload/re-load my pack like I would on the trail.The day started out with a 10 mile hike to my campground where I was able to find a spot to set up my hammock and bug net.  I decided to forgo the tarp as it was a beautiful cloudless day with the same for the night.  Temperatures for the night were supposed to get down into the low 50's, upper 40's so I wanted to try some cool open air camping and check out my sleeping quilt, which is rated to 15F.  I have the hammock in a double open ended stuff sack so after putting up the tree straps, it was really easy to put up the hammock.  The only thing that turned out to be a pain, and that I'm now reconsidering, is that I have a Klymit Hammock V sleeping pad instead of a under quilt.  This was the first time I used it with the bug net on the hammock and it was a major hassle.  It did work as advertised but it truly is a beast of a pad.  Using Klymit's pump to inflate it meant that I had to inflate it outside of the hammock and it took me several tries to get it through the bug net and situated correctly in the hammock.  Getting it out in the morning was another ordeal causing me to deflate it twice, once in the hammock and another outside of the hammock before I could put it away.  All I could think of was how much of a pain that would be to do during bad weather.  I had decided to use that pad because it would also give me an option if I decided that I need to sleep in a shelter some night, but not sure it's worth all the hassles for the few times I may use it that way.  Instead I think I'll go back to using an under quilt that I can pack up with the hammock so that I only have one stuff sack for the Hammock/bug net/under quilt and one for the tarp.  That will make it so much easier to setup and take down everyday.  If I'm sleeping in a shelter it will be because it's really bad outside and I'll just have to figure that out when it happens.Other then the sleeping pad, everything else worked great so I'm pretty confident in the rest of my gear.After the initial 10 miles to the campground with my pack on, I hiked an additional 16 miles slack packing (no backpack) exploring the island.  Of course southern Georgia is just as flat as Florida so I didn't get any of the up and downs I will get on the AT, but I figured that hiking a total of 26 miles over the day would be a good physically demanding day.  Plus, I was getting up the next morning at 6am to hike the 10 miles back to the Ranger Station to catch the morning ferry off the island.  Given all the miles I had put in on the first day, I still felt pretty good for the 10 miles out on the second day.  Overall I was pleased with both the conditioning I have been doing to undertake the hike and the gear I've put together, so a good shakedown overall.One thing that was interesting about the hike is that I met one of the wild animals on the island that you normally don't encounter.  Cumberland Island has wild horses that were left by the Spanish explorers hundred of years ago.  I came around a turn and was face to face with one of them.  We stood there looking at each other for several minutes until I finally realized that he had way more time then I did to wait me out as I had a ferry to catch, so I went around him.  He just stood there and watched me go and then went back to eating the vegetation.  It was a pretty interesting way to start the morning.","

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584719,"Today I registered to start my hike tomorrow.  I'm the 1383rd thru hiker to register so far this year.  I weighed my pack and it was 17 lbs without food and water, 27 lbs with food and water. I'm pretty pleased with the weight, especially after seeing several people with packs over 40 lbs.Tomorrow we're planning on getting up early and driving to Springer Mountain with the intent of having Faye walk to the beginning of the trail with me.Had a good discussion with three other hikers tonight (Butch Cassidy, Sundance, and Clamitiy Jane) that are also heading out tomorrow.  Hope they have a good hike and looking forward to seeing them on the trail.Thanks everyone for the words of encouragement.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584783,"Today was my first day on the trail.  Weather was good and other then being a little stiff I'm feeling pretty good.  
Faye saw me off at the parking lot for Springer Mountain. A true bitter sweet moment. Looking forward to starting but sad to see her go.
Passed several hikers coming down from Springer while I was walking up.  One guy was playing music through a speaker and singing along. Definitely having a good time.  
At the top of Springer I met a Ridge Runner named Tom. He said I was the second Tom he had met today.  Small world.  Ridge Runners patrol a section of the trail and check on hikers and make sure we aren't in trouble and aren't abusing the trail.
After signing the registry I officially started my hike at 10:50.  Let the adventure begin and begin it did. I tripped over a root before I had even left Springer Mountain. So much for a graceful start. Luckily the rest of the hike was uneventful.  On my way down I ran into Butch Cassidy, Sundance and Calamity going up.  We stopped and chatted for a few minutes. It was nice seeing them again. 
The weather was mostly sunny and mild so the hiking was good most of the time with only a few sections that were rocky.  Refilled my water bottles a couple of times and chemically treated the water. So far so good.
Made the 8.1 miles to Hawk Mountain shelter in about 5 hours. Passed some hikers along the way that I saw registering at Amicalola Falls on Thursday. There were a lot of day and weekend hikers out enjoying the nice weather.  There are about 20 hikers staying here tonight. 8 are staying in the shelter and the rest of us are in tents or hammocks
Well, that's all for today. I'm safe and warm inside my hammock.","Springer Mountain

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584864,"Well today was a good day, I didn’t fall.  I’ll have to see how long that streak goes.
Got a little bit of rail last night but it was clear when I woke up around 7:30am. Broke camp and was on the trail by 8:45am. It was one of those days where it would be a light rain on and off during the morning. Just enough to make me put my rain cover on and walk a little bit and it would stop.  It stop completely by around 11am.
Ran into some of the Army guys on the trail.  They are from a nearby Army base. They use the mountains for training. There were 4 of them that were out for a run on the trail. Ah to be that young again.  Ran into 2 separate Army groups that were out hiking. They were going the opposite direction as me and both groups stepped off the trail and let me pass them. Not sure they would have done that if they knew I was retired Navy.
Saw another Ridge Runner named Hannah. She was out checking on us hikers.  It’s nice that they have those folks.
Got my first trail magic.  That’s when someone does something nice for the hikers.  There were a group of guys that are hikers themselves and they setup some tents and were serving hotdogs, hamburgers and bbq to the hikers on the trail. Nice group of people just returning something back to the hiking community. I stopped and had a hotdog and chips  everyone was sitting around taking about there past AT thru hikes. It was fun to hear some of there stories.
I was only planning on hiking 8 miles today, but they are expecting temperatures to drop to near freezing Sunday night and Monday with freezing rain. Decided to put in more miles today so that tomorrow I can get into Neels Gap and put up in a hostel and wait out the freezing rain. Tuesday the temperatures are supposed to warm up again. So I’ll get back on the trail then.  Better to be safe then sorry.
I want to have a shout out to my Nieces boyfriend James who is supposed to start his hike tomorrow. Good luck James and enjoy your hike. See you out there.
Well that’s all for tonight. It’s started raining so it’s time to call it quits and head to bed.  I’m safe a sound and dry for the moment. Probably will be hiking in more rain tomorrow.","Hawk Mountain shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584939,"Last night was my first night experiencing a true mountain storm. Shortly after settling in for the night the skies opened up and we got some fireworks with a little fireworks and thunder.  Woke up at 6:30 and the rain had stopped so I took the opportunity to break camp and get on the trail in case it started raining again. Luckily it only drizzled a little bit early on but nothing else the rest of the day.
My hike today took me to the top of Blood Mountain which is the highest point of the AT in Georgia. The view was probably great, except that it was really foggy today and you couldn’t see very far. Coming down from the top I ran into a lot of people walking up to see the view. I hated to have to tell them that the view was fogged in.
Got to Neels Gap about 2:30. Neels Gap is the first civilization you run into on the trail. About 20% of those starting out to do a thru hike quite here.
I had called ahead while I was on the trail today and reserved a cabin for tonight and Monday night. I’ll take my first zero day tomorrow. A zero day is what they call a day when you don’t hike any miles on the trail.
I checked into my cabin and unloaded my backpack so I can let things dry out. The next thing I did was take a shower.  I definitely needed that. Tomorrow I’ll get my clothes laundered so I can start back on the trail all clean and shiny.  I bought a frozen pizza from the store at Neels Gap and had that along with 2 cups of hot chocolate for dinner. Can’t get that on the trail.The store at Neels Gap is also an outfitter and there were a lot of hikers there buying new gear or replacing gear that wasn’t working for them  plus you could duy resupplies for the trail in addition to the occasional frozen pizza that they would cook for you if you were just passing through.  They will also go through your pack with you and recommend items that you should leave behind so I asked them to check mine out.  They weighed my pack and it weighed in at 23 lbs with my remaining food and water.  All in all they said I had a good pack and only suggested some ways to pack it better to save more room in my pack  all that research paid off.
Tomorrow I’m going to spend the day going back over everything in my pack and try to get better organized and more efficient at the things I should be doing in camp. For example, today I cleaned my hands four times because I kept forgetting that I needed to do something that just made them dirty again since the last thing I wanted to do was to eat some breakfast as I left camp to get back on the trail.  Plus I just need to be better at practicing good hygiene but it always seems that the thing I need is packed away somewhere not convenient.
Well that’s all for tonight. I’m safe and sound and very warm in my cabin.","Lance Creek Campsite

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585012,"We’ll, today was my first zero day, and although I can say it was nice to take a break, it was really boring.
Although it was as cold as they predicted, we didn’t get the rain, so although my legs appreciated the time off, it turned out to not be necessary. But, as I said yesterday, better safe then sorry.
In the future I’ll just do Nero days. A Nero is were you hike part of the day, like I did yesterday, spend the rest of the day off the trail and then get back on the trail later the next day. That way you still keeping moving along the trail each day. I’ll safe Zero days to when I truly need a break or I’ve got visitors to spend the days off with.
Today I took my pack to the outfitter here at Neels Gap. They offer to go through your pack with you and recommend items that you could leave behind to lighten you pack.  I got a clean bill of health from them and they spent some time with giving me some suggestions on how to better pack things in my pack to save some room.  There was another guy there that they also were going through his bag which weighed in at 50 lbs.  it was amazing the stuff he was carrying.
While I was at the outfitters I saw a few other hikers that I had hiked with the past couple of days that were also taking the day off.  We’re all planning on being back on the trail tomorrow.
For my friends from across the pond, I think there must be a run on folks coming from England. I’ve hiked on and off with 4 guys from England.
I also want to thank everyone for all the comments that you’ve left. They are greatly appreciated.","Neels Gap

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585090,"I’ll have to admit it felt good to be back on the trail again.  By the time I got packed up and checked out of the cabin it was 10 when I got back on trail.
Although I missed a trail day, my legs were appreciative of having the day off. I felt really good and didn’t have any issues with the 11 miles I did today.
The trail today was pretty good with only a couple of sharp ups and downs.  Most of the trail was along mountain ridges with mild elevation changes.
I ran into my second trail magic today. There were 4 gentlemen that from the beginning of March to mid April they come to Tenasee Gap every Tuesday and Thursday and offer hikers coffee, hot chocolate and snacks. I had a hot chocolate and a Miss Debbie oatmeal cookie.  It was really good. I didn’t hang around long because it got really cold when you’re not walking as it was misty because the clouds were really low. Because of that, there weren’t any views either.
When I got to Low Gap shelter, I ran into Butch Cassidy and Sundance. They told me that Calamity Jane quit after the first day so it’s just the 2 if them hiking now.
I included a picture of the shelter here as it seems that there are a lot of questions about them. This is pretty typical of the shelters. It is about 8 feet deep and open on one side. It will sleep about 6-8 lying side-by-side comfortably, more if the weather is really bad and more people try to squeeze in.
Ant, it just dawned on me that you run this stuff when you do your multi day run on the spine. My hat’s off to you for being able to do that.","Neels Gap

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585173,"Before I get into today, I want to continue talking about the shelters from yesterday. As you can tell, the shelters are pretty small. The shelter last night had 7 guys sleeping in it, yet there were over 30 tents setup around the shelter. The reasons why hikers stop at the shelter isn’t because of the shelter, it’s because there is a privy and a good water source at each shelter. Being able to use a privy in the woods is a sought after commodity.
Most of you know that I’m sleeping in a hammock. It is really nicer then sleeping on the ground even if you’re using a sleeping pad between you and the ground. One of the drawbacks with a hammock is that the hammock itself doesn’t have any insulation underneath it. For me, I’m using an under quilt, which is basically a sleeping bag that the hammock fits in and is surrounded by. If you don’t have something or it’s not adequate, then you get cold butt syndrome (CBS), which is a real pain and very uncomfortable.  Last night I experienced CBS.  When I hooked up the under quilt, I hooked them to the wrong location and it created a gap between the under quilt and the hammock so cold air could blow in. Let me tell you from experience, that there is no way you can sleep with a really cold butt.  It was about 1am when I figured out my mistake and was able to get back to sleep. Won’t make that mistake again.
We’ve all been out here long enough that a morning routine has started around the campsites. First, everyone ask how you sleep, then it’s “how far are you going today” and finally something about what happened over night like “did you hear that strange noise” or this morning it was about the mice that tried to get into some of the tents. This all takes place while everyone is breaking down their camp site.
My goal today was to get to Blue Mountain shelter which was only 8 miles away. I knew it should be mostly a mild hike to get here, so I would get there pretty early in the day. If that was the case then I was going to push on to the campsite on the top of Rocky Mountain.  As it turned out, it was a pretty easy hike and I got there at 1pm. When I got there, I found that Buch Cassidy and Sundance were also there so I sat and chatted with them for awhile.  They were pushing on to the Cheese Factory campsite (so named for a nineteen century dairy farm that used to be there) which was the next site past the campsite on Rocky Mountain that I was planning on stopping at.  When they got ready to push on, I went with them. It was nice to hike with them. We go at about the same pace.  While we were hiking, we hit a steep section of muddy rocks, and of course I slipped and fell on my butt. I was then notified by Butch and Sundance that they had an agreed that whom ever fell first in GA bought the first round of beers. They both pronounced that I owed the first round.
On our way we also ran into some more trail magic at Onicoi Gap. Many thanks to Jet Lag who was providing the magic. It was much appreciated.  I had an orange and some early Easter candy
Just before I got to Rocky Mountain campsite the Clouds started clearing out and the sun made an appearance. That was the first time I’ve seen the sun since last Friday.  Normally it’s been pretty much like the picture I included in this entry. As a side note about the picture, the person in it is a lady with the trail name of Three Socks. She got that name because she has a sock from each of her grand kids sewn on her backpack. I thought that was a pretty cool trail name.
Like I said, tonight I’m staying at Rocky Mountain campsite. The cool thing is that I have it all to myself. Seem no one wants to stay here because it doesn’t have a close water source, whereas the sites before and after this one do. It been kind of cool because as it got dark, I could see all the lights come on across the valley.
Well, that’s all for tonight. I’m currently safe and warm in my hammock.  No CBS happening tonight.","Low Gap shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585237,"For today I thought it would be fun to show you what that all important privy looks like.  It’s not glamorous, but it sure beats digging a hole. The first night I stopped one other hikers admitted that he went to the privy to do his business and didn’t take his toilet paper because he figured they would have some like any other bathroom. He didn’t notice it wasn’t true until it was too late. That was an important lesson.
They all have looked the same so far. We’ll see if that holds true as I move into the other states, but I’m pretty sure it’s a Georgia thing.
Well, today is my seventh day on the trail. I’ve survived a full week. It seems like ages ago that we were staying at the Lodge at Amicalola Falls and Faye dropped me off at Springer Mountain.
Today turned out to be one of those learning experiences. As you remember, I was camping on top of Rocky Mountain. It was really peaceful and quiet, and as it got dark, seeing all the lights come on the other side of the valley. Everything was still well and good when I went to bed, however that all changed drastically about midnight.  That was when the front came through. I was suddenly in the middle of 20-30 mph winds that were roaring over the mountain top.  I even got up at 1am to see if I could move to a spot off the top and out of the wind but that wasn’t a possibility. At 3:30am, I decided that sleep was futile and that I might as well get up and get on the trail. So I packed up and was on the trail at 4:30am hiking by the light of my head lamp. It actually wasn’t that bad. I just took things very carefully when I had to climb over rocks. Around 5:30 am, I even meet another guy about my age going south. We both commented about the wind. I hiked through 2 campsites just before dawn and although I needed water, I didn’t go through looking for it because I would probably just wake everyone up.
Since I started so early I got into Deep Gap shelters pretty early. I was ok with that because they were predicting rail to start around noon from the front that came. I had the shelter to my self for a couple of hours before another hiker came in. One of the things that I forgot to mention about the shelters, is that they also have a picnic table. After I setup my hammock, I got out my food bag and made myself lunch which was Santa Fe Chicken. One of those freeze dried dinners. I would normally have had that for dinner but I was starving. I had only eaten a Cliff bar and some jerky earlier on the trail.  Plus, I was expecting that it might start raining soon so why wait.  I was also able to spread everything out on the picnic table so I could see how much I needed to replenish.  Just as I was finishing up another hiker came in and we chatted for a little while.
With a full stomach and not really haven slept last night I retired to my hammock and took a couple hour nap, which was really refreshing.
When I got up, I found that 7 other hikers had come into camp. One of those was Butch Cassidy (Butch for short). Sundance had pushed on so that he could get his significant other to her car, which was about 3 miles further down the trail. It turned out that Butch had recently retired as a helicopter pilot and had flown helicopters in the Army also. When I told him that I was retired Navy, he mentioned that he had spent several years as a contractor flying supplies to Navy ships at sea. We spent a lot of time telling sea stories, me from the ships perspective and he from the pilots perspective.
At around 6pm the rain finally showed up, so we called it quits and everyone ran back to their tent.  After last night and my early start, that was ok with me.
Tomorrow I’m going to hike the 3 miles to The Top of Georgia Hiking Center where I’ll be able to take a shower (a good thing) and get my clothes washed (a really good thing). They also offer a shuttle into Hiawassee so I can resupply my food. I’ll need to get 5 days worth because I‘m going to try to get to Fontana Village, NC as my next stop.
Before I go, I thought I would take a minute to talk about what I’m wearing.  My base wardrobe is, wool hiking socks, long pants that are wind resistant, a long sleeve wool t-shirt and a buff on my neck. When I’m hiking, I’ll add a wind and water resistant light weight running jacket. When I get into camp, I swap the jacket for a light weight fleece. Yesterday and today were the only days so far that were warm enough for me to just wear the wool shirt alone in the afternoons.
This is probably where you’ll get grossed out. When I go to bed, I sleep in the same outfit with the fleece. I pull the buff up over my ears and the top of my head so that only my eyes and nose are exposed.
Well, that’s probably enough shock for one night. Know that I’m warm and safe in my hammock.","Rocky Mountain campsite

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585346,"The storm that we were expecting lasted only a couple of hours, but it really rained for that short time period. Let me tell you that rain beating down on a tarp just a few feet above your head is pretty noisy. I had brought some earplugs for this situation but had left them packed in my backpack. I have all these mental notes to myself on things to do for certain situations.
Since I was planning on hiking a short distance to the Top of Georgia hostel this morning and spend the night, get my clothes washed and resupply my food. Since check in wasn’t until noon, I wasn’t in a rush.  Butch was being picked up at 9:30 by Sundance so he left early.  We said our goodbyes, although we’ll meet up again on Saturday as we’re planning on stopping at the same shelter.
I still got to the hostel early and figured that I was going to have to sit around until check in. Instead they said that when the bathroom was free I could go ahead and take a shower and give them the stuff I wanted washed.  A hiker had come in just before me and was already taking his shower. They gave me some scrubs to could wear until my laundry was done. While I was waiting for the bathroom to be free I had 2 cups of hot chocolate. It was turning into an excellent morning.
At noon they checked me in and assigned me bunk J-8, which is a lower bunk.  It’s a good thing because I’m too old to climb up and down from an upper bunk, especially if you have to go to the bathroom later at night. The hostel has 3 rooms each with 3 bunk beds. 1 is for the ladies and the other 2 for us guys.  Interestingly enough, there are 4 of us here that are my age and we all ended up in the same room. We called it the elder suite.
After I got checked in and had put away my gear, the shuttle driver took me into Hiawassee. It’s not a very big town, but they do have a good grocery store (Ingles). I went to a Mexican restaurant called Monte Alban and had lunch. They were actually really good. Since I had cell service in town, I called Faye to catch up with her. It’s nice to be able to talk to her instead of catching texts at the end of the day.  Afterwards I went to Ingles and did my shopping. I also got a sandwich from their deli that I would eat for dinner. I got done just a few minutes before the shuttle driver came back to pick me up.
When I got back to the hostel, I organized my food for 5 days. I create a pile of food for each day, then I remove the food from the original packaging and put them into ziplock bags. Next i put each days worth of food into a gallon size ziplock bag. That way in the mornings all I need to do is pull out one bag and I have everything I’ll eat for that day ready available.
Once I was finished with that, I pulled out some stuff from my backpack that I wanted to air out and repacked some stuff.
After that it was time for dinner and everyone started settling in for the night.
Tomorrow morning I’ll get back on the trail and will cross from Georgia to North Carolina. One out of 14 states completed. Lookout Kelly here I come.
We should have good weather for the next several days so that will be nice, and with that I’ll say good night.","Deep Creek shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585450,"Today was an excellent day for hiking. We had blue skies, mild temperatures and just a little breeze.
We all got up around 6:45 this morning and got ready to get back on the trail. There were a couple of people that were going to stay another night, but most of us were heading out. After getting packed up, we had breakfast and then the shuttle driver took us back to the trail. I was hiking again by 8:10am.
Today I was just hiking along and enjoying that the weather was so good, when after a couple of miles I heard a lot of noise ahead of me. Eventually I got close enough to figure out that it was a mother with 2 boys about 10 and 12. All 3 had pretty big backpacks on. Since they weren’t traveling very fast it didn’t take long to catch them. I asked the mother were they were heading (so I could make sure that it wasn’t the same place I was heading to) and she said they were hiking all the way to Maine. I wished they luck and good hiking, but couldn’t help but wonder how she was going to pull that off. The boys were probably bored and I think they were playing a game of who could make the most noise. They didn’t have to worry about any wild animals being within a mile of them. It took a long time before I stopped hearing them.
Around 1pm I hit my first major milestone. I crossed from Georgia into North Carolina. One state down, 13 more to go.  I kind of do North Carolina and Tennessee together, because as I get further north, I’ll spend about 200 miles crossing back and forth across their boards.
I kept playing leap frog with Bear, a young hiker from New Zealand. He was always stopping to talk to people and I would catch up to him and pass him. He would also catch back up to me and I would let him pass. The last time we did it he asked me how old I was. When I told him 63 he said he hoped to be able to hike as well As I was doing. Not s bad complement from someone about 40 years younger them me.
I was planning to hike to Deep Gap, which is just a campsite near a forest service road. A rumor was floating around the trail that there was going to be some really good trail magic that was going to happen there in the morning. When I got to Deep Gap, the trail magic was already going on. There was a group here that for the last 27 years has treated hikers to dinner the night before Easter and then breakfast Easter morning.  After I put up my hammock, I went and checked out what they were doing. They had BBQ, coleslaw, beans or you could cook a sausage over the fire if you wanted. I had 2 helpings of the BBQ, coleslaw and beans. They also had different types of desserts, of which I sampled several.  Tomorrow morning they are doing Omelets, eggs to order and pancakes. This is true magic. We sat around the fire until it was almost dark, and I excused myself as it was time to head back to my hammock.
All in all a very good day with tomorrow promising to be more of the same.","Top of Georgia Hostel

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585548,"Happy Easter everyone.
Well, today was my first full day in North Carolina and it started out with a bang. 
I got up this morning and packed up all my gear. I took my backpack back up to where they had done the trail magic last night and they were getting ready for fixing breakfast.  When I noticed one of their signs that mentioned the 3 lbs omelette challenge, I knew that I was at one of the most famous trail magic on the AT.  It’s headed by Tar Heel (who thru hiked the AT in 1979) and has about 10 other ex thru hikers that help him. I had read about this event in books and journals for years.
One of the ladies gave us menus (that’s correct) for us to order our omelette and sides. You could also order a sandwich and sides to take for lunch. I filled in my order and gave it to the chefs.  As it turned out I was the first one to order and got my picture taken turning in my order.  After I got my breakfast and sat down to eat it they brought me my ham sandwich (had to order my Easter Ham) and Cheetos for the trail. They also had stuff available for us to resupply and I picked up some moisture wipes as I was almost out. I also noticed some BioFreeze packets and gave some to Butch. His hip is bothering him but he can’t take any ibuprofen. BioFreeze is great for inflation.  I topped it all off with some Easter candy to go with my lunch.  It was a great start to the day.
There was a reporter there from Raleigh doing a story on the event and was asking us hikers about what we thought of the event and other trail magic we had experienced. She asked for all my information so Kelly keep a lookout for some kind of article about it.
Before I continue on about my day, I want to say something about this trail magic. These are events that are done for the benefit of the hikers and not just through hikers, but any hiker on the trail that happens to run into it. It mostly occurs in March and April and also mostly in GA and southern North Carolina. There are individuals, groups like today, Boy Scout Troops and Church groups that do these. Most of the time it’s a single event, like today’s, or certain days of the week for a certain number of weeks. The point is that it’s magic because you never know if you’ll run into any. I’ve been lucky and run into several, but if I hadn’t decided to push my distance the second day I would not have seen my first magic. If I hadn’t stayed the 2nd night at Neels Gap, I wouldn’t have seen any of the other ones either. I would have been 1 day off from  being where they were doing their magic.  Will I see any more trail magic?  I don’t know, it’s just a matter of being in the right spot on the trail at the right time. That’s why it’s called magic.
After saying my thanks to all the great folks that put on that feast, I heading back on the trail. Today was another excellent day for hiking. Temperatures were again mild with just a little breeze.
I went about 1.5 miles and came upon the next shelter. I decided to stop, you guessed it, to use the privy. The campsite at Deep Gap didn’t have one.  Like I said, hikers stop at Shelters not for the Shelter but for the privy. After taking care of my morning’s business, I got back on the trail.
The begging of the day was a really nice hike. I hiked through some really cool tunnels of Rhodadendrums; and there were some excellent view points overlooking some great valleys.  I stopped at this great campsite for lunch and enjoyed my Easter Ham sandwich for lunch
Probably because of the trail magic going on behind me, I only saw a couple of other hikers heading north. I saw lots of people heading south throughout the day. Mostly couples or families out enjoying the great weather.
It was after lunch that I hit the hardest part of the trail for the day. We went several miles of going Ip and down (don’t get me wrong, we are always going up a down) where the entire area was full of thick roots and stones. It took me a couple of hours to just do those 2 miles to keep from getting hurt. Speaking of that, this morning we learned that 2 days ago a hiker had to be rescued off of Blood Mountain. He had fallen and broken his leg. It took 8 people to get him down. I had done Blood Mountain a few days before he had. Coming down, there are large sections where there is no trail, as you are more scrambling down over large rocks. In this section the white blaze is just painted on the rocks. There were 3 guys going down with me that tripped and broke a trekking pole but at least no one was injured.
At Carter Mountain I went through an area that had been hit by a forest fire. That was a little surreal.  Eventually I made it to my final destination at Betty Creek Gap, which is just a campsite. No privy but we do have a water source.
I’m looking forward to tomorrow as I’ll hit the 100 miles mark.
Well, that’s all for tonight. Time to turn in and get ready for tomorrow.","Deep Creek Gap

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585606,"LtLast night I camped with Butch and Sundance. Before we headed to bed, we talked about what are plans were for today. Butch and Sundance were planning on stopping in Franklin and taking a zero day, which meant they would then be a day behind me, as I was planning to continue on.  It was kind of bittersweet as I really liked hiking with them, but that is the way it goes on the trail.  It’s still very possible that later on I’ll take some time off the trail and they will catch back up to me.
Since they wanted to get into town at a decent hour and it still was a 12 mike hike, they were planning on getting up at 6 am and getting an early start.  I figured that I could do the same, and get a jump on my miles for the day. Plus it would let me hike with them for one more day.
As it turned out I didn’t sleep that well so I actually got up at 5:45 am and started packing up. When I was finished, I saw their headlights so I headed over. Butch and I eat some breakfast while we waited for Sundance to finish. For me that meant some Trix and a floor tortilla with peanut butter. Breakfast of champions.
Our first event was climbing Albert Mountain, that also where you cross the 100 mike mark. Getting to the top was a real pain. It was several hundred feet that was almost a vertical climb over rocks and wooden log steps built into the side of the mountain.  You definitely had to earn that 100 mike mark. When you got to the top you were rewarded with a beautiful scene.  There is a fire tower at the top that you can climb, but it was to windy and we were too chilled from having sweated getting up there. Instead I enjoyed the view from the bottom of the tower.
As a type of pay back, the next several miles of the trail were a gradual decent down from the mountain top.  After that the trail returned to its normal ups and downs.
I have been getting worried about my hammock because we have been hearing that there is still snow in the Smoky Mountains.  Although I can work on not getting cold while in my hammock, unlike a tent, I don’t have anywhere to put my great, to include my shoes other then on the ground below my hammock. That would mean that I would have to sit all my gear and pack on the snow while I’m in my hammock. That wasn’t going to be too cool a thing to do.  Plus I only had 60 more miles after today and I would be in the Smoky’s. That means I should make it there by next weekend. Based on that I made a decision to also go into Franklin today and see if I could get a good light weight tent to use in place of my hammock. When the weather gets warmer, I can swap out the tent for the hammock.
Butch was dealing with painful feet and Sundance with a painful knee that had been reconstructed. Because of that, they told me to gone on since I needed to get there with time to stop at the outfitters.  I got into town around 2:30 and settled in at Gooder Grove Hostile. It’s a nice place we’re they basically turned a house into a hostel. The bedrooms all have bunk beds as well as the entire basement.
I was able to find a Big Agnes High Volume Ultralight 2 at one of the outfitters here so I’m all set.  I had gone there straight from hostel were I had only dropped my pack. I hadn’t cleaned up and was still wearing my hiking clothes. I know I smelled bad, but since that was the only reason I was in town, I wanted to make sure it got done. Afterwards I returned to the hostel, took a shower and put in some different clothes while mine were finally being washed.  Next I went to this really nice local restaurant called The Sunset Restaurant that the outfitter had recommended. They said I wouldn’t go away hungry and that was that sure was the case as food was really good and plentiful. On my way back to the hostel I stopped at the local grocery and picked up a couple of things for tomorrow.  When I returned to the hostel, I packed away my new tent and collected all the items associated with my hammock so that tomorrow I can mail it back home.
Well, it’s now time to settle in and go to bed as tomorrow will be another day on the trail.","Betty Creek Gap
","Gooder Grove Hostel, Franklin, NC","Apr 02, Mon",12.20
Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585682,"Around 6:30am was when everyone started moving around the hostel. A few minutes later one of the guys came around and told everyone that the First Baptist Church was providing a free pancake and bacon breakfast. Since that is my favorite breakfast I didn't think twice. The Church's van drives around town to the different hotels and hostels picking up hikers. We got picked up around 7:15. you could have as much as you wanted, but I only had one serving. The Minister talked to us and explained that the church does this everyday for the month of April.  When I was done I thanked the Minister and the lady in charge and told them that it was a really nice thing the church did and I really appreciated it.  The van was running people back to were they were staying but I decided to walk so I could chat with Faye while I had good reception.
When I got back to the hostel I still had to box up the stuff I was mailing back to Faye besides re-pack my backpack. Once I got all that done and the shuttle driver was free to take several of us back to the trail, it was around 10am that I started hiking again. Because it was a late start and they are predicting thunderstorms tonight, I wasn't expecting to make it to the next shelter which was 12 miles down the trail. I didn't want to get setup too late as I knew I would need time to figure out the new tent.
About 4 mikes into my hike I came out of the woods into Siler bald (that's a grassy area surrounded by the forest).  Two other hikers were just putting their packs on and they both pointed up the bald which went all the way to the top of the mountain. They said I needed to dump my pack and walk to the top as I would have a 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains.  They also said that there was an artists up there painting. At first I was hesitate because I already had a late start and this would just put me more behind. But then I decided that it was a really good day out with the sun shinning so what would be the chance of doing it again. Besides, that wed,why I was here in the first place, so I dropped my pack and went up to the top. They were right, the view was incredible.
I did talk to the artist. His name is Chris Bell and he's a Middle School Social Science teacher in Franklin. The hikers that sent me up there had thought about seeing if they could buy the picture from him, but they Googled him and found out that he has art in 3 Galleries.  Seems that teaching might be his hobby not art.
After I got back on the trail, I went a couple of more miles and was thinking of stopping at a campsite that I had read about that was supposed to be a few more miles along.  When I checked on it again I realized that it was near the top of a mountain. Not the place to be during a thunderstorm. I went on a little longer and came upon 4 other hikers that had setup camp in an open area were another trail joined the AT so I decided to stop also.  Since I've stopped, 3 other hikers have joined us. We have our own community now.
I went about setting up the tent and didn't have any issues, which was a good thing. Next I made my dinner and chatted with my neighbors. Today was the birthday for one hikers so we sang happy birthday to him.
After that we pretty much all turned in for the night and are waiting to see how bad the storm is going to be. At least the forecast had it ending in the morning.
Well, that's all for now. Time to turn off the lights and lock the doors.","Gooder Grove Hostel, Franklin, NC

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585766,"Well, the storm started about 11pm last night but just as a light rain. About 1am the heavens opened up and the thunderstorm rolled in. It was pretty exciting until about 3am when the lighting stopped.  The rain stopped about 4:30am and it was quite fir the rest of the night. I cam report that I was snug, warm and dry in my new tent.
I got up at 7am and was on the trail by 8.  When I started out, it was real misty and windy. As the morning progressed the clouds started breaking up and the sun was out for most of the day but it was a pretty cold day none the less. 
 I hiked a couple of miles and got to the top of Wayah Bald where there is a cool stone lookout tower in honor of John Byrne.  Although the views from the tower were really great, I didn't stick around because the wind was strong up there and really got you cold quickly.
Since I was walking alone today, I got out my iPod mini and spent several hours listening to some pod casts. It did help the day go quicker

There was one point in the afternoon that I was walking along a ridge line with a really good view of the valley. I checked my map and determined that I could see the lake formed by Fontana Dam. That was pretty cool as I should be there in 3 days.
I go into the Weiser Bald Shelter around 5:30 and picked out my tent site. I hung up my tent on so small trees so that it could dry out Cromer the rain last night while I went and got water. When I got back everything was dry so I put up my tent and fixed dinner.
Tonight the temperature is supposed to get down in the 20's so we'll see how everything works out.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585840,"The morning went by pretty good with one section of the trail going along a spine of a ridge between 2 mountain peaks. The path itself was only about 4 feet wide and the sides dropped straight down on both sides. Luckily the path was pretty clear of obsticals and trip hazards.
I got into Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) around 11:30. NOC is a large complex that does rafting, kayaking, zipline and other things. The AT runs right through the complex. The other reason it is a bug stop for hikers is that it is the last outfitter that you can get things you need before you get into the Smoky Mountains.  I gave Faye a call and we caught up one somethings and then I went to their General store and bought some stuff for lunch. I ate while watching some guys shoot the rapids on a course that was setup.  I took a break there for about 2 hours.  It was pretty nice. There were a lot of non-hikers there enjoying the complex as it really was a nice day out. 
When I got back on the trail, I had 6 miles to go to get to the shelter I was planning on stopping at. Unfortunately it was all up hill. That Wes the longest climb I had had is far.  When I got to the shelter I was beat. I setup my tent, cooked dinner (instant mashed potatoes with chicken mixed in). It was pretty tasty. After that, I climbed into my tent prepared to call it quits for the night.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585986,"I got up this morning and got on the trail by 8 am, knowing that the chances were really high that I would get rain before I got to the next shelter. I actually was able to get in about 3 hours of hiking before the rain started. The weather forecast had called for rain most of today, starting late morning and into tomorrow morning and that seems to be what I’ve gotten so far. 
It didn’t rain constantly, but came and went. Alternating between a drizzle and a good rain. It gave me an excellent opportunity to try out my Apacka, which is a combination pack cover and rain jacket. It worked really well and has lots of zippers to open to help with ventilation so I didn’t overheat. 
Unfortunately as I was going over some rocks, my foot slipped and although I didn’t fall, the hiking pole I had in my left hand caught the brunt of the fall and the pole cracked right below the handle. I could still use it but I knew it would be a matter of time before it broke completely. About 2 hours later the handle finally broke completely off. I stuffed the handle in my backpack and was able to keep using it as it had a foam grip that was below the handle. They are guaranteed against breaking so when I get into Fontana Dam Village tomorrow, I get a hold of the manufacturer and workout where to send the replacements. 
Luckily I got to the shelter in a little bit of a lull in the rain so I was able to setup my tent only in a very light drizzle. Right after I got it setup and everything inside, it started raining harder and has continued that way ever since. I debated on taking my food to the shelter and cook dinner, but decided against it. Last night, one of the guys we were eating with said he was going into a nearby town today and wanted to get rid of a bunch of extra food he had, so he offered it up to us. I took 5 tortillas and 3 packages of tuna fish so I decided to make 3 tuna fish sandwiches instead of wandering around in the rain to cook dinner.
I’m hoping that the rain will stop before I hit the trail in the morning, but since I’m stopping in Fontana Dam and spending the night off the trail, I’ll have a chance to let everything dry out there.","Sassafras Gap Shelter
",Cable Gap Shelter,"Apr 06, Fri",15.20
Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586041,"Luck was with me again, and although it rained all night long, it stopped raining a little before I got up. Don’t get me wrong, my tent was all wet and muddy on the outside but at least I wasn’t getting wet putting my tent away.
The 7 miles from the shelter to Fontana Dam was almost all down hill, put leave it to the AT to still make that a challenge. There were sections that were incredible steep and rocky and I definitely had to pick my way down very cautiously in those sections because of all the rain.  Just before I got to Fontana Dam I ran into a south bound hiker named Ox that lead the trail maintenance group for this section. He was heading up to one of the worst steep down hill sections to mark out a new path that would zig zagged down that section making it less dangerous.
I got into Fontana Dam and called Fontana Village Resort to have their shuttle pick me up. To be honest, Fontana Village is really just the resort. It’s one of those wedding destinations and has a lot of outdoor activities when the weather is much more agreeable. Plus it’s one of those lakes with a lot of house boats, so the resort also has a marina. At this time of year, pretty much all the guests are hikers.
I got to the Resort a little before 1pm and as you can guess, my room wasn’t ready.  They let me store my backpack in the back office and I figured that I would use the time to go ahead and go to the laundromat and wash my clothes. Before I put my backpack in the back office, I pulled out the clothes I would wear while washing my other clothes.  I had hoped that I could have taken a shower before I put on my other clothes, so I’m unashamed to say that instead I did a kind of sponge bath in the restroom. At least it cut some of the smell.
It turned out to be a good thing that I did that and headed to the laundromat instead of waiting until I got checked in. Of the 6 washers and 6 dryers, only 1 washer and 2 dryers were working. I was fifth in line for the washer and at 40 minutes a load I was there for awhile. All the hikers were pretty nice and would take turns holding each other’s place so we could grab lunch, and a couple of hours later I also checked in where I quickly pulled out my tent so that it could start drying.  It was fun sitting around with a bunch of other hikers and talking about the trail. I was really surprised that most of the hikers started several days to a week before I did. I didn’t think I was putting in that many miles but it seemed I was, at least by their standards. 
Once I got my laundry done I finally got my shower and headed out to dinner. Then I came back to the room and sorted out the mail drop of food that Faye had sent me - thank you very much.
My plan is to leave tomorrow morning and hike straight through the Smokey Mountains over the next 6 days.  Tonight it’s supposed to be below freezing and remain cold tomorrow, but the rest of the week looks like it will be pretty decent.  Looking forward to some decent weather for awhile. So far I’ve had more cold and foggy days then not, but it is early spring in the mountains after all.","Cable Gap Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586176,"When I got up thus morning I had planned on taking another shower but decided against it (big mistake that I'll explain later).  Instead I packed and ate breakfast and went to the lobby to wait for the shuttle to take is back to the trail.  So far everything was good.  The shuttle driver had dropped me, it was a chilly but nice morning and it was a nice scenic walk across the dam. It wasn't until I had gone about a mile that I turned around to take a picture across the lake and faced the sun that I noticed that the brow of my cap wasn't keeping the sun out of my eyes because I wasn't wearing it. I had washed it last night and hung it in the shower to dry. I had to walk back to where the shuttle had dropped me off and wait for him to return since I didn't have service to call him. At least one thing went right for me and he was still there having just dropped off some other people. He took me back to the Resort but housekeeping had already done my room and put my hat in lost and found. I finally tracked down and was soon back on the trail, although an hour later.
Once back on the trail, the first 4 hours were all uphill.  A long the way I ran into 2 couples that had started this morning from Fontana and were going to spend the week hiking north through the Smoky's. The thing that initially caught my eye about them was that they had stopped to take a cigarette break. Not that I'm saying that smokers can't be hikers, it's just that it was the first time I had seen anyone smoking on the trail.
About mid day, things got a little interesting in that we started getting rained on by ice. Temperatures had warmed up enough that the ice on the trees was melting and falling off the trees.  It was like being in a hail storm. 
One other thing that I figured out was that the Smoky's were in spring thaw.  While rocks and roots were the things that were the issued earlier, it was now mud. The trail was thick in mud and thus very slippery. Rooks and roots were now the good guys because they gave you traction in the mud.
Tonight is my first night sleeping in a shelter.  In the Smoky's you have to sleep in shelters and can only put up your tent when they get full. The shelters here are bigger and can hold a dozen people. It wasn't full when I got here so I got a spot. There was a Ridge Runner that is staying here tonight and he was checking everyone's permit.  You have to have one to camp in the Smoky's.  As a thrust hiker, my permit is only good for 8 days. Shouldn't be a problem as I'm planning on being through in 6 days.

There weren’t any really bad snores in the group that you hear about keeping the whole place awake, and no one yelled at me so I wasn’t the snorer keeping everyone else awake. Plus, it rained for most of the night, and was still drizzling when I got up, and I didn’t have to put away a wet tent. So far so good that is until we started looking outside. 
I did say that it had rained for most of the night, and rain makes....wait for it......mud. If I thought hiking in the mud yesterday was bad, it was a walk on the beach compared to what we had to walk in today.  It didn’t help that it stayed a damp mist until early afternoon or that the high today was only in the mud 40’s. For the most part I was walking in mud that at times was deeper then my shoes. It made it hard to keep your feet warm because they were always getting wet from the mud.
I only had to hike 12 miles today to get to the next shelter and it took me 9.5 hours to do it. Not because the trail had harder ups or downs then other sections so far, it was just that it was that hard to walk in the mud.
When I made it to the shelter and was making dinner, I talked to several people that stayed in the last shelter with me and we all agreed today’s hike was probably the worst day so far in trying to make any time on the trail.
Tomorrow it is supposed to clear up weather wise and get into the upper 50’s. We’re all hoping that it will help dry up the trail some. Well, we’ll see if that happens.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

I will have to say that the trail was dryer then yesterday. My shoes didn’t look like a clump of mud anymore.  You could actually tell I was wearing shoes. 
The highlight of today was going to the top of Clingman’s Dome which at 6,643 feet is the highest point in the trail.  There is a tower at the top with a distinctive winding path to the top.  The view was incredible since the sky had cleared up. The mountains stretched out for ever. You also could see all the way west past the Smoky’s to Gatlinburg and beyond.  Clingman’s Dome was also the 200 mile mark. That’s another 100 miles down.
Got to the shelter and was able to setup in the shelter. This shelter has a fireplace and some of the guys had built a fire so we’ve got a little heat going

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586457,"Being at a higher elevation in the Smoky’s means that the temperatures are colder. This was evident when we got up this morning, for all though it had warmed up yesterday, it had gotten below freezing overnight. One thing that is nice about that is that also means that the mud is frozen.  I’ve also learned to appreciate staying in the shelter when it gets below freezing as it’s harder on your hands to take down the tent and pull up the stakes.
Once I got on the trail, I had gone a couple of miles and came to a point where the AT goes by a parking lot and there were 2 ladies providing some trail magic. They had a basket of Tangerines, pastries, Kool Aid drink pouches and some other treats. They are both Section hikers from around Gatlinburg that hike through the Smoky’s a lot.  I had a tangerine as I hadn’t had fresh fruit in a while.  About mid morning I came to where the AT crosses US 441 at Newfound Gap. This is were most hikers that are going into Gatlinburg get picked up. A lot of the hikers that I had been going through the Smoky’s were stopping here and getting rides into town.  What I didn’t realize was that this was the point that the AT leaves North Carolina and enters Tennessee, so I’ve officially entered my third of fourteen states.  It’s not as big a deal as it might seem because for about 200 miles we’ll cross back and forth between the 2 states.
The afternoon was a delight of grand vistas. It was almost like the Smoky’s were trying to make up for that day of mud. A lot of the afternoon I would be walking on mountain ridges, and what I mean by ridges is that the path would be about 6 feet wide with incredibly sharp drop offs on either side. When you were on these ridges, on my left I could see the western edge of the Smoky’s and into and beyond Gatlinburg. To my right was a view deep into the Smoky’s and a skyline of never ending mountain tops. It was a beautiful clear day with almost no haze so the views stretched for miles. It definitely made up for all the earlier mud.
As a side note. You’ve probably noticed that my postings have been taking place the next day. That’s because I’ve had really bad service with both AT&T and Verizon while in the Smoky’s. I usually stop multiple times during the day and check my phones. Every once in awhile service will pop up and I can upload my entry.  I eventually get it so bear with me in the delays.","Mount Collins Shelter

Someone had gotten a weather report and it was supposed to be in the upper 60’s. I don’t think I could argue with that.  It was probably one of the nicest day I had so far.
Most of the day the trail stayed around 6,000 feet so it was really pleasant. I was still able to hike in just my shirt for the first time in the Smoky’s, and when we went to lower elevations I could have been hiking in my shorts.
If I thought that yesterday was a good hiking day, today topped it. It was a combination of walking through old growth pine forests and more ridge lines like yesterday.  Today it was more hazy so the views weren’t as limitless as they were yesterday, but still spectacular.
Ran into a Ridge Runner today but can’t remember her name. When we were going through orientation at the Ranger Station at Amacalola Falls they showed us a tent that a bear had shredded while the Ridge Runner was in it.  That was her tent.
Well, this is my last night in the Smoky Mountains.  It’s been interesting as everything that I’ve packed has been with the Smoky’s in mind and how bad it could get. Other then the first 2 days (the second day has been officially named “The day of the mud”) the last 3 days have been almost perfect.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586645,"Well, today I departed the Smokies. I’ll have to admit that although it was a hard hike it’s been my favorite so far. It’s like it throw 2 nasty days at us at first to make sure that we showed the proper respect and then rewarded us with the 4 most gorgeous days I’ve had so far and the most fantastic views.
For a last day, things were really interesting. Shortly after getting back on the trail I had a bird fly between my hiking pole and my leg. I actually felt it’s wing on my leg. I guess I must have gotten close to it’s nest.
Next I took a side trail for half a mile to check out the Mt. Cammerer Lookout Tower. To go a mile round trip off the trail it had better be worth it and it was. The Lookout was built in the 1930’s by the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) to be used to watch for forest fires in the Smokies.  The views from the top were awesome.
Further on I ran into a young lady going South and noticed that she had a yellow AT tag (the AT tags for 2018 are red) I asked her if she was a south bound thru hiker and she said yes. She had started last June but had to take several months off because she had micro fractures in one of her foot.  When I congratulated her on being within a few weeks of finishing she said she was doing 25-30 mile days and would be done in 10 days. When I mentioned that she was entering the Smokies she said “nothing that I haven’t already seen”. I’ll guess we would say the same thing at the end of our hike.
In the afternoon I ran into 3 guys my age that were doing the Smokies from North to South.  The last guy stopped and said I looked familiar and asked my name. When I told him my trail name is Chipper he said that he remembered me from when he did some trail magic back in Unicoi Gap in GA (that would have been back around day 5) and he said that he has been following my trail journal. I told him I hoped it was ok and he said it was enjoying it. I also thanked him again for the trail magic and that it was greatly appreciated.
The last thing for the day was just after coming out of the Smoky National Park, there was a guy setup doing some trail magic. He had a cooler of drinks and some snacks. He’s a Biologist that goes into the Smokies once a week to check on the climate and tree growth and he spends the rest of the day doing trail magic. He does it year round and said that he’ll see hikers throughout the winter, not many but still they’re there.  He said they are becoming more common then in the past.
I knew I was back in civilization because about 2 miles further on the trail crosses under I-40. Interesting to see all the tract again.
About a mile from there, I stopped at Standing Bear Hostel for the night. After 6 days it was nice to take a shower and wash my clothes.  Tomorrow I can start fresh for the 2 day hike to Hot Springs, NC where I’ll spend another night off the trail, get my replacement hiking pole and the re-supply box Faye sent me to cover the next 6 days after that.","Crosby Knob Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586907,"First full day out of the Smokies and people had said that it would be a little easier going. I think that’s turning out to be true because I did a 15 mile day today and didn’t feel bushed at the end. Still had ups and downs, but the trail wasn’t full of rocks like it was in the Smokies and in GA.
Things are different here then they were in the Smokies. Given the lower altitude and the warmer weather, the forest is turning more green here. There was one section were I came upon a field full of these little white flowers. There were so many of them that the ground looked like it was covered in snow.
Had some more trail magic today. Stiles (thru hiker 2 years ago) and her sister had setup a cooler with sodas and beers, a basket of fruit and some cupcakes.  I had a cupcake and took a tangerine for later, which I eat with dinner.  They said that they were surprised that there hadn’t been as many hikers come through as they thought. They were expecting a bigger bubble of hikers by now.
A couple of miles further on I came to Max Patch Mountain. The top of the mountain was a bald, which means that it is all grassy with no trees. As I was walking up to the top I noticed a ton of people also walking up.  When I got to the top there was close to 30 people up there. I talked to a couple setting up a tent and they said that when the weather is good a lot of people will go there to camp under the stars. It helps that there is a parking lot close to the top.  The view there was really good so I can see why people would come spend a Saturday night there. To the south you could see the Smokies and to the north I could see what’s ahead of me.
Got to the shelter and got settled in for the night. There are about 17 people staying here tonight. A decent size crowd but not as many as there had been before getting into the Smokies. Seems to be thinning out a little bit.
Tomorrow I’m planning on hiking another 15 miles to the next shelter before Hot Springs, but it’s suppose to rain pretty heavy tomorrow and get colder so I may hike a couple of more miles and just go on into Hot Springs.","Standing Bear Hostel

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586908,"Today did indeed turn out to be a wet one. It stated to rain around 2am, stopped for awhile, then started again after 4am and kept on throughout the morning. I decided to go ahead and hike on to Hot Springs and not stop at the shelter. Seemed that others came to the same conclusion.  We were all trying to make arrangements for a room for tonight given the shaky cell service. I would get a connection that I could use to text but not strong enough for a call.  So I text the information to Faye and she was able to make a reservation for me (thank you very much).
There really wasn’t anything about today’s hike of any real interest, as it rained all day, the temperatures started dropping and any views were covered in a heavy mist.  Instead I just concentrated on completing the 18 miles as quickly as possible.  Even given the weather conditions, I made pretty good time and arrived at Hot Springs by 5pm.
Hot Springs is the first of several towns that the trail goes right up the middle of town.  It’s not a very big town. The Hot Springs Resort seems to be the big draw here. You can go there and soak in the hot mineral springs that the town is named for. I may have to look into that myself tomorrow since I’m taking a zero day here.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586966,"Well today was my second zero (no miles hiked that day).  I did have to checkout of the Spring Creek Tavern and Inn and check into the Creekside Court. That turned out to be a pretty easy thing to do because they are next door to each other.  It’s a nice but small place with only 6 rooms. The housekeeper turned out to also be the Manager when I asked her how I checked in because no one else was around. She asked my name and said I was officially checked in. Since she was in the process of cleaning my room, I took the opportunity to try to find the laundromat.
Given that this is truly a hiker town since the trail goes right through it, I couldn’t believe what I found. There were only 3 working washers and no working dryers.  Another hiker that was there said that she was going to hang her wet clothes to dry back where she was staying.  When I got back to my room, the housekeeper was jus finishing and I mentioned the state of the laundromat to her and she said it was a sore spot with the community but it has an absentee owner that’s letting it go to waste. She then offered to let me use one of her washer and dryers when she was finished with her laundry in a few hours but to not let others know.
Since I had some time on my hands, I went and retrieved the food drop that Faye had sent me (thank you Faye, I bought some cheese and peanut butter crackers to fill in for the Cliff bars) and the replacement hiking pole that had broken just before I went into the Smokies.  I went back to the room and spread out all the food and packed them into individual gallon bags, one each for the next 6 days.
After a little while, the housekeeper knocked on my door and told me I could do my laundry now. She took me to the laundry room and showed me where everything was. She warned me that I would need to hangout by the door as it locks from the outside and she was going home, so I couldn’t let the door close completely or my clothes would be locked in for the night. I asked her if it would be ok if I hung out in the laundry room and she said that would be fine, so I went back to my room, grabbed all my clothes and my rain jacket and locked myself in the laundry room.  I stripped off everything I was wearing and put on my rain jacket (which comes down to my knees, so sorry no show) and for the first time since I had started hiking would have everything I owned cleaned.  Once everything was cleaned I got dressed again and returned to my room. 
Weather wise it turned out to be a good thing that I had planned on staying here today.  It continued to drizzle or a light rain for most of the day while the temperature continued to drop. At about 4pm the rain turned to snow, which is supposed to continue to fall until later tonight.  At dinner I heard a couple of the locals mention that there already was a couple of inches that had fallen at the higher elevations.  At least the weather report shows the temperatures getting back above freezing early tomorrow morning and having a high near 50. The next day it’s suppose to get into the upper 60’s.
Well, that’s the news from the big city of Hot Springs.  Tomorrow it’s a return to the wilds of the trail.","Hot Springs

I had not planned on getting back on the trail until around 10am this morning to give some time for the temperatures to get above freezing.  It did turn out to be a nice day in the end, with the temperatures getting up near 50 and sunny.
There was a lot of up hill climbing after leaving Hot Springs, but near the top there was a Lookout point where the whole town was laid out below you. Though it did seem to take a long time before the town was completely out of view.
After a few miles, I came upon this lake up in the mountains. It wasn’t a big one but very picturesque.  Another hiker came up behind me while so was admiring it and we both stopped and took some pictures of it.  A little later, the same hiker and I came upon a guy who was out hunting turkeys. He had just shot one and was taking it back to his truck. While we walked with him he recounted how he was able to shoot it.  He was going to take it home and cook it on his smoker.
I finally got to the shelter I was planning on stopping at, but it was only 5pm and I knew there was a campsite in 2 more miles so I pushed on instead of stopping early. When I got to the campsite there were 4 other people that had decided to do the same thing. After I setup my tent, I joined them as we all fixed our dinners and talked about the crazy weather yesterday. They had all taken 2 zero days in Hot Springs because of the rain on Sunday and then the snow yesterday.  Seems like they have done that a lot because when they asked me when I had started and I said March 23, they were surprised because they all said they had started March 12.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587212,"Today I think was the warmest day that we’ve had so far. It was warm enough when I got up this morning at 6:30am that I put on my short sleeve shirt and shorts.  I was totally comfortable all day. Luckily there was a decent breeze for most of the day which would keep you cool. When there wasn’t a breeze it was hot in the sun. 
The day started out as a normal day with the trail being the same as it has been the past few days.  Then things got interesting. About mid day I hit a section that started with a sign saying “Exposed ridge for next 1.5 miles, take bypass in bad weather”. I didn’t think anything of it because I had hiked a section of ridge lines in the Smokies.  It turned out to be nothing like the Smokies.  In fact it was the hardest section of hiking that I had done so far.  For the next 1.5 miles I climbed up, over, around and down large boulders and rocks.  In some places I had to drop my hiking poles below me and then slide down rocks, or toss my poles above me and climb up a rock face. Not an easy thing to do when you have on a 25lb backpack.  I was really glad when I finally got out of that section. When I got to the shelter, that was the talk of the evening.
The real highlight of the day was that I crossed the 300 mile mark. It actually kind of surprised me as wasn’t even paying any attention to the fact that I was close to that mark. When I meet my daughter Kelly in a week I’ll be a few miles short of 400 miles.  Things seem to be picking up speed.
One of the drawbacks to having taken that day off in Hot Springs with the bad weather is that it seems a lot of people did the same thing. Because of that I’m back in the middle of a large hiker bubble.  At the shelter tonight there are around 30 tents setup.  I haven’t had this many hikers around me since the first week I started.  It’s going to take a long time to thin this group out.","Little Paint Creek Trail Campsite

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587279,"Today couldn’t have been any more different then yesterday. During the night the wind picked up and it rained for a little bit but I didn’t think much of it, that is until I started getting up.  The temperatures had dropped to near freezing, it was windy and a heavy mist everywhere. The high temperature for the day didn’t get much over 40. Instead of wearing a short sleeve shirt and shorts, I was back in long pants, long sleeve shirt and a jacket to stay warm even while I was hiking.
Today I actually hiked with someone. Compass, a lady in her 50’s, and I were passing each other at the start of day. When I passed her for the second time she asked me if she could hike with me and I said sure.  During the course of the day I learned that she is thinking of dropping out, or at least taking 2 weeks of until a couple of her friends that are hiking can catch up to her.  Seems she hates hiking alone. She had a couple that she was hiking with, but she took 3 days off in Hot Springs to deal with an ingrown toe nail and they went on without her.  There is lots of reasons why people quit and loneliness is one of them. Even though there are a lot of people on the trail and I get passed or pass someone during the day, most of the time I’m hiking all by myself. I’m fine with that, and actually kind of like it. That way I can set my own pace and how far I’ll go.
Speaking of that, today was also one of those days where there wasn’t any real crazy sections and the miles went by really quickly.  When I got to the shelter it was only 4pm and I didn’t feel like stopping so I said goodby to Compass and wished her luck in which ever direction she took and kept on hiking. I knew there was a campsite about 6 more miles and I was pretty confident I could make it there by 7:30, which I did.  That made today my first 20 plus mile day.  Not sure I’ll be able to repeat it in the next couple of days because there are some high mountains coming up. After that it won’t be until Vermont that we start having those kind of climbs again.
One other thing that was kind of fun was that I crossed underneath I-26 today right at the NC/Tennessee boarder.  When I came out of the woods on one side I could see the welcome to NC sign and on the other side was the welcome to Tennessee sign.  I’ve spent days walking along the boarder of the 2 states, but it was fun seeing their signs across from each other on the highway.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587445,"I continue to be mystified by the weather. It was 25 degrees when I got up this morning. I started hiking with ever layer on that I owned except for my long underwear.  By mid day I was down to my short sleeve shirt and long pants.
The first 5 miles of the day were at or above 5,000 feet where there was still snow and the ground was frozen.  I could feel the cold through the bottom of my shoes.  The highest point was Big Bald Mountain (see picture). The thing that was disappointing was that I’m standing on this mountain top and there are houses within a half mile of me.  So much for being away from civilization.
After the first 5 miles of going up, pretty much the rest of the day was going down. I think that going down steep declines is my least favorite part. It’s jarring on the knees and I spent so much time leaning back to balance my backpack that my back started hurting after awhile.  I had to stop and take off my backpack a couple of times to give my back a rest.
As it was, I still was able to put in a 20 mile day. It’s getting easier to do because it’s not getting dark until 8:30. When you start hiking at 7:30 am it makes for a long time to hike, and since I’ve gotten my hiking legs I’m not bushed at 4-5pm anymore.
I was going to stop at a shelter that was a few miles from Uncle Johnny’s Hostel which is on the outskirts of Erwin, TN (the trail passes within a mile of Erwin). Since I still had a couple of hours of daylight I decided to go on and see if I could get the food drop that Faye had mailed me.  That way I could get my food in order and still get back on the road early in the morning.
As it turned out, I got here a little after 8pm and Uncle Johnny’s had closed up the office and left at 8pm. As luck would have it, Compass, that I had hiked with the other day, had gotten a ride in yesterday because her ingrown toe nail was indeed infected. She had gone to an emergency care clinic and they told her to give it a break for a week.  She had made arrangements with Uncle Johnny to work for stay for the week.
She saw me standing on the deck talking to some other hikers staying here about what the options were and she grabbed me and showed me to a bunk and dug up a towel so I could take a shower.

As it was, I was away at 9:30am. 
It was another really nice day and I was back in short sleeves and shorts. The first part of the trail was nice because the trail went alongside a nice stream with various waterfalls. The trail would cross back and forth over the stream and you could hear the babbling of the stream for a long while.
The real highlight of the day came at 3pm when I got to attend a wedding of 2 thru hikers (Thirsty and Hungry who met while thru hiking in 2015 and are thru hiking again this year) who got married at Beauty Spot Gap.  They were staying at Uncle Johnny’s Hostel last night and told everyone that we were invited to their wedding.  My timing worked out perfectly and I got to Beauty Spot Gap at 2:55pm. It was a nice service with the trail running right down the middle. The couple stood on each side of the trail during the ceremony.  They even took a wedding picture with the newlyweds and all the hikers in attendance.  It was kind of nice to be able to attend as that’s not something that happens everyday.  I didn’t stick around for the reception (there was a parking lot nearby that the caterer used) as I still had 5 more miles and another mountain top to go over to get to my next shelter.  There were a lot of hikers that had already put up their tents nearby so they could enjoy the reception.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587699,"Today was driven by the intent of getting over the last mountain over 6,000 feet. The forecast calls for rain starting tomorrow so I thought it best to get on the other side and have an easier hike tomorrow.
The goal was Roan Mountain which peaked at 6,190 feet. As it was, I stopped at the next shelter which also happened to be the highest shelter on the AT at 6,186 feet.  The thing about this shelter is that because of the high altitude it actually is built like a house with a front door instead of only having 3 walls like the rest of the shelters.
Getting here was pretty interesting as it was an overcast day and the closer I got to getting to the top of Roan Mountain the more I could see that the clouds were below the peak.  Eventually I got to the height of where the clouds were and I would be able to see them swirling thru the trees.
Having climbed Roan Mountain, the next highest peak is Mount Rogers at 5,729 feet which is the highest peak in VA. We hit that just after Damascus, so within the next 2 weeks. After that we don’t get into anymore higher elevations until Vermont.

The wind picked up and it started to rain. With the door closed to the shelter we were snug as bugs inside. Unfortunately, at some point we were going to have to leave and deal with the storm.
I was planning on only going 7 miles that day and stay in an old barn converted into a shelter, which would leave me 7 more miles to complete tomorrow when I would get picked up by Kelly.  The problem started with the fact that those 7 miles would be between 5,500 to 6,000 feet. I would still be walking in the clouds, but now they were storm clouds.  With them came a temperature at 40 degrees, driving rain and gale force winds.  To make matters worse, over the past 30 days, I had only come across a handful of bald s (treeless mountain tops and ridges) while today most of the first 11 miles were balds. I can say that having been in tropical and hurricane force winds before, I never felt any winds as powerful as I did today. There were times when all I could do was to hunch down to keep from being blown over let alone continue to keep walking.  I looked like those guys from the Weather Channel doing a report from some place being hit by a hurricane.  The force of the wind make the rain sting even through my clothes. It was the first time I truly became worried about hyperthermia.
After struggling the 7 miles to the shelter, I realized that as with mist barns, there was a gap between the wall boards so it was really drafty and cold inside. I knew I wouldn’t really dry out or warm up, plus I had found out that the weather would continue into tomorrow.  With that (and having a signal) I contacted Kelly to see if she might be able to pick me up today instead of tomorrow. As it turned out she had decided to come to Boone a day early so she had no problem with picking me up.
I will have to say that today was the most physically exhausting day I have ever had with fighting the wind in the open for miles on end.  It left me drained, soaked and chilled to my bones.  I’m just glad that Kelly was able to come to my rescue and tonight I’m sleeping in a warm hotel bed.","Roan High Knob Shelter

Since the weather prediction was for more rain to start mid-afternoon and rain through the night, I wasn’t planning on trying to get in some long miles today. The first shelter was in 9 miles, but the next shelter was 10 miles further. I figured that I would aim for the closer shelter and see how things were progressing. Given the later start today, doing 18 miles would make it a late day.  As it was, I got to the first shelter at 3:30 and it had started to rain a little so I figured I would stop.  3 other hikers had already done the same and another one came in a little later them I did. Not long after that I really started to rain, so we all figured we had made the right decision.  Over the next couple of hours 4 other hikers came in to get out of the rain. This is a nice shelter with 3 levels so it can hold 12 hikers.
Some of us (me included) had heard that the rain would stop early morning and others around mid day. All of us agreed that once the rain stopped it was supposed to be really nice well into next week.  Almost all of us had come off a zero yesterday and thought it best to do short miles today and get in longer miles with the better weather, especially since we had just spent the time to dry everything out.
As I was hiking you could still see remnants of the heavy rain over the past 3 days. There were sections of the trail where there was still water running down the trail line a mini river, and low areas still with large ponds then little puddles.  With a couple of days of nice weather, the trail should dry up nicely as we’ll remain at lower elevations for awhile.","Boone NC

Woke up this morning and although it wasn’t raining, it was that damp mist covering everything.  It took a couple of hours before it lifted and a couple more hours before the sun started making an appearance.  After that it was a nice day.
Today we had a monopoly on rivers and streams. I spent a good part of the day walking alongside both. It actually was pretty relaxing. About mid morning I was crossing a stream and a lady was pulling down her hammock that she had setup right alongside the stream. She said it was nice being able to hear the water as she went to sleep. I’ll have to admit that she did have a good location to spend the night. 
The day ended nicely with a long walk alongside the Laurel Fork River. The trail was gradually going up while the river was gradually going down. There were a lot of rapids and mini falls, but after awhile the trail took me back down to the river at the Laurel Falls. The trail continued to follow the river after the falls, and at one point you actually walk along a ledge that was built out from a rock cliff that the river ran by. It was pretty interesting because you’re right there just about a foot above the river, which is running really strong because of all the rain.
Finally got to the shelter, which is up above the river. There are only me and 2 other guys here and they are sleeping in their tents. There isn’t another spot for a tent so I’m in the shelter. First time I’ve ever had a shelter all to myself.
The reason why is that Hampton TN is only a mile off the trail and the road to it crossed the trail 2 miles back. Most people decided to go into town for the night instead of going on to a shelter.  I’m working the miles so I went on to the shelter.","Mountaineer Shelter

When I got going this morning, the trail took me back down to the river and K walked alongside it for awhile longer. After awhile the trail started to climb and ultimately took me over another ridge. On the other side was a large lake in the distance.  This would be my second time hiking by a TVA made lake, Watauga Lake.
When J got down to the lake it was amazing how much up the water level was. The picnic area the trail went by, all but 2 of the picnic tables were in the water. The 2 that weren’t you could only sit on one side because the water was under the other side. The trail continued around the lake, and at one point I had to cross over 2 logs that were put together to act as a bridge to get across an inlet. The problem was that 2 ducks had decided to take a nap in the middle. I started to walk out figuring they would just jump back in the water, but they weren’t having any of that. They wanted their nap. Every time I stopped to see what they would do they would just go back to napping.  When I got within a few steps of them they just moved further down the logs and settled back into taking a nap.  It wasn’t until I got close to them again that they finally gave it up and reluctantly left the logs for the water.
Once I crossed the dam, the trail went back up and I spent a lot of time hiking along a ridge line. It was nice because the ridge line continued to follow the lake. I was amazed at how many miles the lake stretched along the ridge. I spent several hours going along the lake.
When I got to the next shelter, it was still a little early so I decided to push on a couple of miles to a campsite. When I got here, there were 3 other tents setup. I had just enough time to setup and fix dinner before it got dark. I did notice that there is a full moon tonight so it will be like sleeping with a night light tonight.

Supposedly it would get up to 50 today but it never felt like it. I had to wear my long pants and my windbreaker jacket all day.

At one of the road crossings there was a lady providing some trail magic. She was from Indiana and had dropped off her husband early. He’s doing a section hike of Virginia. They are retired and she’s going to basically follow him and meet him at different locations in VA while he is hiking.
Speaking of it still being cold, it’s supposed to once again get below freezing tonight but supposedly not get so cold again at night for the next several days.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588570,"Ok, today turned out to be a really nice day. Someone finally figured out that we’re almost in May. It was a nice warm day with beautiful blue skies.  An almost perfect hiking day.
Today was a major milestone day. I got up a little early so I could be on the trail by 7am as I wanted to do the 10 miles to Damascus before noon. But, before I would get to Damascus, I would say goodbye to Tennessee and enter Virginia.  Getting into Virginia’s always been a major goal for me. Probably because I have lived in this state for many years and it’s like coming to something familiar.  Plus, I’m also more familiar with the other states after Virginia.
On my way to Damascus I ran into one of the hikers staying at the shelter last night. I had heard about him, but he was already asleep when I got there so I didn’t have a chance to talk to him.  His trail name is Pappy and he’s 83 years old. He hiked the AT the first time when he was 65. He’s intending to finish in early October.  As far as anyone knows, he’s the oldest person on the trail.
I actually was able to get to Damascus by 11:30am so I was able to take my time at Food City (the local grocery store) getting my resupplies for the next 4 days. They also had a deli so I got a sandwich and a salad. I took all my supplies and went to the park and packed my supplies in my backpack and sat in the sun eating my lunch. I looked like a real bag person with everything spread out in front of me on the ground.  After that, I followed the trail through the center of town and noticed an Ice Cream shop on the northern edge of town. Of course I stopped and had some ice cream. It was a nice day and I sat out on their porch and watch the world go by.
With a very full stomach, of course I had to climb back up into the mountains from Damascus.  It took a little while to get back to normal hiking, but it was a good couple of hours spent in town relaxing.
Well, it’s a nice night and someone had already started a fire at the shelter when I got here. There are 7 other hikers here with me and we sat around the fire and talked about out travels so far. What we have liked and not liked. Most said they’re looking forward to warmer nights.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588733,"For the first day of May, today was another perfect hiking day.
When I started out today, I intended to get over Mt Rogers, the highest point in Virginia and the last time I would be at that high an elevation until we got into Vermont.  Unfortunately, after hiking the first 6 miles today, the remaining 12 miles were all uphill, and a significant climb as it was.  I got about 3 miles from the top and was starting to run out of daylight. I had to decide to go on and setup in the dark or take advantage of a nearby campsite. The campsite won out. As it was, a couple of other people also decided to give it up and camped with me.
I was a little disappointed not to have made it to the shelter at the top of Mt Rodgers as that’s where a lot of the wild ponies usually hang around. Everywhere else we worry about Bears, on Mt Rodgers you worry about the wild ponies that come around looking for snacks.  Tomorrow morning when I go by the shelter I’ll see if any of the ponies are hanging around.
Since service has been so spotty, usually I just type up the days events before I go to bed and then post them on the website when I get a signal during the day. That doesn’t leave me with much time to checkout the comments, so I thought I would address one this time.
Hey Robb, thanks for the questions about my hammock.  The hammock is more comfortable then the ground, but I have a good insulating air pad that makes the ground pretty soft. My hammock is an ENO Sub Sonic. Since I have sent my hammock home and have been using my tent, I have used the shelters several times. For example, in the Smokies you were required to use the shelters unless they were full. Of the 5 nights I was in the Smokies I only stayed in my tent once.  Since then, there have been some other times that I used the shelter, usually when the weather was predicting a cold rain over night.  Because I had my tent, I also had a  blowup air mattress, which made it comfortable to sleep in the shelters.  I’ve been in a shelter a couple of times with another guy using a hammock with an under quilt like I did. When he slept in the shelter he had to sleep on the floor without the benefit of an air mattress.","Saunders Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588840,"Ok, I’m beginning to like Virginia. Today’s weather was even better then yesterday. Tonight it’s only supposed to get down into the low 50’s. Kind of a problem when your sleeping bag is rated for 15 degrees. Now that I’ve crossed Mt Rodgers, it might be time to think about swapping out the winter gear.
Well, today was an interesting day of some good points and not so good ones. From the campsite I stayed at, I only had a short hike to get to the top of Mt Rodgers. Unfortunately the  going down was a real pain. Think about a narrow stream that is really really rocky, take out the water, and put it on a sharp angle and that was the trail coming down from Mt Rodgers.  The problem is that it was like that for about 4 miles.
The fun thing was that there were a lot of the wild ponies along the way. The area around Mt Rodgers and it’s smaller summits is both a National Forest and a State Park. They brought in the ponies to help maintain the grassy sections of the mountain park areas.
The first group I ran into (see picture) had 2 very little newborns.  The second group of 3 ponies was a different story. One of those ponies took an interest in seeing what was in my backpack. I kept having to turn around to get him to stop. Eventually he got bored and wandered off.
Another highlight of the day was that I crossed the 500 miles mark. I had planned on doing that yesterday but having to stop before the shelter kept me from doing it.Speaking of it being a small world, there is a hiker (Moonbeam) here at the shelter that is also from Jacksonville.  First other Jacksonville person I’ve meet on the trail.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589018,"After 2 days of difficult hiking up and then down Mt Rodgers, today felt like a walk in the park. Alright , so a park that still has some decent up and down climbs, but at least the trail was normal and not rock covered.  A much easier day. Didn’t finish the day today feeling beat. 
After spending yesterday dealing with wild ponies, I knew it would be hard to beat that. However, today gave another opportunity to mingle with the wild animals.  I came out of the woods and went through a gate into a really nice grassy pasture. To my surprise, I came over a hill and smack into a herd of wild cows (ok, so the cows weren’t really on the wild side). Actually, they just stood there and watched me walk by. Much better behaved then the ponies yesterday.
The shelter tonight is really interesting. First it is at the visitor center for the Washington & Jefferson National Forests.  It’s also close to Marion, VA and several people that had gotten here before me had taken a shuttle into Marion and bought food to cook on the fire (it has a really nice one). One of the guys is a chef so he cooked steaks, potatoes, asparagus and garlic bread.  They also got stuff to make samores for desert.Another benefit of this shelter is because it’s right off the Visitors Center you can get food delivered to the Center’s parking lot, so several of us went together and had some pizzas delivered  great trail food tonight.There also are several folks that I had been hiking with but got ahead of me when I zeroed in Boone, so it was nice to get caught up with everyone.","Hurricane Mountain Shelter

There I was being picked up by Jim Sparks and his wife who is a shuttle driver out of Marion VA. Jim normally will shuttle hikers between the Partnership Shelter and Marion, but he was willing to pick me up Inn Atkins and take me to Wytheville where I was going to meet Faye. They are a lovely couple and on the way we stopped at an Amish store that they like to get produce from. I did get some Molasses cookies which were great.  When we got to Wytheville, we drove through the town and they showed me the highlights and made recommendations for things to do and places to eat and then dropped me off at my hotel.Faye, and our other daughter Ashley, showed up around 6pm. Once they got settled we went into town and had dinner at Graze on Main. It was a nice restaurant but the service was a little slow.

In packing up this morning, I swapped out my  15 degree winter sleeping bag for my 50 degree summer sleeping bag.  Plus, I was going to leave all my cold weather clothes but decided to keep my long pants and fleece for a couple more weeks just to be safe.  The rest of my warm weather clothes I swapped out and packed an extra short sleeve running shirt.  After getting the car loaded, we headed out but not without stopping at Bob Evans for breakfast first. It would be nice to get back on the trail with a full breakfast under my belt.
It was 11 am by the time we got to the drop off spot and said our goodbyes and I officially got back on the trail.  It’s always hard to say goodbye, but it is also nice to get back on the trail.
The weather forecast had called for rain midday and that’s exactly what happened. It rained pretty decently for about an hour and then around 6pm the sky cleared up to just partly cloudy. We’ll have to see if the rain forecast for tomorrow comes true or not.
When I got to the shelter tonight I was expecting a lot of people, but there were only 3 other hikers.  I was worried that I would be in another hiker bubble but it seems that a lot of hikers bailed at a hostel early today because of the rain this afternoon.  I’m ok with that as it makes it easier on the trail and finding space to setup at the shelters.
Another big milestone today. Just a couple of miles into my hike I hit the quarter way point (547 miles).  Only three quarters left. Imagine, I’m 45 days into it and only a quarter done. That’s why they tell you not to focus on the total journey, but instead smaller bit size pieces. For me that was getting to NC, getting thru the Smokies, meeting Kelly, getting to Damascus and then meeting Faye.  My next short term goals are seeing Ashley’s good friend Nash @ mile 822, then hiking with Chris for a couple of days near Front Royal and finally getting to Harpers Ferry.","I-81 underpass, Atkins VA

Nothing exciting in the morning, a normal hike with the normal ups and downs. Made it to Chestnut Knob Shelter without any issues although there was a 4 mile climb getting to the shelter. We climbed the equivalent of 2 Empire State Buildings to get to that shelter.  Chestnut Knob is a cool shelter in that it’s one of only a few that has a door instead of an open wall. That’s because it is an old fire warden’s cabin that was converted into a shelter. I was only intending to stop and have lunch and then proceed on another 10 miles to Jenkins Shelter.  3 other hikers got there right around me so we all ate lunch. There is a really neat view from there of a farming valley that is ringed by narrow mountain ranges (see the picture). By the time we left to get back on the trail the sky had gotten a little darker but still had some sunlight peaking through.  After a couple of miles, we all were stopped to get water (no water at Chestnut) when we heard some thunder off in the distance but ahead of us. Since the clouds were heading that way, we figured the storm was in front of us. Unfortunately things seemed to get bunched up and it wasn’t long for the thunder to be closer to us. At this point everyone dashed to try to make the next Shelter as quickly as possible. About another 30 minutes later and the sky opened up and it began to ran really heavily plus thunder was now all around us.  To add insult to injury, it also began hailing. Luckily the hail was small so it didn’t hurt. The other good thing about it was that it didn’t get windy. It could have been because the trail was about 40 feet down the side from the top on the opposite side from the direction the storm was coming.  The storm lasted for about 3 hours and then quit.  It took me another hour and a half to finish getting to the shelter so at least I had dried off by the time I got here.
Because of the storm there were a lot of people that had stopped at Jenkins during the day and didn’t go on so there were a lot of people here. That turned out to be a good thing because several people that I had been hiking with before I took my zero were here, to include Moonbeam, my fellow Jaxsonite.  It was nice catching up on what we all had been doing the last couple of days.","Knob Maul Shelter

Once I got everything packed up and was in the trail, after about 4 miles I ran into 2 guys from the local AT hiking club. They are the ones that maintain this section of the trail. They had just finished posting a sign saying that the trail was closed ahead and being rerouted due to some fallen trees at the bridge that were being removed. They asked me to to read the sign and make sure it was clear. While I was doing that Hiccups (she was one of the 4 of us that got caught in the storm yesterday) came up and they asked her the same thing. We both agreed that it was clear so they asked us to continue on the original trail so that we could tell the crew working on the trees that the trail was closed after us and they could begin.  Doug was the foreman of the group and he lead us down the rest of the way and through the trees to get over the bridge. (In the picture, Doug is the guy going across the bridge. Hiccups is in front of me.)  Doug explained that the trees had fallen recently and the hiking club had contacted the Forest Services who then sent Doug and his team. He said they were part lumberjacks and part tree service.  They needed to remove the trees but not let them begin to slide down the hillside and damage the bridge.  He definitely had his hands full.
Once we got past that, the local hiking club had setup some trail magic as a way of compensating the hikers because of the reroute. It was a really good trail magic because they had chocolate milk. They also had lots of fruit, sandwich fixings, snacks and a bunch of home made cookies.  I had 2 bananas, some chocolate milk and took some cookies for later.
Later in the morning I came upon the area of the forest fire that they had just within the past week (I put a picture of it in my photo album). It was still so fresh that you could still smell and taste the soot and smoke. 
About 2pm the trail dumped into a road that would take us across I-77. Right we’re we came out, there was a store/deli called Brushy Mountain Outpost. A great place for lunch. When I went in, Moonbeam and Hiccups were already there so I ordered a couple of hotdogs (much better then Skeeters in Wytheville) and sat with the 2 of them. While we were eating we learn that Hiccups was from Saint Augustine and had just graduated from Flagler College in December.  To make it even more interesting, another hiker (Ink) came in that Hiccups knew. She was from Springfield, IL (coverage for the large group of friends back home that are from Springfield).  Moonbeam and Hiccups are going back to Damascus for the trail day festival on May 18-20. Moonbeam is being picked up by her parents next week and Hiccups by some friends so while we finished up, they picked out a place that would be convenient to be picked up at. That would mean that they wouldn’t be doing very many miles a day for the next week. Since I’m not going back to Damascus and will be pushing on trying to maximize my miles, we figured that we would be parting ways so we said our goodbyes as they stopped at the shelter that was only 2 more miles down trail while I was going on to the one after that which was still another 11 miles away.
I got to the shelter just as it was starting to turn dark. I was able to setup my tent in the dusk, but I fixed my dinner in the dark.

The couple of thing worth mentioning are the 2 creeks I crossed. Kimberling Creek with its suspension bridge and Dismal Creek which had a nice waterfall. The suspension bridge was cool because it definitely moved while you were crossing it and the creek below was pretty neat given all the rain we have had.
The shelter I’m staying at tonight is pretty cool in that it has a large patio off the front with large bench seats. It’s like sitting on a deck at home instead of just having a picnic table.

When I got up this morning I had 8 miles to doto get  to Pearisburg where I would resupply.  The hiking itself was pretty boring because pretty much the entire 8 miles was in tunnels of  Rhododendrons. You couldn’t see anything but at least I had shade.
From Pearisburg on it was more interesting.  First I stopped at Food Lion and bought my supplies for the next 4 days. I also bought a small bottle of chocolate milk (good for anything that ails you) and orange juice to drink while I packed my food bag. After that I went to DQ (Dairy Queen for those non-US readers) for lunch. When I was done I started walking back to the trail head (about a mile away) when a lady asked me if I wanted a lift. Turned out that she runs one of the Hostels in town and was going to pick up some hikers. After I got back on the trail and was crossing the bridge over the New River that I noticed the sky was getting really dark and then there was thunder. I put in my raincoat and just as I got to the end of the bridge and started down the stairs to the road below the sky really opened up and it had a driving wind. As luck would have it, the road at the bottom of the stairs went underneath the bridge so I stopped there and waited. After 30 minutes the storm quit and the sun started coming back out again so I continued on the trail. 
After about 5 miles I came to a road crossing and there were 2 Forest Service Rangers in separate trucks. It seemed odd to see them there but not my job to question them. It wasn’t easily marked for where I was to go next and they obviously saw my confusion and one of them got out of his truck and walked over to me. He showed me where the trail went down a gravel road for a little bit and then turned back into the woods. I couldn’t help but ask if something was up since they both seemed to be parked there for awhile. He said that there was a pipeline going in near by and they were there to keep an eye on the protesters.  I asked if there was anything I needed to be concerned about around the trail and he said no, the protesters weren’t camped near the trail.  The rest of the hike to the shelter was uneventful.
As a side note. After leaving Pearisburg the trail turned west until we got to the last mountain ridge that goes up the Virginia/West Virginia state lines. We have a really gorgeous view down into the valley on the West Virginia side.  The trail will continue on the boarders for another 10 miles before turning back east to eventually cross I-81 just north of Roanoke, where we will stay for the rest of Virginia.","Doc’s Knob Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590031,"Today started out really nice with a really cool view of the valley below. You can’t really see it because of the fog, but there are a lot of farm houses down in that valley. In fact, that is how it has been for the last several days.
To give you an idea, take a piece of paper and put you hands on each end. Slip your hands towards each other so that the paper starts folding up in the middle. Keep moving you hands together until there is only 3-4 inches between them and then crease the top of the fold. That’s the kind of mountains we are hiking on now, long and thin. We always hike along the very top so when there aren’t any trees, you can see down into the valleys on both sides.
The thing that is cool about it is as I’m walking, I can hear the cows, the dogs and other farm animals, the tractors, people cutting their lawn and even kids yelling at each other.  It’s like walking down a country lane and although you can’t see the farm houses, you can hear all the farm noises.  That’s the way it’s been for the last several days. Being in the wilds but surrounded by all the noises of other people.
Today was a long day in that I hiked my first 25 mile day. It wasn’t that the trail was super easy, it was just that I wanted to make up for the short day yesterday.  As it was, I didn’t get into the shelter area until 9:30pm which was an hour after the sun set. This made it my second time where I night hiked. Which is walking by the light of your headlight. I got to the shelter without any difficulties, but as is the practice, everyone was already asleep.

After a couple of miles we can across 3 other hikers (3 friends, all nurses- they were pretty well know on the trail because well they are nurses) that were just leaving the campsite they had stopped at. The 5 of us played leap frog for most of the morning, and as luck would have it, at this particular time I was in the lead of the group.  As I came over a small raise, there was a bear about 50-60 feet in front of me s scratching himself on a tree next to the trail. No sooner had I stopped and said whoa, then he turned and saw me also. Before I had a chance to even think about getting out my camera he bolted thru the woods and over the ridge. So now I can say I’ve actually seen a Bear. 
About midday, we were walking through some pastures and this time the nurses were in the lead. When I got up to the road where the trail crossed, I noticed the ladies talking to a couple in a van in the parking lot. When they saw me they flagged me over. Seems that the couple were locals that were friends of another couple and he was hiking the trail. His wife had told him where he had stopped last night and they calculated about what time he would cross the road. Initially they were asking us if we knew Butch. Then it came out were he had camped and it was the same place the ladies had camped. Eventually we figured out that his trail name was Timeless. The ladies said that he had left 2 hours before them so he would have already gone by that point.  At this point they got out of the car and handed us a bunch of bags of food that they were going to give him and said that we might as well have his lunch. She also told us a sorry about at home his nickname is Buttercup because his wife is always telling him to suck it up Buttercup. We got a good laugh out of that and said we should change his trail name to that.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590425,"Today my intent was to make it to Four Pines Hostel where Faye had sent a food box for me. That meant that I would need to climb up and then down to mountain ridges.  I also wanted to get there before 5pm because I wanted to eat at a nearby restaurant called The Homeplace. It’s one of the highest rated restaurants by thru hikers. It’s also a popular restaurant for Blacksburg which is nearby. They serve family style and it’s an all-you-can-eat restaurant.  Because of that I got up at 4:30 so that I could be in the trail at 5:30am. That meant that I hiked in the dark using my headlight for about 45 minutes. I gave myself the extra time because you never know what the terrain will be in the ridge. Often it has been very rocky and you can’t get any speed. Plus, each or the ridges required a 1,500 feet uphill hike and after 6 miles of walking along the ridge, another 1,500 feet decline back to a road in the lower valley just to do it all over again. As it turned out, the first ridge turned out to have good switch backs so the trail wasn’t super steep and the ridge wasn’t very rocky so I was able to knock it out easily. 
When I got down to the road crossing there was a couple that was doing trail magic. I had my favorite breakfast (pancakes) and an orange before heading back on the trail. At this point it’s 10am and I only have 8 more miles to go. Piece of cake you would say, but then I didn’t know what I was getting into yet. The next ridge was called Dragons Tooth and I had heard it would be difficult but not how difficult. It was a 5 mile uphill climb going up 1,500 feet. Unfortunately after the first 2 miles the next 3 miles were all through and over rocks. Plus the heat had really cranked up and there was no water sources after the first mile, that meant I had to make my water last for 7 miles. The real pain can when I finally got to Dragons Tooth and started down, it became a total rock scramble. There were times when I had to slide down rocks to get to the next ledge. There were places where they had bolted hand holds into the rocks because the rocks were smooth and to tall to step up.  Of the last 3 miles, the first mile was like that. The next 1.5 miles were similar but the rocks were more dispersed and not continuous.  It was bad enough that on the uphill side the Forest Service had posted a sign warning of the extreme grade and rockiness. That was the first time I had seen anything like that warning. The other issue was that it was a really warm day and I had about run out of water. In the end it took me 3 hours to finish that last 3 miles and it was 4pm when I came to the road. I was definitely overheated and exhausted. Luckily the owner of the hostel drove by and picked me up. When I got the the hostel I took a cold shower and felt much better. After that, myself and 2 othe hikers that had come in right behind me got a ride to The Homeplace for dinner. We waited an hour and 40 minutes before they seated us by it was totally worth it. Besides eating a lot of food, we killed 2 pitchers each of sweet tea and lemonade. We all three agreed that the Dragons Tooth was the most difficult hike we had done so far and that we all were probably on the verge of heat exhaustion.

I offered to take their picture if they would do the same for me. While we were standing there the father asked me if I was hiking the AT. When I said yes they all started asking me a bunch of questions about my experience so far. They were a nice family who are from Wisconsin. When I told them I was originally from Michigan, the parents said they were also but from Detroit. He has a brother that lives in Kalamazoo.

There were 2 nurses staying at the shelter last night and I happened to mention that I didn’t think I was getting enough electrolytes and both said that I should drink a half liter of water treated with Nuun (they gave me one to try) that way my body would reset my levels overnight. I’m still adding the Propel to the water I drink during the day.
Next I went to Kroger’s and bought another container of melon pieces and a couple of fruit smoothies.  While I was seating at a bench by the store, an employee came out for a smoke break and asked me if I was hiking the AT. When I said yes he asked if I had heard about the bad weather heading our way. I hadn’t so I was all ears. He said a severe thunderstorm was coming in about 20-30 minutes with rain a hail and that the rest of the week was supposed to be stormy also. After he mentioned this, I noticed that the sky was really turning dark, so I figured that I should get a little closer to the trail. I just made it to the Exxon station that was next to where the trail went back into the woods when the sky opened up. The guy working the counter was pretty cool and let me hangout during the storm. Plus, the guy smokes pork butts and sells BBQ sandwiches in the store, so I bought a couple sandwiches and a drink and he showed me where there was a stool I could use by the storage room. It was kind of cool sitting there waited out the worst of the storm, eating BBQ (it was good BBQ) and looked out on the parking lot.  When The storm had dropped to just a heavy drizzle I thanked him for his hospitality and headed back on the trail.
Because of the storm I didn’t get back on the trail until 4pm with another 10 miles to go to the next shelter. It got dark at @ 8:30pm so I had to do some night hiking using my headlight again. I only had to do that for about an hour and at least it didn’t rain.  Since I kind of ate a lot in Daleville I skipped fixing dinner since everyone at the shelter was already asleep. Instead I’ll fix it for breakfast instead. Besides I can use the extra calories.
Forgot to mention that I hit another major milestone today. Coming out of Daleville I completed 730 miles which is one third of the way to Maine.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590735,"Well, today was definitely a marathon day hiking wise. I had talked to so southbound hikers and some locals the past couple of days and they had said that if I wanted to get some long miles in this would be the best opportunity before getting into the Shenandoah's or Northern VA because this is where we start to parallel the Blue Ridge Parkway. For the first 15 to 20 miles we stay pretty close to the parkway so the trail is pretty good walking wise. After today we still will cross the parkway on and off but the trail doesn’t stay very close in between those points.
It was good enough that I was able to get some good miles in even though we had a couple of good soaking rains during the day. Luckily for me it had stopped raining before I got to the shelter so I could get settled in. I’m staying in the shelter tonight because it’s supposed to rain all night and over the next few days. In fact, as I’m writing this it is absolutely pouring out.  All the more reason to get settled in my sleeping bag and say good night.","Wilson Creek Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590879,"As I mentioned yesterday, it pretty much poured rain all night long. When we all got up around 6:30am it looked like it was going to continue that way for the rest of the day. As it was, at 7am it was like someone shut off the water and there even was some blue sky peaking out.  It actually stayed that for most of the day until it opened up again around 5pm. At least we got some dry hiking in.
After doing that really long day yesterday I cut back a little today. Mainly because my feet needed the break. After hiking in the rail all day I definitely had a serious case of prune feet. Plus, after a few miles of hiking this morning I started to get some pain in both heels.  Shortly after that I came to a shelter and took off my boots to check my feet. Since my boots were still soaking wet I still had some pruned feet again. What I did notice was that the pain seemed to be coming from a kind of rash developing on both heels. I liberally costed them with Gold Bond powder and changed out my socks. The rest of the day was pretty uneventful until it started raining again and everything got soaked again. This time when I got to the shelter For the night I checked them again and the rash was a little more angry, so I put some Neosporin on them and are letting them air out.  I’ll put on a fresh pair of socks in the morning before I set out.
The interesting thing about today’s hike was that we crossed the James River. To cross the river you use this really long pedestrian bridge. It is the longest bridge that we use on the AT. 
Well, time to settle in for the night. A lot of hikers are heading back to Damascus for the Hiker Days Festival this weekend. I suspect that I’ll have less company in the shelter areas the next couple of days.
Post Script:  Before you all panic on my behalf, the Neosporin and gold bold powder seems to have done the trick. When I checked my feet this morning they seem more normal and don’t hurt. I put some more Neosporin on them and taped them to prevent rubbing, plus put a bunch of gold Bold powder in my boots. I also put on my last pair of dry socks so I should be good for another day. I’ll check them again midday.","

Tomorrow I head down Priest Mt and meet up with Lindsey and David Hill (Ashley’s friends). I was just planning on taking Sunday off but after checking my feet I may take Monday off also.

The hike down Priest Mountain was kind of interesting in that the trail crossed several decent size streams (we’re talking 8-10 feet across) that you had to hop across on rocks.  In the past, streams of that size would have had a bridge.  They normally are not anything of an issue, but given all the heavy rain last night these streams had a lot of water flowing down them. Not a situation where you wanted to make a mistake.
I made it safely down and was picked up by Lindsey and David Hill (David is the Sheriff for Nelson County). They are a great couple and I really appreciate them going out of their way for me. They feed me and Lindsey even did my laundry while I was getting cleaned up. We all agreed that my feet looked pretty gross.
So, speaking of that, I’m going to put things on hold for a few days and let my feet heal. When they are ready I’ll pickup where I left off. Sorry to leave you hanging but no sense in continuing to make journal entries until I’m back on the trail.

As much as I want to hike the AT, I also really want to enjoy retirement after the trail. Not trying to be dramatic, but besides being a physical challenge, it is also a very potentially dangerous environment. It’s not a matter of will you get hurt, but when and hopefully not badly. There have been some things that have happened on the trail that I haven’t put in the journal to keep the worrying down on the home front, but let’s just say they caused minor injuries when they could have easly been much more sever. 
As much as I’ve enjoyed my time on the trail, I had to decide was it worth completing it at potentially any cost. I decided there were other things as important to me thhart I wanted to do in retirement that I wasn’t willing to jeopardize at the expense of completing the trail. Plus, after 833 miles, I definitely can say I have an appreciation for hiking the trail and I can always make plans to come back and finish it in sections.
I appreciate everyone’s support and comments while I was hiking. It definitely helped and it was nice to know there were so many people keeping track of my adventure.","

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594271,"Well, surprise surprise, I’m heading back on the trail for three weeks starting June 18.
Basically, this is what has been going on. The bottom line is that I have arthritis in my left hip and knee. To be honest, I knew that going into this but thought that it was manageable. After all I’m only walking. So, both started grumbling after 6 weeks on the trail, but of course I just assumed that a little nursing and everything would be fine. Of course, over the last two weeks they really started to complain and I became worried about my knee pulling a full out revolt and giving out at the most inappropriate time and on the trail that can be a big deal. On top of that, I had already fallen and hit my head on a rock. Luckily I was able to ensure that the rock made a full recovery, but given that my knee wasn’t playing nice, the next time could be really ugly for the rock.
What all that means is that I recognize that I’m not the best candidate for 5 to 6 months of non-stop hiking. Instead, I’ll hike the remaining part of the trail in smaller pieces.  This 3 week segment will get me past the halfway point so that all I need to do is to breakup the second half of the trail into sections more accommodating to my knee and hip.","

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594631,"Ok, I’ve got to start out with a disclaimer. I didn’t really hike 50.5 miles today. I decided that it would be much easier for Faye to drop me off at the entrance to the Shenandoah National Park since it was right off of I-64 instead of having her drive a bunch a back roads to get me to where I left off. That means that I skipped ahead 30 miles. Since I’m not trying to finish the trail in one go anymore, I thought it was a party foul I could live with.  I had to enter the 50.5 miles so that the total miles in the trail journal website will match where I really am. From now on the miles will reflect actual miles that I’ve hiked for that day.
So, first day back in the trail. I have to admit it felt pretty good. Being well rested made the trail going pretty painless. Having said that, I can tell that I’ve been off the trail long enough to have lost some of my trail legs. I got winded on some long uphill climbs a lot sooner then before. Plus, when I got to the hut (in the Shenandoah National Park the shelters are called huts) it really felt good to stop for the day.
One thing that was cool was that I ran into an older lady with a young boy. As is typically on the trail, we stopped and chatted for a few minutes. She looked really familiar (no disrespect, but she doesn’t have any hair so she someone that kind of stands out). It turned out that she worked at the Top of Georgia Hostel that I stayed at near the end of my first week on the trail.  She had taken a couple of weeks off and was hiking with her grandson.
The other interesting thing that happened today was that I figured that I was going to get baptized again in an afternoon thundershower. The sky turned dark gray, lots of thunder and wind, and I could even smell the rain in the air so I knew it was close. It stayed that way but the rain never came. After awhile the sun came back out and the storm moved on. After hiking for a couple more miles, I came to place on the trail where there was almost a straight line between the wet ground and the dry side. Seems the storm missed me by 2 miles.
Tomorrow I should get to the first of the campgrounds in the park. Everyone is looking forward to it because they have a store and a restaurant/grill. It won’t be as spectacular for me since it’s only my second day back, but it will still be fun.
Well, time to see how the sleeping will be and if it will be as restful as it used to be.","Route 250 - SNP entrance

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594746,"Today was a pretty fun day. I got up around 5:45 (it gets light a lot earlier now then it did before) and was on the trail by 7am.  The first stop was the Loft Mountain Campground, which is the first campground in the park. It’s really nice with a store, restaurant, laundromat and even showers ($1.75 for 5 minutes). There were about a dozen hikers hanging out doing laundry, taking showers and eating stuff from the store.  I stopped and bought a chocolate milkshake and a sandwich. I also bought another instant meal from dinner since I’ll be out another night before I’ll get to my food drop.
Today I only did 13 miles and stopped at 3pm because I wanted to give my legs a break. It turned out to be a wise decision because about an hour later an afternoon storm came and it poured for about an hour and a half.
After the storm quit, an English couple in their late 60’s showed up. They are spending a week hiking the park with a friend of theirs from Baltimore. It’s been nice talking to them. Interestingly enough, in an earlier trip they actually had spent a week staying in a condo in Atlantic Beach. We compared notes from my travels in England and their trips to the States.
Regarding last nights sleep, it took me a long time to finally fall asleep. I’m hoping tonight I can get to sleep earlier.","Blackrock Hut

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594876,"Ok, I’ll have to admit that Dave was pretty much on target when he called this stretch the Super Highway. There still are 1,000+ feet of ups and downs but they aren’t steep and the trail is a lot more friendly here then in the past. What I mean is less rocks or roots to trip you up. Even with haven taken 4 weeks off and losing some of my trail legs I’m still able to put in decent days. Now the only issue is that the distances between the huts is kind of screwy. They are either too close together or really far apart.  Today was one of those where the huts were a good distance from each other. Tomorrow I have to decide if I want to do a short day or a 20+ mile day.  The good part is that I’ll go through another campground with a store and a restaurant so I’ll get a decent lunch either way.
Today’s weather forecast was for thunderstorms from  2 to 8 pm. So far I’ve been able to dodge the first 2 days of afternoon thunderstorms and luckily I did it again today. The first 2 storms went through in front of me. The second one was close enough that I got some misty rain for a few minutes, enough for me to breakout my rain jacket, but nothing more. Before the next storm hit, I was able to get to the Lewis Mountain Campground store and wait it out on the porch while I enjoyed some afternoon snacks. I only had a mile from the store to the hut I was staying at, and I was able to get to the hut in between storms. As I’m writing this, it seems that the last storm might have finished for the night.
There is a group of 8 teenagers and some of their parents staying with us here at the hut. Some are in tents and some are staying in the hut. Then are spending the week traveling the Park from north to south.  I’m here with 2 other thru hikers and they have been asking us all kinds of questions about the trail. After that they started giving each other trail names. That was pretty comical. When another storm started threatening to come through everyone decided to call it quits and turn in.
Speaking of turning in, last night I fell asleep at 9pm and slept until 6am. Seems like it didn’t take long to get back to sleeping on the trail.

This morning I was on the trail by 6:30am as I had several stops to make today. The first one was at the Big Meadows Campground restaurant. I got there at 9:30 still in time for breakfast. Even though I had already had my pop tarts and peanut butter taco at the hut before I left, I had no problem doing justice to 3 buckwheat pancakes and sausages. After that, I continued on and got to the Skyland Resort around 2pm.  Of course they have a restaurant so I stopped and had a turkey sandwich for lunch.  As you can see from the picture, I had some help eating my sandwich. None of that stopped me from still having my stove top stuffing and chicken for dinner. I have been kind of surprised as to how quickly my hiker hunger came back.
Lots of hikers have seen Bears but I haven’t yet. The best I’ve seen is a Doe with and really small fawn. They were standing a little off the trail and the fawn was standing under it’s mother watching me walk by.
Today was another day with afternoon storms. I lucked out again and just got drizzled on before I got to the Hut for the night. I got here at 6pm and was surprised to see that I was the only one here. After about an hour with it raining pretty hard, 3 other hikers showed up, so there are 4 of us here tonight. That’s a bit odd because it seems that I was back in a hiker bubble with the huts being full and with several tents & hammocks around them.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595068,"Well, last night was probably the most interesting night I have had on the trail so far, at least from a wild life encounter that is.
As I had said yesterday, it started raining after I got to the hut and it continued to rain all night. In fact it continued to rain throughout the day today. The first full day of rain since being back on the trail.
There were 4 of us sleeping in the hut and around midnight we all got woken by a bunch of large snorting coming from in front of the hut. One of the guys said I think we have a bear so I turned on my headlamp to try to scare it away. Instead of a bear there was a large buck standing about 5 feet in front of the shelter eating the grass there. We all stared at each other for awhile and then the deer went back to eating the grass. We figured that if there was a deer nearby then no bears were close so we all went back to sleep.
The other encounter was a little smaller. Someone else had forgotten to put away their tool of toilet paper and the mice had gotten into it. They like to use it as nesting material. It looked like it had snowed in the hut. There were bits of toilet paper everywhere.
Regarding the rain. Since this was my first day of hiking all day in the rain I was keeping a close eye on my feet. I’m happy to report that I didn’t have any issues with them. Part of it could also be that I changed out my socks for a different kind. The ones I have now have an inner lining that pulls the water away from your feet. It’s kind of a silky material so it also cuts down on the abrasion directly on my toes from the outer material.
We’re all hoping that the weather forecast is correct and the rain stops tonight followed by several days of nice weather.","Byrd’s Nest 3 Hut

Mountain Home is owned by Scott and Lisa Jenkins who are in the process of renovating the house (built in 1847) into a Bed and Breakfast. Scott hiked the AT back in 2012 and he puts up hikers in the rooms he has finished while they work on the house.
After I got here I showered, changed into clean clothes, gave Scott my dirty ones to get washed, and pulled out my sleeping bag and rain cover to air out. After that Scott gave me a ride into Front Royal. The interesting thing is that after living in Northern Virginia for many years I had never gotten out to Front Royal. It’s a nice little town and after walking around Main Street I decided to have dinner at the Mill which is an old grain mill converted into a restaurant. I liked the historical aspect of it and the food was really good.  After that Lisa came to pick me up and brought me back to the Mountain Home.

Getting back on the trail soon became a pain. After putting on dry socks and shoes, it took all of an hour or so before your shoes and socks were soaked again. There has been so much rain in the area that sections of the trail are completely flooded and some of the streams are so high that the stones that you would use to walk over on are all under water.  We had some more afternoon storms today that didn’t help matters at all.  Looks like even if we don’t get anymore rain it will still be a problem of keeping your shoes and socks dry.

There aren’t many switch backs, pretty much straight up and the straight down. The first have wasn’t that bad because the trail was still pretty decent. The second half was almost completely covered in rocks. It took me 12.5 hours to complete the hike today because of the roller coaster.

For example, there is a Campground right off the trail that is dedicated to backpackers and run by the state. Besides tent sites and picnic tables, it has restrooms, showers, and a deep sink to fill bottles.  Everything that a hiker needs. It’s at about the halfway point in the state.
The other thing is that the trail seems to be pretty close to the path that the Confederate Army used on their drive to Gettysburg. You are always popping out of the woods into a civil war battle field. 
I also stopped at the original Washington Monument that was built by the people of Boonesboro in 1827. Long before the monument in DC was built. It’s got a spiral staircase that will take you to the top where you have a great view into Maryland, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

It was a short distance to Pine Grove Furnace State Park were my daughter Ashley was going to pick me up.  I got there a little before the store opened where you can take the half gallon ice cream challenge. By the time the store had opened there were about 6 of us waiting to take the challenge. The challenge is to eat a half gallon in less then a half hour. I had been craving chocolate chip mint ice cream, but unfortunately they didn’t have any so I settled on strawberry ice cream. I’ll have to say that none of us finished in less then a half hour.  The day looked like it was going to be a hot one, so I’m sure the heat would help others beat the challenge later on.
The only downside to the morning was that when I got to the store I took off my shoes, put them by my backpack and put on my flip-flops  While I was waiting for Ashley to show up, I moved my backpack away from the table I was sitting at to make room for more hikers that were showing up.  Unfortunately I forgot to also move my shoes, so when Ashley got there I grabbed my back and we headed out. It wasn’t until he got to her house and I pulled my backpack out of the car that I figured out that I had left my hiking shoes.  I figure it was a pretty good mystery to the other hikers that came to the store that day and saw a pair of hiking shoes under one of the picnic tables.

In case they don’t, I’ve got my trusty backups to use.
I have decided to start out with my 15 degree sleeping bag instead of my 50 degree bag because the nights are still getting down into the 30s and 40s.
Happy trails everyone. Keep an eye out for further updates from the trail.","Pine Grove Furnace Store

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610537,"Last night I spent the last night at the hostel at the Ironmaster Mansion in Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  This way I could get an early start in the morning. When my wife dropped me off, we stopped at the General Store to see if my hiking shoes where still around but no luck. Hopefully someone else got some use out of them.
The only other person staying at the hostel with me was Dave, who is a thru hiker that started a week ago at Harpers Ferry, WV. He is going to do a flip/flop which means when he gets to Maine, he will go back to Harpers Ferry and go south to Georgia.
My plan today was to go 15 miles to Alec Kennedy Shelter. That was probably an ambitious target, but the closer shelter was only 7 miles away.  I’m glad I didn’t do that because it only took me 3.5 hours to hike the first 8 miles.  At that point there was a general store and deli just a tenth of a mile down the street. It turned out to be a great place to have lunch.  Since it has been really windy and cool, it was also a nice place to warmup for awhile. 
Unfortunately the next 7 miles weren’t as easy as the first 8. There is a pattern like that on the trail. The trail got rocky and then I hit a section called the maze. For about a mile you are hiking over, around and through a large bolder field. There was even a section similar to the “Fatman Squeeze” in Virginia where you have to squeeze between 2 towering rock formations.  After that it wasn’t too bad.
I got to the shelter and found that I was sharing it with a small Boy Scout Troop from NY.  They are spending the week hiking through the western half of the AT in Pennsylvania.
Well, all in all it’s been a really good first day on the trail. I fell pretty good and I didn’t have any issues with my shoes. I think they will workout well.
I am glad I brought my cold weather sleeping bag since it is supposed to get down in the lower 40’s tonight.  I’m pretty snug and ready to call it a night.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park
",Alec Kennedy Shelter,"Apr 15, Mon",15.30
Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610626,"Today was an excellent day for day 2.  The wind stopped during the night, so it was calm and mostly blue skies when I woke up around 6:15.  The scouts started moving around while I was putting my stuff away. After eating my breakfast of Pop Tarts, I bid them a goodbye and headed down to Boiling Springs where I had my second breakfast of the day. I went to Cafe 101 and ordered eggs, sausage and French toast with 2 glasses of chocolate milk, because everyone knows that chocolate milk is a miracle drink.  The breakfast was really good. I would highly recommend them to anyone who will be in the area.
There was an older gentleman seating at a table next to mine that struck up a conversation with me. Turns out he was retired Army and I told him I was retired Navy. After he said he wouldn’t hold it against me, he said that he knew we hikers were always looking for a way to charge our phones, so as one vet to another, he told me about a hidden outlet on the Veterans Memorial Tower that was across the street.  I thanked him for that intelligence and after finishing my breakfast I went across the street and plugged in my phone to let it recharge.
The Tower was on the edge of a small lake and there was a bench right by the outlet so I dropped my stuff and made myself comfortable. After a little while, a duck wandered over and checked out my backpack. Turns out he is Donald Duck’s cousin Mortimer. He had just come back from spending the winter in Florida.  Seems my backpack wasn’t that interesting to him because he decided to instead eat the grass around it. After awhile he went back to see what his pals were doing on the lake.
I decided that I should get going because I still had 15 miles to get to the shelter. As it turned out, I was going to hike the next 12 miles across a pretty flat valley. I’ll have to say that it was some of the nicest trail that I had hiked so far. I went for several miles hiking along the edges of fields. After awhile I think the trail organizers must have gotten embarrassed that we weren’t hiking in any kind of woods, because for some more miles the trail turned into a strip of woods that was maybe 100 feet wide. We were still walking between fields but hey, we were in woods.
Eventually we came back out and just hiked in the fields again. It was here that I met some relatives of some of the animals I had met in Virginia. I was about halfway across a field when I came face to face with the Wild Cows of Pennsylvania. Like the ones I ran into in Virginia they weren’t openly hostile, but I had about a hundred pair of eyes watching me pretty intently. They had that same look in their eyes that my daughter’s dog Dixie gets when you go into the kitchen “You can’t fool me, I know you have food and you should give me some of it” type of look.  I’m not certain, but I think that if I had dropped my backpack there could have been a stampede.  Instead, I kept calmly walking to the edge of the field, but I could feel all those eyes on me the whole time.  After that close encounter, the rest of the hike was uneventful.
When I got to the shelter, there was only one other hiker. He’s 69 years old and he’s from Orlando. He thru hiked the trail about 10 years ago and his trail name is Grinder.  Like me, he started the trail again in Georgia and got just passed Boiling Springs. He flew up from Orlando this morning and picked up where he had left off.  We are both heading to Duncannon tomorrow.
I did get to test out my new shoes today. I ran into some really wet and muddy section in one of the fields that you couldn’t help but get you shoes completely wet. After about a mile later, I noticed that my shoes were dry again. I can live with those type of shoes.","Alec Kennedy Shelter
",Darlington Shelter,"Apr 16, Tue",18.20
Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610704,"Last night after Grinder and I had settled in, we got some folks that came up to the shelter about 10:15pm. Once they saw that we were in the shelter they decided to setup their tent anyways, even though there was plenty of room for them.  Beyond shining flashlights at us, I guess they didn’t want to disturb us.  We got some showers last night so they might have regretted it later.
We got up this morning around 6am and we’re on the trail by 7:15. The trip into Duncannon was pretty uneventful. We did get a little rain early on but not very hard. We originally hiked together for awhile and talked about missing Game of Thrones.  Since Grinder didn’t start until yesterday, he was able to see the first episode of the last season that just aired but said he wouldn’t tell me anything about it.
After awhile, we started getting some distance between us and I ran into a guy walking south with his dog Sam. The guy was pretty chatty and You could tell that Sam was growing impatient. He would start waking down the trail and then stop and look back at his owner. When he realized he wasn’t following him he would come back and pace a little and then do it all over again.  It was pretty comical because his owner was oblivious to it.
When I got into Duncannon I checked into the Doyle Hotel, which is an institution on the trail. It was a Hotel built over a hundred years ago and I’m pretty sure it hasn’t been remodeled since then. They only rent rooms to hikers and for only $25 a night.  The bar and restaurant are the main draw for the locals. The food is really good.
The reason I decided to stop here for the night is that the next shelter is only 3.5 miles away and not enough to bother with. The next one after that is 11 miles away and too far to get to today with the 10 miles I had already done. So, tomorrow I have to decide is I want to go 11 miles or 25 miles to the one after that.  The problem is that there are a line of thunder storms that will hit on Friday into Saturday. It might be better to plan on shorter distances those 2 days of bad weather.  We’ll see.
At dinner tonight Grinder told me he is going to see a Chiropractor in the morning. Seems his back is giving him problems. He’ll get back on the trail afterwards and try to make the shelter that’s 11 miles away.  I told him I might see him there.","Darlington Shelter
",Doyle Hotel,"Apr 17, Wed",10.90
Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610803,"This morning I got up and was at the one and only dinner in town at 6:15am. Besides me there was only the server and the owner present. The server was a retired construction worker and a couple of years older then me. For 15 minutes he kept me in orange juice and chocolate milk and told me all about his motorcycle trips across the country. It seems the cook doesn’t arrive until 6:30 because that was when all his retired cronies started coming in and he said it was ok for me to order now.  There were about 8 guys similar in age to my server and it was obvious this was a morning routine for them. They all took up the rest of the seats at the counter. They were a friendly bunch. They all said hello and asked me about my hiking. When the last guy came in the group kicked into gear. By then, I had my breakfast so I became an observer. They started out harassing each other and getting caught up on what they had done the day before. Then they spent a little bit of time talking about how Obama had done this and that, but then the conversation turned in a surprising way. They all talked about how they didn’t like how politics was becoming so social media focused. Saying and doing things just to get followers. A tweeter account we have all gotten to know very well was used as an example a lot. Next, the conversation turned to who they thought the Democrats would put up as a viable candidate. During this conversation there was a lot of reconfirming with each other that they had voted for the current incumbent, but they still were hotly contesting who they thought was the best Democratic candidate. When I finished, they had at least settled on the idea that it should be one of the younger candidates.
Sorry, not trying to make a political statement. It was just interesting hearing the conversation and not one that I had expected to have heard at all.
After breakfast I went back to my room and collected my stuff and headed out. It was a pretty long walk through town and then I had to cross a couple of bridges to get over the Susquehanna River. The bridges were really busy 4 lanes roads.  I had just left the hotel when I had my first bit of Trail Magic. A guy in a pickup truck stopped and asked me if he could give me a lift to the other side of the river. I gladly took him up on his offer and he dropped me off at the parking lot where the trail goes back. I thanked him for his generosity and he said he always keeps an eye out for hikers because it’s a dangerous road crossing.
The trail today was a bunch of very different terrains. Once I got to the top of the ridge, the next mile was a bolder climb. It wasn’t anything I hadn’t done before, just not for a whole mile.  To make up for it, later on I hiked about a mile on a service road that was covered in wood chips. It was like walking on pillows.
When I got to Peter’s Mountain Shelter (the one that was 11 miles down the trail) it was only 2pm and I stopped to have lunch. There was a note on the picnic table that indicated I had run into a second bit of Trail Magic. The local hiking club had dropped off some snack items and put them in the bear box (that’s where we put our food packs so the animals can’t get to them).  I had a couple bags of chips and an orange. It was pretty nice.
After lunch I decided that I would keep on hiking to the next tent site which was 5 miles further.  While I was at the dinner I saw on the weather that the storms on Friday aren’t expected to hit until in the afternoon. My thought was that it was 18 miles to the next shelter and the more miles I could do today, the more possible it would be that I could make the next shelter before the storms hit.
It had been cloudy and cool so far, but around 3pm the sun came out and the sky cleared up. That made the hiking really pleasant, so when I got to the tent site in a couple of hours I noticed that there was another one in 5 more miles.  I decided to push forward as that would only give me 8 miles to do tomorrow.  I made the second site with just enough light left to be able to get my tent setup. Once that was done, I found a good rock to sit on and fixed my dinner and enjoyed one of my favorite pastimes. Sitting under a full moon and watching all the lights come on in the valley below me.  That never gets old, and with that I’ll bid you good night.","Doyle Hotel

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610960,"Got up this morning and was out of the tent site by 7am. When I woke up I checked the weather and it was showing the storm to hit around noon. Glad I went that extra 5 miles as I only had 8 miles to go to get to the shelter which I could do before noon.
Got to the shelter around 11 and ran into a south bound hiker. He had done the same thing that I had done and tented last night so he would have a short hike to the shelter this morning. He had decided that he didn’t want to just sit around the shelter all day so he pushed on for Pete’s Mountain Shelter which was another 18 miles. He knew he would get caught in the storm, but he figured he could make Duncannon on Saturday and dry out. As much as I would have loved to go on to the next shelter, it was 13 miles away which would have been another 21 mile day. Plus, I wouldn’t have a town to go to the next day to dry out.
So, to pass the time, I patched a couple of ware spots on my backpack, washed out some clothes in the nearby stream and had lunch.
The thing that was a little maddening was that all morning the sun was coming out, the surfs were singing and the Nats were out enjoying themselves at my expense. In other words, a perfect hiking day.  If you didn’t know any better it was a perfect day for a long hike.
 Before the rain started, a father and son came into the shelter. They are from Lancaster and are hiking today and tomorrow. They also were hoping to get to the shelter before the rain started.
Well, the rain came about 3pm and it came down pretty decently until about 4:30pm.  It picked backup about 2 hours later and seemed to have settled into a steady light rain for the rest of the night. No thunderstorms, just rain.
Well, my strategy worked and it was nice to have taken a break after that long day yesterday.  Now we’ll have to see what weather tomorrow brings.","Stealth tent site

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611030,"It rained pretty decently during the evening but stopped raining some time before I got up at 6am. It still was gray out and since I didn’t have cell service I couldn’t check the latest weather forecast. Just had to go with whatever happened. 
I kind of felt bad for Josh as he got up with me and also packed up his stuff.  His father made it know that he wasn’t getting up until 8am. I felt bad for Josh because it was so obvious that he was board out of his mind just sitting in that shelter since 1pm the day before. Plus, they only had 6 more miles to hike to there car and they would go home. When I was about ready to leave he announced that he was going to hike out on his own. I took that opportunity to go to the privy so they could have a family discussion. When I got back, his father was still in his sleeping bag and Josh had settled in a corner playing a game on his phone. What a waste. I grabbed my bag and headed out.
The morning stayed gray and around noon it started with a very light rain. It did that in and off for about 90 minutes. Not hard enough or long enough to put in my rain coat.  Instead I just enjoyed the free washing of my clothes.
After that, the sun came out and started drying things out, the birds were chirping and the nats were natting. All in all a really nice Saturday afternoon. With the nicer weather I also started running into more local hikers as the section I was hiking through had a lot of really nice lookouts. At one point, there was a straight stretch of trail for several 100 feet. At the other end I could see a young couple out walking with a young Boxer. When the Boxer saw me he got really excited and ran up to greet me, then he would run back to his owners, then he would run back to greet me again. He kept doing this back and forth as I continued to get closer to the couple. The dog was just having a grand time running back and forth between us.  When I got to the couple, they said the dogs name was Oggy, he was a year old and this was his first hike on the trail with them.  He was very excited. As we started waking away from each other, Oggy still wanted to run back and forth between as. We finally got him to stay with his owners as I walked away.  He was definitely enjoying his first hike.
Tonight I’m staying at the 501 Shelter. It got it’s name because it’s right off of PA Route 501.  It one of only 2 shelters on the trail with 4 walls and a door. It has a house next door that used to be owned by a potter and the shelter used to be where he made his pottery. It’s now on State Park lands and the AT has a caretaker that lives in the house and takes care of the shelter. When I meet the caretaker, he was wearing a Univesity of Michigan Basketball sweatshirt. I asked him if he was from Michigan and he said yes from outside Detroit. I told him I was from Battle Creek. Turns out he’s 1 year older then me, graduated from U of M as a Nurse and settled in PA. After exchanging bards about each other’s schools, he gave me some good tips on what to expect on the trail in front of me.
One other thing about this shelter is that since it’s right by a road and 4 miles from Pine Grove PA, you can have food delivered. I was planning on just ordering a small pizza, but I had to order a couple of other sides to get to the delivery limit. When The food got here, I ran into the caretaker on my way back to the shelter and invited him to share dinner with a fellow Michigander.  He accepted and brought some cake that he had made as his part of the meal. It was a great way to wrap up the night.","Rausch Gap Shelter

For the second time, we were treated to some trail magic for Easter. A local named Ed showed up at 6am with coffee and bagels with cream cheese. We enjoyed our bagels as we packed up. Ed had brought 6 bagels but there were only 4 of us, so I took one to have later for lunch. So, even though I didn’t get an Omelette breakfast and made to order sandwiches for lunch like last year, I still got breakfast and lunch.  I added a slice of Spam to the bagel for lunch, so I guess I still had Easter ham (well kind of ham like).
For the first time on the trail, I ran into a couple of guys riding horses. Normally only foot traffic is allowed on the AT, but there have been several side trails that will cross or join up with the AT for a short bit where horses are allowed. This is just the first time I’ve actually come across some.  This part of the trail was going along an old forest service road so there was plenty of room for both of us to past each other.

I thanked him, put my stuff in the back of his pickup truck and got, or at least tried to get into the front seat. I had to wait for Missy, a 5 year old Pug, to make room for me. Once I was in she immediately moved back to her seat (now my lap) and settled in. I also got that “you can pet me now” look so I did.  I think I had made a new friend when I got out.
It was a really nice day out today. Later it actually got hot, especially when I was hiking up hill. I ran into Nick about midday as I was seating by the trail having lunch. I had first meet Nick in Duncannon where he also stayed at the Doyle Hotel. Nick is a thru hiker that started February 2nd. It was one of those days when we would leap frog past each other throughout the day. There were a lot of lookouts along the trail so I got Nick to take a picture of me so that I could verify that I was on the trail and not seating in some bar somewhere making these stories up and copying pictures from the internet.  Now that I think about it, that might not be a bad idea.
When I got to the shelter, Nick was already there as well as Happy. Happy is a 70 year old thru hiker that started in Harpers Ferry and is working his way north. With the exception of Nick (he’s in his 20’s), so far the majority of the hikers out here are us old guys. There was a father/daughter couple staying in a tent near the shelter, but the father came over and said they were going to leave and go home (they where locals) because he say that we’re supposed to get rain tonight. None of us had seen that prediction this morning so Happy checked and sure enough we were supposed to get rain tonight.

Back in Duncannon, Grinder had told me that once you passed Port Clinton/Hamburg that the rocks everyone complains about in Pennsylvania would really show up, and he was right. Of the 17 miles that I hiked today, almost 10 of those were in serious rocks. The picture of the rocks was just one section. You would go over rocks like those and then come off the boulders to just hike on a trail littered with smaller rocks. Then you would do it all over again. It was almost like they had taken all the rocks from the rest of the trail down to Georgia and dumped them in that 10 mile section.  I’ve got about 39 miles left in Pennsylvania and I know of at least 2 more similar sections full of rocks we still have to go through. Well, by the end of the day Friday I should be out of Pennsylvania.  I’ve been told that New Jersey still has rocks, just not as long sections of them.
I did meet a local couple, Pat and Alice, both in their mid 60’s, that we’re out hiking this rocky section. They are doing it as part of their training to get ready to thru hike the AT next year.

The choice was Bert’s as it was the local dinner.  The food was good and it hit the spot. It was nice to have a decent meal when you can. 
This was one of those dry days where there isn’t any water for over 12 miles. Turns out that there was a lot of Zinc mined and processed around Palmerton since the late 1800’s. The mill closed down about 20 years ago and now the whole area is an EPA Superfund site. I loaded up with water before I hit the trail and it wasn’t a problem because but was cool. I can’t imagine hiking almost 15 miles without water in the heat of the summer.
I’ve been kind of surprised that I haven’t seen more wildlife on the trail, but today I ran into 2 deers. They were having lunch on the new foliage and although they kept an eye on me, I wasn’t interesting enough to interrupt their lunch.

Just long enough for us to get packed up and back on the trail. I was the first out, but Wolf has me by about 8 inches in height so he caught me pretty quickly. After about an hour on the trail it started to rain again and pretty much rained pretty heavily on and off for the remainder of the day.  It was also fairly windy and around 50 degrees so in all a pretty miserable day. 
Wolf was planning on only going 14 miles to the next shelter. It was another 6 miles into Delaware Water Gap but he didn’t think he could make it that far. I got to the shelter around 3pm and found Wolf sitting on a camp chair inside the shelter that someone had left. The shelter was a horrible place to stay given the weather because the shelter was up near the top of the ridge facing South and the storm was coming out of the South. At that party time it had stopped raining but the wind was blowing straight into the shelter. If it started raining again (which it did) it would soak everything in the shelter. Even though he said he was beat, I convinced him to go with me the last 6 miles into Delaware Water Gap and stay at a hostel run by the Presbyterian Church. He agreed and that’s where we are spending the night.
I think I may take a zero here tomorrow and let my legs get rested up after all those rocks.
A little refresher - A zero is where you stay off the trail and don’t do any hiking that day. A nero is where you hike to somewhere and spend the rest of the day off the trail. You have still hiked some miles so it’s a near zero day or nero.Technically I’m not out of Pennsylvania until I cross the bridge over the Delaware River.James - I’ve had some really nice hiking days and some really great views in Pennsylvania, but I’m glad it’s behind me.","Leroy A Smith Shelter

There were 4 other hikers with us in the hostel. One was going North, the others South. All 4 left in the morning. Wolf (I’ve been spelling it incorrectly) and I went and had breakfast at a really nice bakery here (Village Farmer and Bakery). My plan afterwards was to stop by the Outfitter and replace my insoles (I learned that they slid around and bunched up in my shoes while hiking in the rain - not a good thing) and my cooking stove (it had quite working the night before). I knew that the Outfitter is only open Saturday and Sunday until May so no problem, today is Saturday. When I got there, they had a sign on the door saying they were closed today because of a biking event they were hosting. Major Bummer since they weren’t opening until 10am on Sunday. I checked and there was a Dick’s Sporting Goods store in Stroudsburg 6 miles away.  Time to figure out how to do Uber. Luckily I got it worked out and had a successful trip. 
When I got back, I spent some time rechecking my gear and making some adjustments when Wolf came in and said that someone from the Church told him about a laundromat in town and we decided to search it out and clean our clothes. We looked all over for where it he had been told it was but couldn’t find it. We asked some of the employees at the Bakery and they said there wasn’t one. I googled it and found one 3 miles away. Once again it was time for Uber. With laundry done, Wolf and I came back and decided to go to a local BBQ joint for dinner.

Wolf and I went our separate ways this morning. He was only going to do 10 miles and stop at the Mohican Outdoor Center because the first shelter is 25 miles. I was going to push on to that shelter.  Because he was only doing 10 miles, he was going to go to the bakery when they opened at 8am and have breakfast. I left at 7am because it was going to be a long day for me.
The weather forecast said it was going to rain today, and just after I left the hostel it started raining. It was a steady but light drizzle for the morning but it actually cleared up around noon.  It stayed cloudy and cold the rest of the day though. Tonight it’s supposed to get to below freezing. Who said we are almost in May?
I met an interesting couple today. They are hiking the AT with an RV. What they do is find a place to park the RV, then they use the car they are towing to drive to an access point for the AT and then hike to the RV. That way they always end there day being able to sleep in their RV. In the morning they go pickup their car and do it all over again. They started at Springer, but got to Virginia and decided it was taking to long so they skipped Virginia. They said they will go back and do it later. Since they are retired I wasn’t sure why the skip, but it’s their party.
I want to end by making a correction on what I had said about Wolf earlier because I misunderstood him. He didn’t start in Harpers Ferry and is doing a flip-flop. In 2015 he started at Springer and got as far north as Boiling Springs before his time ran out and he needed to go back to work.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611944,"There were 3 of us in the shelter last night and we all agreed that it got really cold last night. It was supposed to get down to 32 degrees and we weren’t arguing.  It was a blue sky and as the day wore on, I was able to discard all the extra layers I had started with.
Of the 3 of us, only two of us were heading north and the other one heading south. The 2 of us left together, but after about 4 miles we hit Culvert and he wanted to find a way to resupply so I went on by myself.  Just as I was passing a parking lot off the AT at Culvert, I noticed the 2 folks that are hiking the AT via RV. They were getting ready to hike the 15 miles back to where they started yesterday and pickup their car and then come back to the camper to spend the night. I also learned that they had thru hiked the AT together 4 years ago the normal way. They came up with this idea to try something different.  I included a picture of the RV.
Later, I came to a crossroad where another trail cross the AT. As I was entering the intersection I happened to look to my right and less the 10 get away was a really big porcupine waddling up the side trail to the intersection. We both stopped and looked at each other for a second, but I knew he was definitely better armed then I was. I decided it wouldn’t workout well for me if I challenged him to the right-of-way, so I scooted quickly on and kept up the pace to put some safe distance between us. After about 40 feet, I turned around just uptime to see the porcupine continue on his merry way.
The shelter I’m staying in tonight is the “secret” shelter because it’s not an official ATC built shelter. Jim Murray owns a farm and the rear of the property is only 0.2 miles from the trail. He thru hiked the trail back in 2016. When he got home from the trail, he built the cabin and put in a well as a payback for the trail.  It’s a secret because the official trail guide doesn’t list it. The other guid put out by Guthook does list it. It’s really nice as it’s got 4 walls, a door and some windows. It also has a wild donkey that wandered over to see what I was up to. It’s a really nice place to spend the night  and it’s only 1 mile further to get into Unionville, NY where I’ll pickup a food  package my wife sent me.

Technically speaking, last nights shelter was in New York. The last part of the trail in New Jersey runs close to the New York boarder.
The weather forecast was for rain today but it all happened during the night. It stayed overcast and looked like it could rain any minute but it never did. I like it when all the rain happens while I’m sleeping and is clear when I hike. Makes it very convenient.
I got up this morning and got into Unionville as the Post Office was opening up and got my food box that my wife had mailed me (thank you very much). I went across the street to the General Store/Deli and eat a breakfast sandwich while I packed away the food. I still had a days worth of food left plus some snacks that I hadn’t eaten yet, so I hit the trail with 5+ days of food. My food bag is really full.  Having said that, the trail cross NJ Rte 94 and about 100 yards from the trail crossing was A hot dog stand. It was lunch time and a hot dog sounded good so I stopped and had one. Mitch is the owner and ex-Navy. I was his only customer at the time so he sat with me for awhile and we shared sea stories until some other customers showed up. Next, about 2 miles before I got to the shelter the trail crosses NY Rte 17A and there is the Bellvale Farm Creamy. It’s kind of an institution on the trail. Mainly because most of the hikers hit here in the dead of summer and it’s great getting ice cream right by the trail.  I did take the opportunity to stop in and have a sundae for dinner. So, having started out the day with a fully restocked food bag, at the end of the day I hadn’t eaten any of it yet.  Up here there are a lot more opportunities to eat just off the trail then down south.
Tonight I sharing the shelter with 2 other guys. One started at Harpers Ferry and is going north, but had to get off the trail for a week for family reasons. He just came back on the trail today. The other guy is going south, but only to the NJ/NY boarder. He started on the trail last Saturday.  It has been interesting how many people are on the trail.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612151,"Today was back to being pretty rough hikes. The mountain ranges are running north/south and today’s trail was running east. That meant that I had steep inclines and declines one after another. Several of them had some real rocky paths to navigate while going up or down. At the end of the day I was pretty beat, especially after some really long days before today. 
The real interesting thing of the day was running into a bear. I had gotten to a point where the my trail turned left and another trail when on straight in the direction I had been going. I stopped to make sure I was supposed to turn left, and as I looked down my trail I thought I saw an animal in the trail. It was about 100 yards away and just slowly wandering down the trail towards me. As I watched it, I realized that it was a large bear. About this time it noticed me and we looked at each other for awhile. After awhile the bear started back slowly wandering down the trail at me. I figured that I would let him have the trail so I went up the other trail for a bit to get out of his was.  I stopped and just watched him continue to slowly wander south on the AT until he was out of sight. He never acted aggressive or concerned about me. He did look in my direction every once in awhile, but otherwise it was like he had more important things to do, just not that he needed to get to the quickly. I decided that he probably didn’t need me to tell him about the rocks he was going to run into, I’d let him work that out on his own.","Wildcat Shelter

The 2 big things for today was to hike up to the top of Bear Mountain, which is the high point around here. When I got to the top it was a little disappointing, because although there was a really nice view of the Hudson and surrounding mountains, it was too hazy to see the skyline of NYC.
The second highlight was that between Bear Mountain and the bridge to take you across the Hudson, the trail takes you right through the Trailside Museum & Zoo.  It’s meant to show people the typical stuff you would find on the trail. The Bear I saw yesterday looked a lot nicer then the Bear in the zoo.
After having the past 4 days with highs only in the 50’s and overcast, today turned sunny and warm early. I wasn’t expecting that so I was still dressed for cooler temperatures. After 5 days on the trail even I didn’t like how I smelled. With 2 climbs of 600 and 800 feet each, in the mid 70’s, wearing long pants and long sleeve shirt where just making matters worse.  Since I had already met my hiking miles quota by reaching 300 miles today, I decided to take a break and give myself a day off on Friday. I checked into the Bear Mountain Bridge Hotel in Fort Montgomery, which is just a few miles from West Point.  I’m definitely a Navy guy in a very Army town.  But hey, I have clean clothes and after a very long shower I can’t smell myself before I get somewhere, so all is well.","William Brien Memorial Shelte

I did need to replace a pair of socks so I went to the Post Exchange and picked out a pair. One thing the Army has are socks. Lots and lots of different types of socks.

I had a mile to walk from the hotel to the trail, but it was all literally down hill.I’m glad I got started early because tomorrow we’re supposed to have some major rain starting in the middle of the night. I either had to do 25 miles today to get to the next shelter or stop somewhere before then and setup my tent. Setting up and taking down the tent isn’t a big deal, it’s just something you want to avoid doing in the rain if you can help it.I’m really liking how the northern half of the trail has such easy access to stuff over the southern half. Around 11am the trail dumped me on a road and the trail literally ran through the parking lot of a Shell station across the street. I took the opportunity to get a drink and sandwich and take a little break.So far I’m liking the trail on the northern side of the Hudson River. The climbs aren’t as bad and the trail is less rocky.

The only thing that was missed was the amount of rain. It called for heavy rain all day, but all it did was a steady drizzle. It did quite here and there but for the most part it rained all day. It is supposed to rain into the night and final stop before sunrise.Given that it was raining all day, it was a little slow going on the trail. There was a lot more mud and just slick sections. I always take a little extra caution in the downhill sections because of that. Too easy to slip.I knew I was going to pass a lake with the name “Nuclear Lake”. I’m sure there is a story somewhere about how it got it’s name. That is a pretty unique name. There isn’t anything around it that might lend itself to having the lake named that way. When i walked alongside it I didn’t see any 2 headed turtles or green glowing water.  It just all looked normal.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612696,"Today turned out to be a much different day then I had planned. The plan was that I would get up this morning and hike into Connecticut and stop to see a covered bridge.  That plan lasted for about the first mile. About then I pivoted on my right shoe and almost the whole right side of the shoe ripped open. Kind of like what happened to Zion and his Nike sneakers, except only I didn’t get hurt by it. Either way, doing anymore hiking in those shoes was out of the question. As luck would have it, I was within a few miles of getting to Pawling NY. Luckily the last couple of miles of trail to get to the road into Pawling were easy and flat.  I figured that my option would be to see if I could stay somewhere in town until I could get some new shoes sent to me.  Fortunately my luck was still holding and I saw that Pawling had a train station for a commuter train into New York City and I also saw that there was an REI store fairly close to Grand Central Station and just like that I was spending the day in the Big Apple.
Not only did I get my shoes changed out (I left the old ones at REI, they promised to give them a good burial), but I also had some time to wander around a little bit. See Time Square, Rockefeller’s Square and browse the windows of the stores in 5th Ave. luckily I had only been on the trail for a couple of days so I didn’t smell like some homeless person.  I also just had to stop into a Pizza place and get a slice of New York style pizza for lunch.
I caught the  3:44pm train back to Pawling and got in at 5:30. To late to get back on the trail so I’m spending the night at the Station Inn.  Might as well take full advantage of the day off and get cleaned up and wash my clothes. Especially my socks.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612779,"Several people that I talked with that had done the trail before said that Connecticut was the easiest part, and so far that has held up.
Although I had liked the Altima Timp 1.5’s, I had decided to go back to the Merrell Moab Vent which I wore for the first half of the trail.  A pair lasted me for over 800 miles so these should see me to the end. With the Altima’s only lasting 350 miles, I would have to buy 2 more pairs before I’m done. 
I was worried about how far I would be able to go today with breaking in new shoes. As it turned out it wasn’t a problem.  Before I started I had taped the typical spots I had issues with back when I started on the trail. I still had to address some additional spots during the day, but for the most part, they weren’t an issue.
I got up and out by 6:45 this morning knowing that I had a 2.5 mile hike to get back to the trail. I got lucky and a guy stopped and asked me if I was heading to the trail and that he would give me a lift. So, by 7am I was back on the trail.  The day was going to be a great day for hiking, warm, sunny and a nice breeze.  A perfect hiking day.
After a couple of hours, I was leaving New York and entering Connecticut. Connecticut is like Maryland in that you only have about 50 miles to go before you’re into Massachusetts.
The next town the trail came by was the Village of Bull’s Bridge, which still has it’s 19th century covered bridge (picture included). On the other side of the bridge is a place called the Bull’s Bridge Country Store. It’s an institution on the trail. It’s just a really quaint store with a deli. They also have free WiFi, electrical outlets so you can charge stuff, a bathroom and food. Everything a hike needs. The owners are also very friendly to hikers.
For pretty much the rest of the afternoon I followed the Housatonic River. Later in the afternoon I was going to drop into Kent which was just over on the other side of the Housatonic. At the bridge I decided not to go because of the threat of some late afternoon showers. Instead I walked by the Kent School, which is this private Prep School. It is a really beautiful campus and I seemed to be walking by all the sports fields. There were kids out playing about ever sport you can imagine. I was passing by a bunch of young ladies relaxing on the grass. Turns out they were the ladies varsity tennis team and their coach. Some of them asked me if I was hiking the AT and when I said yes they all started asking me questions about my experiences. We talked for about 15 minutes. Even the coach had some questions. It was a pretty fun interaction. They have a game coming up on Thursday so I wished them luck.
I continued to hike along the Housatonic River until I came to the shelter. I almost made it all the way before the rain that was predicted started in. My 15 minute conversation with the tennis team held me up just enough, but the conversation was still worth it.
The only thing that was odd about today was that I never saw another hiker all day.  This is the first day of not seeing even just a day hiker on the trail.","Pawling, NY

I got up and was on the trail at my usual 7am time. Like yesterday, I continued to hike along the Housatonic River. Although we did move up and away from the river periodically. 
I hiked by the towns (Villages) of Cornwall, West Cornwall, Falls Village and finally Salisbury.  I did make 2 short excursion from the trail. The first one was into West Cornwall to see the covered bridge (picture included). The second one was into Falls Village. I decided to stop and have lunch at the Mountainside Cafe. The write up for the Cafe in the trail guide said that they had excellent milkshakes. I’m more of a malt guy, but hey, after 2 warm days on the trail I was ready for one.  They lived up to their reputation. The shake was excellent.
When I left Falls Village, my plan was to stop at the shelter between there and Salisbury, but when I got there I still had almost 3.5 hours left of daylight so I decided to go for the one just past Salisbury. Because of the terrain (where was that nice flat section along the Housatonic River when you need it) it took me longer to get to Salisbury then I planned. Plus, I had decided to swing into the Market/deli in Salisbury and get a sandwich to eat for dinner at the shelter. No problem I told myself, you can just hustle those last 3 miles out of Salisbury to the shelter. One sandwich later and I was back on the road heading to the trail. It was then that I checked my watch and the guide one more time and got reminded that I had a 1,200 foot climb immediately right out of Salisbury and then another mile to get to the shelter. I also knew that I only had a litttiver an hour left before the sunset. No way was I going to make that climb and get to the shelter before dark set in. At this point I remembered that there was a hostel in Salisbury run by Vanessa. The guide had her number so I called and she could take me in. She told me where she was located in Salisbury so I hiked back into town. When I got checked in, I found that there was another section hiker (Miles - real name) that had checked in earlier. He is also going North and started last weekend for 2 weeks on the trail.  Miles went out for dinner, but since I had already gotten a sandwich, I stand in and eat. Vanessa has 2 dogs and both were hopping I would share some with them (I didn’t).

They opened up at 7am and I was there at 7:05am. I had a cinnamon bun and hot chocolate for breakfast and got a herb bacon biscuit to have as a snack later in the morning. One could get used to this type of hiking. You didn’t have all these options on the southern section of the trail or have so many towns so close to the trail.
The highlight of today was that I left Connecticut and entered Massachusetts. If there was a sign showing the border I missed it.
The one thing that I ran into pretty quickly in Mass that I hadn’t realized I had missed in Connecticut was cows. I walked by several cow pastures today and realized I hadn’t seen a single one in Connecticut.
A cold front has definitely moved in tonight. Temperatures have dropped a lot since I got to the shelter.
I’m sharing the shelter with a mom (CC) and daughter (Sam) who are 6 days into there hike. They are heading to Hanover NH. Today is CC’s birthday.

I actually got out by 6:30am because I had 20 miles to get to the shelter and the forecast was for the real nasty rain to hit later in the afternoon and I wanted to be settled in by then. I was really looking forward to getting to this shelter because it is actually a 2 story cabin on Upper Goose Pond. One of the premier shelters on the whole trail. Plus, because it is an enclosed cabin, I knew it would be warmer and dryer then a normal shelter. A perfect place to end on a cold wet day.  So after hiking 20 miles, I get to the turn-off to go to the cabin, and there is a sign saying that the cabin is closed. I was devastated. Not only where my plans of spending a night in a dry warm location crushed, but the next shelter was over 8 miles away. Did I mention that the worst of the rain was coming late afternoon and early evening?  I hiked a couple more miles to get to Rte 20 where Lee, MA was about 5 miles away.  I checked and they had some inexpensive hotels so I tried to get an Uber into town. There must have been only 1 Uber driver because my requests were always unable to be assigned to a driver. I was worried that I was going to have to walk into town (have I mentioned that coming rain) when a lady came out of the business who’s parking lot I was standing in and asked me if I was heading into Lee. When I said yes she offered to drop me off in town. Things had definitely picked up, plus it had stopped raining while I was trying to do this.  When i got into town I picked the cheapest of the 4 hotels in town. So, as it turns out, I got my dry and warm spot for the night.One last thing. As I was doing one of the road crossing for the day I noticed a farm next to the parking area (they always have a parking area at these road crossings to allow local people access to the trail).  Actually, what I noticed about the farm was an odd looking herd of animals.

Yesterday when the lady gave me a ride into town she turned off Rte 20 and took me on some backroads and dropped me off in the center of town. So when the driver went through the center of town this morning I didn’t think anything of it until we had been driving for awhile. At this point I knew something was a miss, but I figured what the heck, I get a head start on the trail.
Today was one of those days that started out cold, but by mid afternoon it had warmed up and we had blue skies. There were a lot of great views because it wasn’t cloudy. The shelter I stopped at is about 3.5 miles from the top of Greylock Mountain, the highest peak in Massachusetts. I debated on continuing on to get to the peak because tomorrow is supposed to be cloudy early, but the next shelter would have been another 4 miles on the other side of the top.  I didn’t want to get in another situation of stretching the day to far.

Last year’s was an exceptional hot day and I was worried about getting heat exhaustion. This year I had to hike in the snow and I was worried about hyperthermia and frost bite.
Compare the picture on yesterday’s entry with the one for today and you’ll understand why I say Mother Nature has a twisted sense of humor.
This morning I got up at 6am as usual and as I was getting ready to head out at 7am, I noticed a few snow flakes in the air. The forecast was for some rain today not snow so I didn’t think any thing about it.  However, as I was hiking the snow really started coming down. This was a real reminder of the difference between the weather at 500 feet and that of over 3,000 feet in elevation.  Within a couple of hours, I couldn’t see the ground anymore and if I was stepping on rocks, roots or the ground.  Things were be becoming a real mess.  Especially since you have to remember that I left for the trail thinking it was Spring and had only packed 2 shorts, 2 t-shirts and a rain coat.  Not exactly the best outfits for hiking in sub-zero weather in the snow.  Luckily, along the way I had picked up a long sleeve shirt, a pair of tights and a wind and waterproof rain suite(top and pants that will help retain my body heat).  I had put all that extra stuff on before I headed out.  It helped keep me warm, but not something that I could have hiked a long distance in.  Since the shelter was near the summit of Greylock Mountain, I knew that I only needed to hike around 4 miles before I would start coming down the other side. I was figuring on it warming up a little as I came down and the snow turning to rain.  This is exactly what happened although it still stayed in the lower 40’s. The only thing that I was still worried about was my hands. I had gloves on, but they were warm weather gloves meant to protect my hands from getting blisters from my hiking poles not protecting them from the cold.
As I neared the bottom of the mountain, I ran into a Botanist from Williams College in Williamstown, MA and her husband.  She was out checking on some plants she was monitoring and was just finishing up and offered me a ride into Williamstown, which I accepted.
I knew I needed to upgrade my wardrobe for colder weather as I was getting into higher elevations, so I had my wife send some long pants to me in a resupply box. Unfortunately that box was waiting for me in Manchester, VT, another 2 days down the trail. Plus, the weather for the next 2 days we’re going to continue to be very cold and rainy, and I would still be hiking around 3,000 feet from here until New Hampshire. Not a good solution for me.
When I got into Williamstown, I went and hung out at a Dunkin Donuts, drinking hot chocolate while I worked out a plan.  My plan was to get to Manchester and retrieve the box my wife had sent me and hold up there for a couple of days until this arctic front from Canada had moved on. The trail guides list people that are willing to shuttle hikers around for a fee, and I located one in Williamstown who would take me to Manchester. I made hotel reservations through Wednesday morning so I was set.  Turns out there are a lot of outlet stores in Manchester so I’m also hoping I can locate some warm gloves for my hands.
So, I’m checked in and all set to hibernate in Manchester for the next 2 days.
To respond to a couple of comments:
Sorry Katherine, I think that was a an auto correct thing. I meant Cornwall and West Cornwall not Cromwell.
Thanks Rich. The Scouts did a nice job at the shelter and I appreciate the folks like you that keep up the trail for us. Thanks for that.

Near the summit I popped out into a wide open area that the trail went along. After a few minutes I realized that I was hiking on a ski run. There was a lot of snow here, often over my boots. Sure enough when I got to the top of the run there was a ski lift.
The trail continued on with snow for most of the morning. It wasn’t until then that we dropped back down to where the snow had pretty much melted.  The only issue was that all that melted snow caused lakes of mud or just lakes where the trail should have been.

He’s 66 and is also a retired Naval Officer.   He did Virginia and West Virginia last spring and then started at Springer Mountain this January heading North. He skipped over Virginia and West Virginia on his way. He had a toe that got infected in Massachusetts and had to have it treated so he came off the trail for 2 weeks. That was how I caught him.  After we cross Killington tomorrow he’s going to stop and come back on when the trail has had a chance to warmup and dry out.  He’s got relatives in Vermont so he’s going to go visit them.
Badass is hiking faster then me so he got into the shelter about 45 minutes before me. When I got in, he asked me if I had seen a bear a couple of miles back as he had seen one there. It wasn’t my day as I had missed it. But, I did have one up on him in that the trail crosses a forest service road then goes back into the woods for the last mile to the shelter. In that mile, the trail crosses a pretty decent stream (or small river).  When I was coming across the road I ran into a lady that was out riding her mountain bike on the road. She told me I was better off to continue on the road as it would take me to the shelter.  Plus, she mentioned that last year when Irma came through it had washed out the bridge crossing on the trail, but the road’s bridge was still good.  When I got to the shelter from the road, my boots were nice and dry while Badass was drying out his because he had to walk through the river to cross it.  It’s all about timing.","Little Rock Pond Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613761,"Badass and I got up this morning at 5am and were on the trail by 6:15. It had started to rain about 3am but it seemed it was tempering off so we decided to make an early start of it. We knew that going over Killington at 4,200 feet would be challenging enough, and we weren’t disappointed.  At about 3,500 feet we started running into snow. This wasn’t 3-4 inches like the other day but deep drifts that hadn’t melted. The snow had a crust on top that you could walk on, but you would often break through and g knee deep in the snow.  Once I broke through the snow crust and fell at the same time. Badass had to help extract me from the drift.  When we started down, we shifted to the western side of the mountain which got more sun and warmer air so the snow cleared up pretty quickly. What didn’t was the mud. With all that snow still melting you would get these large muddy sections that just kept your feet wet.  We finally made it to the bottom and said our goodbyes. Badass was going into Rutland, VT to get a rental car so he could visit relatives nearby and then drive home. We swapped phone numbers so we could keep in touch.a","Governor Clement Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613871,"Today was the first nice day I’ve had in a week.  Over night the clouds had moved out and I woke up to a blue sky with only a few clouds around. It stayed that way for most of the day.  Temperature wise it was nice. Although it was a clear day the temperature didn’t get much above 60, so a. Dry comfortable hiking day.  Plus the heights were not much above 2,000 feet so no snow. Yea.
I had been warned by a guy going south that there were a really steep section that I would be going down just past Stony Brook. He greatly understated that situation.  After some hiking, I did come to a section of boulders that I needed to climb down. What I didn’t realize was that I got to part where there was about an 8 foot straight drop. No way could you have climbed up or down that shear faced rock. What I did get a kick out of was that someone had hiked in an aluminum ladder that you use to get up or down. So, I dropped my poles down and then climbed down the ladder. Now I can pretty much say I’ve done it all on the trail.
I had read that tonight was going to be the night of the Yellow moon. That’s what the full moon is called at this time of year because of all the blooms. Unfortunately, not too long after I got to the shelter then the clouds started moving in again and I’ve gone from blue sky to clouded over again.  All those clouds mean just one thing . . . . More rain is predicted for early in the morning until mid day tomorrow. So much for the nice weather.
Regarding New Hampshire.  Two Rangers came by the shelter yesterday evening. They were out checking on the trail and the shelters . I asked them about what they knew about the White Mountains and they both said that the conditions in the Whites is still pretty bad. That there is still a lot of snow, especially above the 4,000 foot level and that the hiking conditions are pretty perilous right now.  Later in the afternoon I ran into 2 southbound hikers that were really northbound hikers that got into the Whites and couldn’t get through even with snowshoes. They had turned around and were hiking back to Killington and were going to take the Long Trail (that’s the trail that goes from the Vermont/Mass border to the Canadian border, the AT and the Long Trail are the same trail for the lower half of Vermont) the rest of the way to Canada. They are hoping that will be a long enough time for them to be able to cross the Whites.  Based on those 2 reports I think I’m going to have to call it quite store this section of the hike in Hanover and save the last section of New Hampshire and Maine to a time of better weather.","Stony Brook Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613970,"Today was a perfect day for hiking. The forecast was for thunderstorms in the morning but all I got was a little drizzle early on and then the skies cleared up.  It actually got to be a pretty warm day but there was a stiff breeze that kept things relatively cool, and I was in the shade (that tunnel of green).
The other thing that made today a really nice day was that I knew I wanted to stop at the shelter right outside of Hanover so it was going to be an easy distance day. On top of that, the terrain became really easy. I only had one decent climb and that was getting into the shelter.
The trail did go through West Hartford, VT, but it isn’t much of a place (i.e. no place to get a drink on a warm day). Kind of one of those 4 corner villages.
One thing that was kind of cool was that I walked by a meadow that was full of dandelions.  That’s probably why last nights moon was called the yellow moon.
I ran into a ton of hikers today. Most were out for the day and hiking either to Hanover or from Hanover.  I think over the past week I have seen only about a half dozen other hikers on the trail. Today I easily saw more then a dozen people. Given the lower terrain, the easier trail and the great weather (plus it’s Sunday) I guess I shouldn’t be surprised.
Tomorrow I have an easy 5 miles into Hanover. I’d like to say I’ll sleep in and get a latter start, but I just can’t sleep in on the trail. I’ve been up pretty consistently at first light. That’s usually now a little after 5am.
It has started raining a little bit ago. It’s supposed to ran during the evening but be cleared up by morning. We’ll have to see if tomorrow gets screwed up unlike today and the rain sticks around for those last 5 miles into town.  Did I say rain, it’s actually turned into those thunderstorms we didn’t get this morning.","Cloudland Shelter

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614145,"Today was definitely going to be an easy day. All I had to do was get to Hanover to meet my wife.  She was driving up from the Washington DC area and wouldn’t get in until the afternoon.
Because of that, I decided to stick around the shelter a little later then I would normally, especially since it was still a little drizzly out.  About 8am things seemed to be clearing up so I hit the trail.  Actually things worked out fine except for a little more drizzle around 10am.
It was a pretty uneventful hike as the 2.5 miles were on pavement as we went through Norwich, VT and then across the Connecticut River and into Hanover.  The trail runs right through the downtown of Hanover.
I have decided that I’m not going to continue on through the White Mountains at this time. There is still snow and ice and they were predicting more snow tomorrow.  It just doesn’t make sense to continue into an area that is hazardous even in warm weather, when they still have winter like conditions.  It would be a more prudent thing to wait and go when conditions are better, especially since I’m not on a timeline here.  So, this is my last entry until I start the next section.","Happy Hill Shelter

Plus, this will give me a chance to get my trail legs before I hit the White Mountains.I’ll get my Covid test done on Monday and then drive a rental car to Bangor Maine within the 72 hour restriction.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629124,"Today was my first day back on the trail. It was a gorgeous day so a good day to hike to Katahdin and back. I actually hiked 10.4 miles today, but the 5.2 miles up don’t count as Katahdin is the starting point, so I only get to count the miles coming down.
Hiking to the top of Katahdin is said to be a very difficult hike and it lived up to its billing. There were sections where I was hiking over rock formations where I had to use metal hand and foot aids drilled into the rock, and some sections where you had to figure it out on your own.  I started up at 7:10am after checking in with the Ranger and getting my permit to hike to the top of Katahdin. He also registered me for my hike south out of the park tomorrow. I have to leave a copy of my permit in a box on the southern edge of the park so that he’ll know I got out. After that I started my hike to the mountain top.  It took me a little over 10 hours to hike up and back down, not counting the hour I spent at the top having lunch and enjoying the sights.  Given that there aren’t any mountains or even any hills in Florida to train on, I was pleased with my time. Heck, I was pleased that I just made it up and back down, and I feel ok to continue to hike south into the 100 mile wilderness tomorrow.
There was one thing that was kind of funny that happened today. I wasn’t too fair from the top on my way up when a group of 6 hikers passed by. Right after they had passed me, we must have hit a pocket of cell service because all of our phones started sounding that emergency broadcast signal. We all checked our phones to see what was up and it turned out it was an Amber Alert being broadcast fro Quebec, and it was in French  We all got a kick out of that. Seems when you are on a mountain in Maine you can pick up Interesting stuff from Canada.
There were about 25 people at the top while I was there, but everyone was spread out so it wasn’t crowded. There are actually 3 other trails to the top besides the one I hiked so you had people coming in from different directions. It’s supposed to rain later tonight, and as I was starting back down some clouds started coming in. It’s fun to watch a cloud basically collide with the mountain and then blow over it and down the other side. 
Well I have to go get my backpack in order, so that tomorrow I can head out to start the 100 mike wilderness.","100 Mile Wilderness Inn

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629232,"I got dropped off at Katahdin Stream Campground at 6:30 am to begin my hike south out of Baxter State Park. I spent about 10 minutes getting everything situated and putting on my pack and my rain gear. It wasn’t currently raining but it was supposed to at any moment. In fact, I probably had gotten about 15 minutes down the trail before it started drizzling. For the rest of the morning it alternated between a light to heavy drizzle.
The path out of Baxter was pretty nice. It was wide and except for sections of heavy roots or some rock fields, it was fairly level and clear. It meandered around a couple of lakes (something the trail will do a lot in Maine) and by some campgrounds that had cabins.
In the almost 5 hours it took me to get to the southern boundary of Baxter, I pretty much had experienced everything that I was expecting to do or see in Maine. I had to ford a couple of streams, the first one I was able to actually get across hopping from rock to rock as the water level was below the rocks. The next one required that I would actually have to wade across the stream because the water level was higher. I had brought flip flops for this situation. I took off my shoes and socks and tied the shoe strings together so I could put them around my neck. The water was moving pretty quickly so I had to step carefully so I didn’t get a foot pulled out from me by the current. If I had of fallen, it wasn’t like I would have been pulled down stream as the water level didn’t come up to my knees. Either way, I wasn’t looking forward to losing my balance and winding up with a soaked backpack. 
About a mile further down the trail and I had the one experience that I was truly looking forward to. I ran into a Moose. I was on a clean and level section of the trail when a female Moose stepped onto the trail from the right side about 40 feet in front of me and stopped perpendicular to the trail and just stood there. I tried to get my phone out to take a picture, but it was one of those times when it was a heavy drizzle and my phone was in a pouch under my poncho and I couldn’t do it one handed. When I turned to lean my hiking poles against a tree, it must have noticed my movements because she became alert and turned towards me. I stood there for a couple of seconds to see what she would do and she took a couple of steps towards me. That was all I needed to decide to give her complete access to the trail, so I slowly took some steps off the trail and moved behind a couple of smaller trees, but where I could still see her. She continued to take some steps in my direction so I moved about 15 feet off the trail and got behind a large tree with a couple of trunks. I could watch her between the trunks but was pretty much hidden from her. My worry was that she might have had some calfs that I hadn’t seen, if so, then she could get really aggressive. I figured it was better to be safe then sorry. Once she seemed to have lost sight of me, she continued to walk down the path in the direction I had come. I waited until I could see that she had gone a ways before I came back to the path where I saw her going around a bend and out of sight.  I regret that I wasn’t able to get a picture of her because it was a pretty fascinating site.
The rest of the trip out of the park was pretty uneventful, but I was definitely more alert to keeping a watch out for any more Moose.","100 Mile Wilderness Inn

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629334,"Today was definitely not as exciting. No Moose and no steams to have to ford. I ran into a lot more hikers today. The vast majority are heading north towards Baxter. One was a group of 8 Boy Scouts. Before they got to me, the Scoutmaster yelled “masks” and all of them pulled on face masks. I pulled up my neck gaiter and covered my face also. Most of the time one of us steps off the trail and let’s the other one pass by and don’t deal with masks unless you get into a conversation. Then pretty much everyone either puts on a mask or we keep more then 6 feet apart will we exchange trail notes.
I have run into a guy going south that seems to be going about my pace, so we met up again at the shelter (called a Lean-to in Maine)  His trail name is Bags and he’s thru hiking south. He thru hiked the PCT in 2015 and is trying a shot at the AT this year.
I hiked around several lakes today. It was really nice listening to the Loons calling off in the distance.
Had a thunderstorm roll in around mid-day. I had forgotten how much more the thunder reverberates out here. It can continue to roll on for a good 30 seconds.
The Lean-to is kind of nice, not structurally, that’s pretty normal, it has a stream that runs right in front of it. You can lay here and listen to the water going by.","100 Mile Wilderness Inn

I was kind of surprised at the number of people that were camped out last night. Besides Bags and I, we had a total of 13 other people. One couple came in after dark and were using their headlamps to find a place to pitch their tent. I’m pretty sure they managed to wake everyone one up in the process. Bags and I were the only ones heading south, the rest were heading towards Baxter. There were 3 people who were thru-hikers and heading to do Katahdin and be done. They had done a lot of stealth hiking as the trail was closed until the last couple of weeks.
The trail went by a lot of lakes today. At one point I was standing on the shore of one and a pontoon plane flew over and then came back around and landed on the lake. It went to the other end of the lake and some guys got out. Must have been bringing in some fishermen.
The trail isn’t anything that I haven’t hiked through before. Lots of rocks and roots. It’s just that in the other sections of the trail you will have patches of thick roots or rocks around more decent trail. Here, you have mostly thick roots and rocks with only a few decent parts. Makes you have to be slower and watch your step more, even if you have several miles of flat ground

The first half is flatter then the second half, so I wanted to give myself 3 more days on the trail and then hike into Monson on the 4th day. I’ve been pushing the miles these first days to get ahead, but want to cut back for the part with the higher climbs.
Today started out pretty good. Last I had checked (2 days ago) it was supposed to be a nice day. It started off overcast and then around 8am the sky opened up for about an hour. After that we got the weather I was expecting.
There were 5 hikers that came into the shelter area after I had gotten in. 4 of them were flip/flopping a thru hike. The 5th is a local out doing the wilderness.  Bags was really happy because he’s gotten to meet a group of south bounders that he can keep in touch with into Virginia.
It’s funny, but if all the people I’ve run into, only one other person has run into a Moose. There are lots of Moose droppings on the trail, but none seen. Last night Bags and I were woken up by calling out a couple of times. Definitely a weird thing to hear. 
The scenery has been really great. The trail has taken me by 3-4 lakes everyday. There have been a couple of times it would have been nice to have jumped in to cool off

The first challenge was to get over White Cap Mountain at 3,644 feet.  It’s the tallest peak I’ll climb in the 100 mile wilderness. The 4,000 plus peaks come after the wilderness.
It was nice knowing that it was going to be a short mileage day as I was able to take my time. Minus the early morning rain, it turned out to be a gorgeous sunny day with a nice breeze. Because of that, the view was great from the top of White Cap and a nice cool breeze  I took off my pack and sat down and enjoyed the view and breeze. It was also nice because you could see Katahdin off in the distance
It’s also the first night I’ve had a good breeze through my hammock. It’s gotten a little warm a couple of nights and I’ve had to kick off the sleeping bag. Good thing I’m under a bug net.
Tomorrow I’ll have to ford one stream, but many be more. I talked to a NOBO who said there is at least 5 that need to be forded before I get to Monson.

I’ll admit that hiking up White Cap Mountain yesterday was the  highest climb in the wilderness, but today there were 4 slightly lower summits and each one was a bear. Each one took multiple advantage of near vertical rock climbs over boulders that looked like they had come from rock slides in the past.  It was real slow going and I didn’t get into the shelter until 8:15pm, just a little before dark.  One of the guys I’ve sheltered with the last couple of nights was nice and refilled my water bottles for me so I could setup my hammock in the light.
One the good side of the day, the views from the top were great. Plus, there was a nice cool breeze so you felt like you had stepped into air conditioning after the hot climb up.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629525,"Today was my last day in the wilderness. Ok, so technically I still have 3 miles in the morning to get into Monson, but I’m not going to count those.
After a really hard day yesterday, I didn’t follow my normal routine and kind of was a little bit of a slug in the morning. Instead of getting out before 6am, I piddled around and didn’t get out until 7am (I would have to deal with that later).  I’ll admit it felt kind of nice taking my time and doing things at a leisurely pace.  Even though I would pay for the delay, I wish I had taken a little longer, because later everyone said that they saw a Moose swimming across the lake that the shelter was on, about 15 minutes after I left.
 Today’s hike only had 2 higher peaks up front  like yesterday. After that, there were about a dozen smaller peaks that I would have climb before I reached the shelter for the night.  Same mileage, not as many high climbs, more gentler climbs, what could be a problem?
Usually, when I’m hiking, I become pretty focused on how much progress I’ve done for the day and how much longer I have to get to the day’s end.  Today just wasn’t one of those.  It started with me turning off the main trail onto a side trail because I didn’t pay attention to the trail blazes. I went about a half mile (downhill) before I figured out that I wasn’t on the right trail. That meant I needed to hike back up the trail. In otherwise, a full mile out of my way. That ate up a little over 30 minutes to get back to the trail.  A little later I came to a river that I needed to ford, and when I got tot the other side I took a break and drank a bunch of water to try to get a little more hydrated and eat a snack.  On the second of the 2 higher hills, I took another break and checked out the view.  Way off in the distance I could see these really small whited stick like things that we’re all bunched together. I have seen windmill farms from the air so I knew that was what they were. I took another break here to just enjoy the scenery.  Later in the afternoon I had one more river that I needed to ford.  Since it was a sunny day without any breeze, I knew the river would feel great on my feet and legs because I had gotten really warm. Once I crossed the river, I left my pack and boots on the other side and walked back out into the river. The water was only deep enough to come up just below my knees and I proceeded to wash the mud and sweat off my legs and arms.  It really felt good and cooled my off. I then went back to the side of the river and took another break and drank a liter and a half of water and ate some snacks  It was then that I noticed that I still had almost 6 miles of trail left and only about 3 hours of dusk left.  I hate coming into the shelter area at dark because it’s a pain to find a place to put up your hammock in the dark. I decided that I really needed to get my butt in gear and Get down the trail.
As it turned out, I didn’t have very many challenging areas to hike over for the 4-5 small hills I needed to climb. That allowed me to pull into the last shelter with about 15 minutes of light left. If I had left on time and not goofed off as much during the day, I would have gotten in almost 2 hours earlier.  Luckily for me, the guys had set me up so I could sleep in the shelter, and had gotten me 2 liters of water from a nearby stream. That meant that in the 15 minutes of daylight left, I could get settled into the shelter and also start cooking dinner.  This was the second night that they guys I was hiking with had looked after me. In the end, it turned out to be another long day with some hard hiking, but I couldn’t complain because it was really self induced.

Chipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630036,"Well, this is my last journal entry.  I’ve decided to end my hike of the AT with the 100 Mile Wilderness.  I’ve enjoyed my hike, but I’ve spent a lot of time focusing on the AT and I think it’s time to dedicate time to other trails.  After 1,868 miles I’ve experienced pretty much all the trail has to offer, and I can do the parts of the White Mountains I’m interested in, in smaller hikes later.
One thing that I learned about what the AT meant to me wasn’t the “being one with nature”.  Sure I did some incredible things, like walking through the remains of a recent forest fire or walking 11 miles literally in a storm cloud at 6,000 feet.  I’ve seen some beautiful scenery from Georgia to Maine and I’ve hiked by Deer so close that I could almost reach out and touch them. Those are a few of the things that I’ll never forget about the trail.  However, I know that I’ll go on to other hikes that will have their own gorgeous scenery and unique experiences and they will mix with my experiences from the AT.
To me, the AT was really about the people I met along the way.  Those encounters are the memories of the AT that will always be unique to the AT and what really made it special to me.  From Butch Cassidy and Sundance from the beginning to Bags and Fortuitous in the 100 mile wilderness.  It was always amazing to me how we as total strangers just moments before, could so easily form a community with each other.  How, even though I would pretty much spend the day hiking alone, I never really felt like I was alone.  The evenings spent sitting around the Shelter fixing dinner and swapping stories with other hikers became the hiker happy hour and allowed me to met some truly incredible people of all walks of life.  We all just looked out for each other.  If someone needed something, we chipped in to help each other out.  Sometimes that was sharing some food with someone that had run out, or letting them use your battery to recharge their phone. Sometimes it was spending time with someone to make sure they were all right when you could tell they weren’t, like hiking with that lady that didn’t want to hike alone.
Besides my fellow hikers, there was all the trail magic I experienced. From the elaborate Easter breakfast to something as simple as someone leaving a cooler of soft drinks by the trail. There were so many people (Trail Angels) along the way that did such wonderful and selfless things for me. I’ll never forget how one day 4 of us shared a lunch that was actually meant for someone else, or the time the cleaning lady at the motel I was staying at left the laundry door unlocked for me so that I could wash my clothes.  Or the local guy in Connecticut that recommenced that I hike along the river into Kent.  That turned out to be one of my funnest days on the trail, and technically I wasn’t actually on the trail that afternoon.
These make up the things to me that are the essence of hiking the AT. These will be the things that I will always remember about the AT and I know I will never find anywhere else.  These will be the things I will miss most about my travels on the AT.","Leeman Brook Lean-to
